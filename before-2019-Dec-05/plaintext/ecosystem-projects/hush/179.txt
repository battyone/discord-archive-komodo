[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What is the problem

[06-Aug-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Block time looks really fast

[06-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I wonder what pools / solo miners are getting most of those blocks, nothing we have on the explorer, evidently

[06-Aug-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> blocks still flying in

[06-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thats odd, i used to be a "community contributor", now im in "marketing"

[06-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> who changed my status?

[06-Aug-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> is it a promotion Lol? cant really tell

[06-Aug-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> gigamesh, the difficulty dropped and someone with nicehash trying to grab all the low difficulty blocks, its not bad, its not good either.

[06-Aug-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> miners gaming difficulty is nothing new...and has been going on for quite some time...

[06-Aug-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> ! mining

[06-Aug-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But difficulty is still high

[06-Aug-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Fire sale

[06-Aug-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> sellers gonna sell

[06-Aug-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> into my buy orders 😅

[07-Aug-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> !mining

[07-Aug-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> hey guys Hush stil got web wallet ? wanted to ask about seting up such wallet - are there legal limitations? like regulators treat crypt oas money and you need banking license to do so at some point ? or any other certificate ? or just set up the website at specific country with no limitations ?

[07-Aug-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> @dukeleto for example Jeff Dean, Anders Hejlsberg, Donald Knuth, Ken Thompson... but in criptoworld 😉 the best dev or examples for you!!! I incluyed you sure in the list, I know

[07-Aug-19 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> !bal

[07-Aug-19 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> !price

[07-Aug-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i thought we had some nice momentum and renewed interest in Hush after the recent review. I hope we can still leverage that somehow. A new SD release would help

[07-Aug-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gigamesh Need more than that

[07-Aug-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Need to look to the wider crypto community & try to draw in new interest

[07-Aug-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> In order to do this & do it right, I'd propose targeting two sets of users.  

The first set of users will be somewhat interested, but slightly more interested in prizes, in the beginning. And I think that includes more frequent lottery, infographic contest I saw in marketing & a Hush Puzzle... The last two are more likely to create interest in the user, over the span of the activiy. And, draw in new users by showing off these drawings, for example to Twitter, Reddit, etc...

The second set of usetrs are more interested in privacy. For this, I'd recommend to be more vocal about Tails w/Silent Dragon. Or, if someone was so ambitious, to create a HUSH Linux OS.

I think the best time to initiate interest is now. And it doesn't matter why that is now, it just matters that we shift people's attention to what matters.

[07-Aug-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Those interested in privacy probably will be more tech savy. Those highly value their privacy won't be using social media like Twitter, Facebook, et al.

[07-Aug-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's very niche

[07-Aug-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I don't even know how to use tor

[07-Aug-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> There's a TOR browser you can download.

[07-Aug-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> there is TOR wiki - must have for hush to be included

[07-Aug-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Privatoshi fair enough. but the Mac/Linux/Win binaries @dukeleto mentioned as part of the new release will go along way to spread adoption

[07-Aug-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> compiling code is all very well for the l33t's but us mortals need binaries

[07-Aug-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> then running competitions and pushing adoption in priv circles should be substantially easier

[07-Aug-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> disputes with other coins (Komodo family members) is at this point a distraction

[07-Aug-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> We focus on HUSH, as a community. WE support the leadership even in difficult times. We grow stronger TOGETHER

[07-Aug-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gigamesh Releases are geared more towards HUSH users.. or releases in general

[07-Aug-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I said to do those things so we can move away from any distractions

[07-Aug-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What's done is done.

[07-Aug-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> you wanna run a competition with 100's or 1000's of people on twitter? i argue we need binaries

[07-Aug-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> compiling your own wallet to collect 50 HUSH?

[07-Aug-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> dunno man

[07-Aug-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Huh?

[07-Aug-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Compile your own wallet for 50 Hush

[07-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I argue we need both

[07-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thats not the prize...

[07-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And most projects do do both

[07-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > The first set of users will be somewhat interested, but slightly more interested in prizes, in the beginning. And I think that includes more frequent lottery, infographic contest I saw in marketing & a Hush Puzzle...

[07-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ^ these guys need binaries

[07-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ok

[07-Aug-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I like your discussion!

[07-Aug-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Some people are creative

[07-Aug-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Some people aren't

[07-Aug-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I agree with @gigamesh „these guys need binaries“

[07-Aug-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Some don't care to be creative

[07-Aug-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> That’s in every community the same @Privatoshi

[07-Aug-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> So you think telling people what they need, works?

[07-Aug-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do you think it'll draw in a lot of people?

[07-Aug-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Sorry can’t follow you...maybe my English skills are not enough, but with binaries we „telling ppl what they need?“

[07-Aug-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You think releases will bring more users?

[07-Aug-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Ofc not

[07-Aug-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> But how many users use SD?

[07-Aug-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> A new wallet release combined with a huge promotion and Marketing push (assisted by me on Daily Chain and Human Action) and we will SMASH it. The Duke is the most fiery dev out there today. The Dragon will breathe FIRE 🔥 Are you in?

[07-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What day did you write your article?

[07-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's not discussion

[07-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's you telling me, let's do this this way, thanks for your input

[07-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I don't appreciate that

[07-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I took time to think about those things

[07-Aug-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> dude the competition was your idea and a good one

[07-Aug-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> hitting up priv communities equally good

[07-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I want to help build this reality... all im saying is we (prob) need binaries

[07-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We gained 50-54 users since your article

[07-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> discord users?

[07-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Which is a very sizeable addition

[07-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> it's 17% of discord

[07-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yes

[07-Aug-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I didn't say binaries don't do that

[07-Aug-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I said incentivized activities that require people to come here and interact, might have a good effect too

[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Both = 👍

[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gigamesh  Look at Verus

[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> so what should we do @Privatoshi?

[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They do one

[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm saying look at Verus

[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They focus on one side of things

[07-Aug-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> tbh i dont know much about them....can you explain?

[07-Aug-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They focus entirely on the tech....

[07-Aug-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This article, from @gigamesh , is the first marketing done there in..... ages

[07-Aug-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I dunno. I think it's good to focus on what is more important

[07-Aug-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But you can also be doing other things to supplement it & keep people on board

[07-Aug-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I am all about the tech.
Duke & I were discussing Tails & Tor the other day

[07-Aug-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But adoption requires users.

[07-Aug-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Tails would be nice! But what would you say is the focus of Hush atm?

[07-Aug-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> in my opinion its the tech

[07-Aug-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hush is a project, like any other project, right?

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @gigamesh has wrote the first Articel since a year or so

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Okay. I bought Hush on cryptopia years ago

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Doesn't mean anything

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But I didn't know I needed to write an article to voice my opinion & have people listen to it.

[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> what r u talking about? who isnt listening?

[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> who said that you need to wrote an articel to voice your opinion....cant understand this part
