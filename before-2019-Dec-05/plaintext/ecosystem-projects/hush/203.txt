[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gotta spread the love

[26-Aug-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I find great joy in randomly giving out Hush tips, probably more than I should

[26-Aug-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My hope is that it really helps some people in the future, when they are really in need of some privacy

[26-Aug-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and also helps people that want to play with some Hush but don't have the funds, or want to avoid exchanges

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> why do we want to pair it to an android phone @dukeleto ?

[26-Aug-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> to always be connected? better security?

[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> @dukeleto I think you would require a rescan in the situation of orphaned tx...if the tx didn't get rebroadcast into the next block because of conflicts. I had something like this happen before for another reason...rescanning was only way to sort out the issue and get funds back so I could try to spend again...

[26-Aug-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @hellcatz - LuckPool very interesting, thanks for that data point

[26-Aug-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh enabling wifi on your phone doesn't allow you to send+receive zxtns from your phone

[26-Aug-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh and a wormhole service is a backend server that acts as proxy to allow your desktop computer pair to your phone, even if they can't directly access each other directly (because of firewalls usually or lack of public ip+port)

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ```A slow HTTP DoS attack takes advantage of this by never sending a finishing blank line to complete the HTTP header. While some thread-based servers such as Apache use a timeout when they wait for incomplete HTTP requests, it is set to 300 seconds by default and reset as soon as the client sends the rest of the data```

[27-Aug-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so Slow Loris sends a packet every 299 secs or whatever just to keep the thread-based server hanging on

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> mornin

[27-Aug-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto i guess Apache is all patched up and that doesnt work anymore?

[27-Aug-19 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, in the 90's

[27-Aug-19 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe even before you were born üòÖ

[27-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> is it possible to store Data in the Blockchain like: Name,Address, grade... and share this (maybe via keys) to other teachers or my students?

[27-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> There is no app out there here in germany that fits for data protection regulation

[27-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Its a big problem since i dont want to work with paper...

[27-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Its not even allowed to communicate with my students via email, and so on. Well atm we do it without permission to do so...but maybe Hush technologie can fix this?!

[27-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio yes, just use the memo field. Each of your students would have a zaddr, and it would probably fit all data privacy laws

[27-Aug-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and a different way to do it, is every student could import your zaddr and "listen" to your broadcasts to them, i.e. HushList

[27-Aug-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I will try it with my students üëç

[27-Aug-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Someone off you should code a app and sell it to teachers, profs and so on üòâ

[27-Aug-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> That would be very cool

[27-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio each student would have SilentDragon, create a zaddr, give to you, then you send whatever details you want, to each student. It could all work right now (if we had good binaries now, we  don't) but the UI could be improved greatly. Things will be easier with SilentDragonAndroid, then students could setup the desktop SD once, then use an android mobile phone to send + receive memos

[27-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, you could even make your own KMD smart chain for this

[27-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so all your data is isolated even more, or use Hush for now, whatever fits the requirements

[27-Aug-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> For now (its just an experiment) i will do it with hush. I just will make zs addresses with a few Hush on it (so they can respond)

[27-Aug-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Most schools, universities and all societies who have to share private data has this problem in europe atm

[27-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> there aren't any kind of sub-addresses in ZEC/KMD forks right? Are there vanity addresses for zaddrs?

[27-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> actually HushList has a contact db iirc

[27-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Is (will) it be possible to create a database (on Blokchain) and give others access to it (maybe just on parts of data)

[27-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Its not possible to change data in the blockchain i guess...or?

[27-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio fyi, fee=0 xtns will work on Hush, but the full node won't let you send xtns for amount=0+fee=0 unless you have a non-zero balance in the wallet. Maybe I should change that, but I h aven't

[27-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio yes, you can give out a "viewkey" for a `zs1` address, and that gives somebody else the ability to see all transactions TO it, but not FROM it

[27-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and no ability to spend coins

[27-Aug-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what powers the backend of "HushLists", where you subscribe to somebody elses zaddr

[27-Aug-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> think of it as an RSS feed, powered by an encrypted data field in a blockchain

[27-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Can i ‚Äûburn‚Äú this viewkey so that i can withdraw the permission to watch data?

[27-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Share personal data of students with my teacher collegs->give them viewkeys-> teacher change->‚Äúburn‚Äú this viewkey so he/she cant access anymore

[27-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio best way is to use 1 viewkey for 1 purpose, and when done, never use it again. Sharing a viewkey is kind of like "burning" your right to privacy

[27-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since somebody else can leak your viewkey to anybody

[27-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> never using it again is best policy. Our GUI wallets need betters ways to track addresses that should not be re-used

[27-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> So its better to use it just to communicate for my usecase

[27-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> But nice, i will try it with them.

[27-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
