[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> I like HUSH, working more faster then BTC))).  But needs do next:  #1st more better design of wallet, serious design is serious money. No dragons and crocodiles. Large investors will not buy toys and etc... #2-nd  The price of  this coin, empty sites for sale (like  GRAVIEX) will not give money, it is only the service for the exchange.  It is necessary to sell the coin (goods) where there is a lot of money, example https://www.coinegg.com/

[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> Today I upload video Demo of HUSH wallet on FaceBook (FB). It is working.  Also needs upload video, how use messendger, how send files.  For demo can use  name like Edward Snowden, PUTIN, TRUMP, piople like it and will remember this ad. After this they will order same coins and test. Video needs upload on YouTube, Vimeo. This is necessary for the index in Google.

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice.  Recommend video with silent dragon

[16-Jul-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Because it is integrated with hush messenger

[16-Jul-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> the next generation, if this wallet with messenger, it should work on smartphones. People use instant messengers on smartphones more than desktops

[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> smartphone HUSH wallet + HUSH messenger on smartphone + NFC HUSH wallet

[16-Jul-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Thank you for putting effort and thought to this.

[16-Jul-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> We’ve had no price recovery since the renewed bull market, while the coin appeared promising, it’s unlikely it can remotely achieve its old price range without inclusion into a real exchange.  I don’t know how you go about that without serious investment, but it’s an unlikely prospect. I’m hopeful but realistic.  Making additional technical developments isn’t going to be enough.

[16-Jul-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> I trade on coinegg, it is powerful market, strong security based on Google  auth. Recommend .

[16-Jul-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> I am sure that the growth of HUSH can be very fast and significant.
But we must follow the recommendations. It is not enough to make a copy of  BTC, it should be better and more convenient to use (offer same options). Then the market will quickly appreciate. It's like Windows Mobile  vs Android 9.1

[16-Jul-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> For the growth of price and popularity, it is enough to make an announcement about future options, when the capitalization of the coin significantly grows, you can send money to develop these options.
Mobile HUSH NFC wallet 
Mobile HUSH crypto messenger
If a Telegram makes its own coin, why can't the coin make its instant messenger?
It is important who will be the first.

[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Hammerstein "We’ve had no price recovery since the renewed bull market" Neither has 99,9% of all altcoins. Eth at SAT Lows not seen since early 2017. ICX at all time low. WAN at all time low. OMG at all time low. It is not just hush. It is everyone. There is not "a renewed bull market" for alts. They are being destroyed by bitcoin

[16-Jul-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> Ok. So what's the deal with the Hush price decrease?  New Kids on the Block? Calm before the Storm? What?

[16-Jul-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> Looks like RunningmantheCoin answered my question at the same time I posted it.

[16-Jul-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> There is almost no volume on Hush.  The price is essentially meaningless at the moment.

[16-Jul-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> think of it this way. if nobody buys hush, the price does not change in USD. But if people buy Bitcoin and the price goes up in USD- that inherently makes Hush Satoshi level lower. it is not that people are dumping hush, it is that people are buying bitcoin more than people are buying hush

[16-Jul-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Alts are decoupling from Bitcoin for the first time in years. There will be much more pain before there will be light

[16-Jul-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> @RunningMantheCoin damn good explanation.  So the question becomes when do people buy into alts.  They definitely arent dead.  At least, not the privacy coins

[16-Jul-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> but rest assured- cryptocurrencies like hush are bubbles that cannot pop. They will always be around. and one day- our hush bubble will grow again. Much larger than the last

[16-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @anglersec historically, Bitcoin ruled the crypto world. In 2017, with the creation of ethereum contracts that let anybody mint coins, a massive shift occured. People with the know-how created new coins and marketed the living crap out of them. Then the world saw and bought them- only to realize they have no use case as ERC20 tokens. It was all a big sham (or at least 99% of it was). What we are seeing now, is the dumping of all those ERC20's and Bitcoin dominance rising to levels we havent seen in over 2 years. Is it painful? Yes. But it is also an opportunity

[16-Jul-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> unfortunatley for nearly every coin that is not bitcoin- a shadow was casted. Having a high bitcoin dominance level in the crypto world is healthy. Having a low bitcoin dominance is sign of too much hopium for shitcoins

[16-Jul-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> But rest assured- once Bitcoin rallies past its ATH of $20k (19.8 if you wanna be technical) the world will once again FOMO into bitcoin and send it to unimaginable heights (50-100k in my opinion). After this occurs, pepole who are new to crypto will see that some altcoins go up faster than bitcoin does, until the FOMO from Bitcoin transfers to the FOMO of altcoins just like the end of 2017

[16-Jul-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> It is a very long cycle. Most people think the next Bitcoin FOMO cycle will happen from 2020-2021

[16-Jul-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> It is therefore highly likely that the Altcoin FOMO will happen near the end of the Bitcoin FOMO. So you can expect coins like Hush to skyrocket near the end of 2021 if the logirithmic charts play out like most think they will

[16-Jul-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> obviously, I could be totally wrong. But history repeats itself more often then most may think. It is about being prepared

[16-Jul-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> TL;DR as long as Bitcoin rallies, Coins like hush will suffer. However, once the momentum switches to Altcoins, you will be happy you are here reading this right now

[16-Jul-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> Many thanks @RunningMantheCoin

[16-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My focus is on increasing the price of Hush via making it useful, it's an "application coin", you use it do something, that is it's first reason to have value. Owning Hush = the ability to communicate privately, now and in the future. So you can also think of it as a "Store-of-Privacy". That is how it gets intrinsic value, in my mind. Speculation of future value is a secondary thing

[16-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And since it's has a very small total supply, if you use some privacy now, well you lesson your future store-of-privacy. Or you mine/buy more Hush. That is what gives Hush value. Privacy.

[16-Jul-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you value Privacy a lot, you probably will value Hush a lot. If you don't value Privacy, you won't value Hush.

[16-Jul-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> People who care most about Privacy will set the cost of Hush, because they will want to acquire it. They will dance with miners to find a middle ground of price

[16-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can tell you right now that a new wave of ASICs were just delivered, the A9++'s from Innosilicon. You can mine ZEC/ZEN/HUSH/KMD with them. And that is definitely related to our current price plunge. Miners are selling to cover their costs (which are many)

[16-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And that just feeds into the larger correction we are in

[16-Jul-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Until we hit the first Hush halving in ~500 days, we are in the golden ages of mining and buying Hush on the cheap

[16-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is my long-term view. I have no idea what the price of Hush will be between now and then, but the halving will very much change the price that miners will sell at. The price of ARRR changed drastically just after their recent halving

[16-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @RunningMantheCoin Agreed.
Looking at volume, the volume is just below 75000 hush the past 7 days(0.25BTC). Lot people are buying cheap and not selling. 
Look at the curve and orderbook you will see  less then 1 BTC to clean 98% orderbooks on all exchange. I know lot people whats to buy hush, but by doing so will raise the price by 3x, so they decide to buy low or mine it.

[16-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, I am just a coder, this is not financial advice

[16-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM i imagine many long-term investors are very happy to pick up cheap Hush right now. It's only when you do the opposite of the crowd that you make huge financial wins. Doing what everybody else is doing gets average results

[16-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We also plan to burn 160,000 HUSH

[16-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we haven't done all the marketing for it, but it will happen

[16-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The original devs did a pre-mine of 160,000 HUSH, and so current devs will burn the same amount to bring us into spiritual balance

[16-Jul-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Investors, savvy ones, will be intrigued by that, I think. BNB burns a lot of stuff, but they are not a PoW coin, so it's way less interesting that they do it

[16-Jul-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto Yep, as soon as the full communication stack is complete. I can bet bittrex(free) will list hush. Short term I feel we got enough exchanges and extremely decent exchanges.

[16-Jul-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We will be burning about 0.7% of TOTAL hush supply, or about 2.2% of current circulating Hush supply

[16-Jul-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Supply and demand dictates that this will make the remaining Hush more valuable, just like when somebody loses their BTC it makes all remaining BTC more valuable

[16-Jul-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
