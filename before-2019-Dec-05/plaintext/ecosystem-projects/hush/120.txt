[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @jl777c any thoughts on nash exchange.. will it be a contender and challenge binance total dorminance üòÄ

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is cross chain atomic swap or proxy token ?

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Its like a fully decentralised dex..

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Cross chain

[14-Jun-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> The matching engine is off chain..

[14-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> why does it have statechannel contracts holding the funds?

[14-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> that makes the contract a money transmitter according to fincen

[14-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i dont see where it says it is a cross chain atomic swap

[14-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> seems it will get tied up in regulations if it gets big enough

[14-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Now they are trying to clear all the regulatory hurdles and getting all the licenses

[14-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Thats why there is some delays

[14-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is NOT crosschain atomic swaps

[14-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> "During this time, user funds are never controlled by Nash. Users must sign off on the trades they send to the matching engine and are free to withdraw their funds from our trading smart contracts at any time, even if the matching engine and Nash web platform are not functional."

[14-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> funds are not controlled by nash, but also not controlled by the user. it is controlled by the smart contract

[14-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so you send funds to the contract

[14-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> trade

[14-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> withdraw funds from the contract

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the contract is the exchange

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is NOT crosschain atomic swaps

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and who controls the actual coins that are deposited in the contract?

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i guess you make wrapped coins and pay ETH fees for each action

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and who controls the gateways for that? the privkeys for the coins that are wrapped?

[14-Jun-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is a step up from proxy based DEX, but it is not anything like a cross chain atomic swap

[14-Jun-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes its control by the matching engine

[14-Jun-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> But the user interface is great

[14-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> They are partner with neo

[14-Jun-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Its "off chain"

[14-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the contracts are onchain, the coins must be held somewhere. who has those privkeys? is it multisig? it is automated?

[14-Jun-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> They use cryptography ie zero knowledge protocol .. user still control the private keys

[14-Jun-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> This is what the team member says "Essentially, you log into the exchange website with a username and password from¬†any computer¬†(+2FA), and you have access to the account. But it is still decentralized in that you control your account private keys, and NEX has no ability to use them. We do some cryptography magic to make this happen."
