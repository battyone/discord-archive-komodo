[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Bitcoin is high value

[16-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and so, protects itself

[16-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash, isn't and doesn't

[16-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nor does basically any other coin, unless they use sat/byte

[16-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Many things Zcash does are really fucking dumb, like completely ignoring me + Sapling woodchipper

[16-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But also, they don't even know if they can pay their server bills in 6 months, so they have bigger fires

[16-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No zcash protocol coin has every really seen a real spam attack, @jl777c do you agree?

[16-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> LTC + BCH + BSV get hit, or do it to themselves, but I haven't heard of a zcash family coin getting spam attacked

[16-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio there is some advanced game theory going on

[16-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> havent heard of any

[16-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio why show your hand and tell your enemies of a new kind of attack, instead of saving it for a more strategic time?

[16-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If anybody ever fucks with Hush, lulz

Deterrence theory
Deterrence theory is the idea that an inferior force, by virtue of the destructive power of the force's weapons, could deter a more powerful adversary, provided that this force could be protected against destruction by a surprise attack. This doctrine gained increased promine...

[16-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, I assume some people know Sapling Woodchipper comes from Hush world. If some people truly wanted to attack Hush, well Hush has some serious things to deter that

[16-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Like DoS'ing the entire world

[16-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio everything goes south real quick, basically global nuclear war = spam attacks

[16-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> God help you if I spam attack you, while 51% attacking you, while re-org attacking you, while diff-stall attacking you. God help you.

[16-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So yeah, hacking on cryptocoins is fun

[16-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio this has all been a thought experiment, aren't you glad everybody is happy and getting along? üòÉ

[16-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And this is why I like working on DPoW, we are the "good guys", protecting from attackers. We are the Blue Team and 51% attackers are the Red Team, for infosec people

[16-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Wow rly thanks! Very nice infos. I understand this much better now.

[16-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Nuklear war of crypto...i dont want to start this üòÖ

[16-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The only protection Hush and every other coin has, is make transactions more expensive

[16-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, if we put this warfare off, more people can use free/cheap xtns

[16-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If we fast forward, we go to the more expensive future

[16-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's going to be a lot of work to merge in code from Bitcoin to do sat/byte, no zcash coin has done it, but the Sapling Woodchipper basically says you must

[16-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We want to have the code ready, for the day spam attacks start

[16-Aug-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio if you see countries with their own coins, or depending on a coin, it's only a matter of time before a different country at war with them attacks that coin, as "infrastructure"

[16-Aug-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When country A attacks country B, they used to take out all the bridges, blow up all the electric stations, disable transit centers. Now you can add "disable internet communications" to that list

[16-Aug-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If North Korea was depending on ZEC to send encrypted memos, Uncle Sam wouldn't think twice, would it?

[16-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Because of fucking segwit, merging in sat/byte gonna be non-trivial

[16-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> isnt it just a miner change to order txid by sat/perbyte?

[16-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> until blocks are full, it really has no effect

[16-Aug-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c GUI wallets change a bunch, or at least need some changes

[16-Aug-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c and if I wanted to pull in code directly, the calculation of "virtual bytes" is tied to segwit

[16-Aug-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all the code which checks fees in an xtn changes

[16-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> just make the miners do a non-manipulated calc of txfee/rawtxsize

[16-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> can even use floating point as it is non-consensus

[16-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmmmm

[16-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c so you are saying it's much easier than I thought, sounds like

[16-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think it is just a matter to sort mempool by txfee/rawtxsize

[16-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> add to block until it is full

[16-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> seems a days work

[16-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i guess it wont artificially motivate people to use segwit, but it would create a fee market for blockspace

[16-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i am being enlightened

[16-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think I get what you are saying, and the most important code to implement sat/byte is purely in mining RPCs

[16-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and doing those mods, protects the chain, even tho all the work of GUI wallet fee-setting is not done yet

[16-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All the GUI crap can come later

[16-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i like this plan

[16-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c is this something you would want by default, so I can send to KMD upstream, or should this be some CLI option?

[16-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> seems it's best for miners, and should be default?

[16-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> seems a decent change to the miner, but i remember seeing it already did sorting by txfee

[16-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmmm, KMD might already have this stuff

[16-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think maybe alright/blackjoker worked on it

[16-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it was there since day 1

[16-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> fSortedByFee

[16-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but that doesn't take into account txsize

[16-Aug-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, if I understand, fSortedByFee is only part of it

[16-Aug-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i can just go read code now, and will come back with better questions, thanks üëç

[16-Aug-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> feeRate

[16-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> its there, though for KMD it would need to add in unclaimed rewards

[16-Aug-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i will get it to work for AC's with no interest  first, and leave interest for you üòâ

[16-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what i am saying is that i think it already mostly works for AC

[16-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if not totally works. so just need to verify

[16-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so miners will sort by fee/txsize already, but there are no user-visible knobs

[16-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes

[16-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If there is an active spam attack, GUI wallet users will not be able to easily deal with that, but can fiddle with various fee values to see what works. Better would be GUI wallet looks at last X blocks, and creates a "slow/medium/fast" option for users, to get stuff confirmed

[16-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash told all GUI wallet devs to remove the option to do a custom fee, thankfully most ignored them

[16-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Each GUI wallet does their own thing, and many might not allow setting a fee, but if attacks really start, they will evolve

[16-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sounds like we are in better shape than I thought

[16-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> just issue a settxfee from help console

[16-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @dukeleto is there a tutorial to make a basic wallet?

[16-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi can you be a bit more specific?

[16-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The above is a great article, that mentions Hush hashrate vs various coins

[16-Aug-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'd like to learn how to program a wallet.

[16-Aug-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'd like to find some tutorials for this.

[16-Aug-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This is for my own education.

[16-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi well, that means learning the programming language you want to code the wallet in

[16-Aug-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do you really need to learn the entire language

Not only is this a great tech write up, but it also studies the current hashrates of all Equihash (N=200,k=9) cryptocoins, which I haven't seen anywhere else. Diff stalling attacks are a solved problem now.
And it's already merged into $HUSH and will be in our next release...

[16-Aug-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi no, just enough. Nobody knows "all" of a language

[16-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> im bilingual. I never learned another language by just diving in

[16-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi in reality, you are going to find a wallet you want to modify, and "fork that"

[16-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and so, there is much less choice

[16-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You use what that thing uses

[16-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi if you want to fork SilentDragon (not a bad idea), you need to know C++ and QT

[16-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> QT is a gui library

[16-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which can be used from any language, but you will be using it from C++, C++14 to be exact

[16-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi if you instead wanted to fork Verus Agama, that is Javascript and nodeJS world, like Chinese vs Russian

[16-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So what you fork decides some things for you

[16-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And yes, you can start from scratch. But damn, who has the time for that?

[16-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And yes, writing from scratch will teach you the most, but it's not for everybody

[16-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I don't want to start from scratch

[16-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Good decision üôÇ

[16-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And C++ & QT sounds better

[16-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so, find a wallet you like, and fork it on github, is step 1

[16-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is also https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean
