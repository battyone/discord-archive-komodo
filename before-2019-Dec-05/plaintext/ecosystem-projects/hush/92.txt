[20-May-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Zcash is thinking of extending the founders reward.. which suppose to end nxt year.. not sure if thats good or bad ðŸ˜€

[20-May-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 pretty sure there will be rioting in the streets if that happens

[20-May-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 are you talking about something specific on their forums?

[20-May-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, the new Ycash fork is a direct response to that supposed event, Zcash going back on their promise and extending the FR

The future of Zcash in the year 2020
Iâ€™m going to start a new thread here to focus questions/thoughts about the future of Zcash.  Zcash is in a unique situation that has many questions that need to be answered in the next two years before the Founders Reward ends. This includes the question of what happens whe...

[20-May-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> The friendly fork ycash is also, opposing any extension of zcash founders reward

[20-May-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I think without any tax/funding.. many of their current "developers" may be layoff nxt year ..so naturally they are starting to get worried

[20-May-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, they were spending almost $1M USD/month thru a 1 year beark market

[20-May-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is pretty poor financial management

[20-May-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 i am looking thru the latest posts in that thread

[20-May-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes and nobody know what actually they spend it on

[20-May-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, Zcash has a company in Switzterland and the US, and a US foundation. They might be paying rent in 3 places, and I doubt it's cheap

[20-May-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they do not break down how they actually spend funds in the transparency report, true

[20-May-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It would be interesting to see how much goes to salary vs computers vs rent/etc

[20-May-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I started to write a new low-level RPC last night, z_createrawtransaction: https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/commit/1bcec40b97eed5085d69793f94697fbba80a22b0

Inspired by these aging issues, which have not been revisited since

[20-May-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it will allow a node to generate a shielded transaction, and then give it to another node to broadcast to the network

[20-May-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just like normal raw transactions work

[20-May-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this will help increase privacy of nodes, because you can give your xtn to a different node with a different IP

[20-May-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this can help privacy with or without Tor, because a passive network observer can no longer say "if i see a shielded xtn get submitted to the network from node A, then node A made the xtn", it breaks that assumption

[20-May-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is also really good for hardware wallet support of shielded transactions, because usually making, signing + sending an xtn crosses the boundary of the hardware wallet and the software on your computer that talks to it

[20-May-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, if you have a lot of funds, you can separate the computer which has all your funds from the internet entirely, and only allow it to make raw transactions

[20-May-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then use a QR code or something like that to put that transaction onto a computer with internet access, and that submits it to the network. Many whales probably do something like this for transparent addresses, but it's not possible with current tech on zaddrs

[20-May-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 still trying to read all of that zec forum post, gosh

[20-May-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
0.9%, meanwhile, or 2,033 ZEC per month, is going towards Zooko alone
Zooko can voluntary cut his share from 0.9% to 0.1% for example. (thatâ€™s as much as the 34 others get). Pretty sure he is compensated enough by Tezos and the other projects he works on.
3.4% of the total supply is going towards 34 employees
```

[20-May-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> pretty interesting that Zooko makes the same amount as 34 other zec employees, combined

[20-May-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe that is something to curb instead of extending the FR. It just seems like a money grab, to me, for them to extend it

[20-May-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> after so many promises over the years, it really would make their word worthless. Also, Zcash Foundation ferociously is against changing the FR

[20-May-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so if ECC does it, it will cause a schism

[20-May-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if they do it, it's free marketing for Ycash or whatever other new zcash forks bubble out of the chaos

[20-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Millions of dollars passed thru their hands, but they squandered it. Businesses like that should not stay in business

[20-May-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes it seems like they trying to over extend their retirement fund ..if they have it their way ..

[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so zooko was making over $1 mil a month during last bull market?

[20-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and they make a big deal of not paying radix42 $16,000 for doing their windows work

[21-May-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you mean "why isn't Barterlly listed on CMC?", that is a very good question. OTC platforms are not usually listed on sites like that

[21-May-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> additionally with Barterlly allowing cross chain swaps, like HUSH<>KMD, means that it has many more "pairs" (N^2 vs N) and tracking all those are not interesting to CMC+friends, at least not yet
