[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Screw the banks

[26-Oct-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> When you could get 125x leverage on stock futures, and the fed was just printing money, BTC didn't hold a candle.

[26-Oct-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> But we are very lucky and we can get in on HUSH and ARRR and front-run everyone else who is still learning about BTC (like taxicab drivers in Venezuela, etc)

[26-Oct-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> My hush went up again üò±

[26-Oct-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> .11$ but every penny count when you want to have a great retirement üòÇ

[26-Oct-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That is true, every penny counts

[26-Oct-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @1112 I think with HUSH we can definitely front run others

[26-Oct-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> Well those Penny's could be worth dollars by the time I'm ready to retire ü§û

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I really like HushList

[26-Oct-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> I spend more time here and have more hush then any other coin. Well other then my server and art servers.

[26-Oct-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That says a lot about the Hush Community

[26-Oct-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It's not toxic

[26-Oct-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Woody The Flipping Woodpecker> No not at all

[26-Oct-19 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> If a group, corporation, etc., wants to communicate securely in a decentralized manner on the blockchain, can't they just fork HUSH (since it's open-source) and do some small changes to airdrop every address 1 HUSH every hour, which will be enough to send all the necessary messages, then rent some hashing power in NiceHash and pay for the Komodo dPoW, and have a full solution for a few thousand dollars instead of paying us $1 for each hush in the future?

[26-Oct-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I see what your argument is, but I think the assumptions that you have are incorrect.

[26-Oct-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> JP Morgan runs Quorum, their enterprise version of Ethereum. And they dont use the Ethereum network, and they don't have to pay GAS

[26-Oct-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Let's say someone did fork Hush. How secure would their network be, if nobody was mining it?

[26-Oct-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Who would be constantly working to maintain the code?

[26-Oct-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> How secure would they actually be? Why not just anonymously use Hush, which is already up & running and secure?

[26-Oct-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Easier to let someone else do all of the work, and just use the product.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This article is interesting and scary

[26-Oct-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Seems like cool tech, hopefully being used for good. But I fear that people put too much trust into an "app" and run it on untrusted phones, amirite @Crypto99 ?

[26-Oct-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If anybody ever uses any android app for anything remotely like the above, have a dedicated phone for it. Do not install it on the same phone with lots of random apps and probably vendor-locked-in spyware üôÇ

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio my guess is that the json where the memo lives has a different key. Try to see if you can print the memo to STDOUT/STDERR

[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> hi - I found a hushd on my system and a blockchain going back a few months.
is this version totally outdated or can I use that to update my blockchain?
it does show a balance:
{
  "version": 2000050,
  "protocolversion": 170002,
  "walletversion": 60000,
  "balance": 7777.28153748,
  "blocks": 509820,

[26-Oct-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> as it says "version": 2000050, and HUSH3 is out this is prly obsolete- but can I still update my blockchani with it? it seems to be pulling blocks

[26-Oct-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @LocoMB that is the old hush blockchain. you can use the old wallet.dat in a new HUSH3 node to sweep funds, or if most of your funds are in a few addresses, it's easier to import those via the CLI

[26-Oct-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> :SD: has code to try to allow importing old HUSH keys, but something is messed up with it. It works via the CLI. If you DM me, I can help you

@dukeleto @murchandamus I'm not saying either chain is invalid.  I'm saying a majority of notaries could conspire with majority POW to double spend so there would be 2 different valid and notarized chains. A real fork.

If a notarization exists, ...
