[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> but a transfer from the old wallet to the new one

[18-Apr-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Dimi once our new web wallet comes online, i think the funds will just show up in your new-looking addresses. Your seed phrase will be exactly the same, but you will see that all your addresses start with R... now

[18-Apr-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 15220 addresses paid out now, down to paying out addresses with 1 HUSH or less

[18-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dimi> @dukeleto# ok. thanks

[18-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dimi> @Pepin the Healer# thanks

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> web wallet is partially working, looking at balances, receiving, but we are debugging issues with sending

[18-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many wheels are turning

[18-Apr-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dimi> @dukeleto# not working - https://wallet.myhush.org/

[18-Apr-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's not live

[18-Apr-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's in development, partially working

[18-Apr-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are not going to give you a partially-working web wallet, that is a really bad idea.

[18-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 16100 addresses paid out

[18-Apr-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> over 50% of addresses have been paid out!!!! Finally

[18-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are basically paying out to lots of change addresses now, < 1 HUSH

[18-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <juni> i have some hush in web wallet, how do i get airdrop

[18-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @juni you will automatically get the airdrop. Web wallet upgrade to hush3 is being finished right now. Just sit tight and we will let you know when you can sign in to see your balance in your new R address

[18-Apr-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 21200 addresses paid out, about 70% of addresses are paid

[18-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH v3 Windows binary (not a GUI wallet, but you don't have to compile a binary. Includes bat files to fetch params and start ): https://bootstrap.0x03.services/hush-binaries/ 🎉

[18-Apr-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> wget64 missing. Can you include the file so people don't download an incorrect version.

[18-Apr-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> so I have synched the HUSH blockchain with swing wallet- now I need to move my HUSH  coins from the seed based webwallet to a privkey based thing- I hope this will still be possible when the new webwalelt comes online?

[18-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> my seed phrase was able to access my coins a few days ago, so i went to syncheng the blockhain with swingwallet, but when that was finished, the webwallet was suspended again...

[18-Apr-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> and people that have hush in tradesatoshi? they receive the airdrop too?

[18-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> tradesatoshi did/will get tradesatoshi's airdrop, now if they hand them out or not is entirely up to tradesatoshi (it is tradesatoshi's coinage after all)

[18-Apr-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> understand 👌 .

[18-Apr-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 🎉 HUSH v3 airdrop is complete 🎉

[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> Hello, I have HUSH on Cryptopia, and  still cannot withdraw it . Do you have any recommendation?

[19-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Andrei Just wait, Cryptopia plans to support HUSH3, we are in talks with them. We don't have an exact time on when that will happen.

[19-Apr-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kaks> hi, i have hush address which start with T-address, how to get the airdrop?

[19-Apr-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kaks> i used agama mobile app address

[19-Apr-19 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> you don't have to do anything, just wait for new agama release and update

[19-Apr-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> Also, the word airdrop isn't accurate in this situation. It was a chain swap, not an airdrop - which usually means that both chains will go on..

[19-Apr-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @tedy yeah, words are hard. This is a coin or chain "swap", but the process of sending funds to the new chain is exactly like sending airdrop'ed coins. Sounds weird to say I am "running the swap" 😃

[19-Apr-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> no I know it's technically an airdrop (like every chain swap is) but in crypto dictionary it's called a "swap" if old chain is abandoned

[19-Apr-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> I've seen it many times transitioning from PoW to PoS where "devs" don't know how to hardfork and instead just start a new chain with PoS mining

[19-Apr-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> And they all call it swap 😄

[19-Apr-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Should someone be allowed to criticize the vernacular after using it half a dozen times themself?

[19-Apr-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> 🤔

[19-Apr-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> And where is this "crypto dictionary"?

[19-Apr-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _wants a copy_

[19-Apr-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> lol there probably isn't one, I'm just saying it gets less confusing for non-technical investors

[19-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> you mean the ones that you'll spend a lifetime trying to explain to how an assetchain isn't a token and they still will not get it?

[19-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> scroll up and you'll see people asking for airdrop not having coins in the first place

[19-Apr-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `An airdrop is a distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to a large number of wallet addresses.`
"usually" != "always"

[19-Apr-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> yes, those and even the less educated ones who we shouldn't make fun of since they're bringing the 💰 😄

[19-Apr-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> see, you actually found it

[19-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Send me an airdrop.

[19-Apr-19 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> Like Duke said, from a hodler’s perspective we are looking at a coin swap, not an airdrop. If you ever decide to declare your crypto and mention the word airdrop, you might be subject to CGT. With coin swap, you’re all good.

[19-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no idea what CGT is @Matthias

[19-Apr-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH3 is a "swap", the old chain is abandoned. The "airdrop" is what I called the process of dispersing funds on our new mainnet, that is the process of sending funds. But technically going from HUSH v2 to HUSH v3 is a "swap". HUSH v3 is not like BTCH, which truly was an "airdrop", not a swap

[19-Apr-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And to clarify, our ticker has always been and will always be HUSH. Our "asset chain name" in the KMD system is HUSH3, because various things already knew HUSH, such as the iguana code that makes notarizations knew that HUSH had t1 addresses but HUSH3 has R addresses...

[19-Apr-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @dukeleto  CGT means Capital Gains Tax on any profit made on investments...

[19-Apr-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I'm no accountant but I can't see how CGT would apply when the old chain has been "abandoned" and migrated over to use KMD as an upstream code base.

[19-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised @Matthias there is no CGT when given a fork coin or airdrop, I would make sure you both verify that before giving to your tax man. It depends which country you live, but it's when you go to fiat. Forks/airdrops fall under the law of when your cow gives birth in some place, no shit

[19-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, this is not financial advice.

[19-Apr-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised re-read your comment, yeah, i think we agree

[19-Apr-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> We are on the same page. 😉

[19-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> imagine paying CGT every time a new bitcoin fork comes out, and your privkeys unlock funds on some random new chain. it would be pure chaos.

[19-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your "basis" on the new coin starts when it gets airdropped/forked

[19-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Hard to make any profit from an abandoned blockchain. Would likely count as a capital loss if anyone could sell old Hush.

[19-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't pretend to follow laws about cryptocoins, I try, but mostly I stick to code

[19-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Will have to let all our accountants work that out when it comes to crypto and fiat profit or losses...

[19-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> please sir, where is capital loss form? I have so many Bitcoin shitforks that went belly up since my basis started

[19-Apr-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised so if one dumb exchange supports old Hush we can call it a huge loss?

[19-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all of these rules, they are just made up

[19-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> It'll be their loss if they do support old Hush. haha

[19-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Rules made up by thieves, if I might add

[19-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> can I say I have a capital loss of 21M old HUSH, since I invalidated that chain?

[19-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> None Of These Rules Make Sense

[19-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> The taxman is a thief, but one that can legally do so. 😉

[19-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i guess it was only about 6.1M circulating supply

[19-Apr-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yeah, i like to stick to code, because real-life can be weird a lot of the time. Bureaucrats and their paperwork, incessant paperwork

[19-Apr-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Taxman would only count Hush that was available at that time, not future...

[19-Apr-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Stick to code. It's more fun. I'd like to get back into it but there's only so many hours in a day.

[19-Apr-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool well actually they already do, via inflation. which should be the only tax used

[19-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> inflation tax would fund govt expenses and take from the economy via dilution, at exactly the same rate from everybody.

[19-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> likely this would be very objectionable to the rich who demand to be able to not pay taxes via loopholes and to the others who feel the poor are the ones that shouldnt pay anything

[19-Apr-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> still it removes all the gaming of the system that the rich do and even though the poor are hit equally as the rich, that is a far better outcome than now

[19-Apr-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> the guy getting a retroactive Customs bill for 27+% of every miner he purchased last year is wildly in favor of that idea
