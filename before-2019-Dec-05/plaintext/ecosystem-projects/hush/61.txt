[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> But my mining rewards for months was like 15 a day

[16-Apr-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Those Asics are on fire

[16-Apr-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> difficulty is very different right now

[16-Apr-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many pools are on the old chain, and paying out to miners on the old chain

[16-Apr-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and so the people on the new chain are reaping extra rewards

[16-Apr-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> And on Asics?

[16-Apr-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some asics may be pointed at the old chain too

[16-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but whoever is mining on the new chain, is earning more than they were before the new chain. because much lower difficulty, each person has higher % of network hashrate, nethash

[16-Apr-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it gets complex, but that is the high level

[16-Apr-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> less competition = more rewards per miner

[16-Apr-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I was talking to the trolls

[16-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh right, the trolls

[16-Apr-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I see Hush as a store-of-privacy, since 1 HUSH can be used to send thousands of secure private messages and also as a currency, because every message can also have financial value attached. That is the vision of Hush, to be the best store-of-privacy. The idea of storing future potential privacy in a private key, I find it fascinating and essential for the world we live in and much more so in the future that is coming.

[16-Apr-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and in our community we call these messages "memos" because they are powered by the Zcash protocol memo field, saved from the fires by the hands of radix42

[16-Apr-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this zombie developer of a ded coin just wrote a :carlos:  || 28147 line airdrop bash script || :carlos: , how about that for trolling?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A 2MB bash script, I am not sure if I have made such a unique creature before, it's a beautiful script that will migrate funds for ~31,000 addresses!

[16-Apr-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Doing something like this is not something to be rushed, or make mistakes, so I hope the community can appreciate that I am doing it as fast as I can, with taking all proper precautions

[16-Apr-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Radix is your friend?

[16-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> without radix42, the memo field may have been removed from the Zcash protocol, was my reference

[16-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, I keep in contact with radix42, she just made windows binaries for hush3 too, as a favor

The @MyHushTeam project just migrated to being a @KomodoPlatform asset chain in the last day or so, and although they haven't yet airdropped balances from the old chain yet, miners need to be able to generate addresses on Windows machines!

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, we are working on GUI wallet support as fast as we can

[16-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I was planning on mining to my Komodo address

[16-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Still debating on turning on my rigs

[16-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Agama Desktop + Mobile next releases will contain HUSH v3 support, and many other things are in motion

[16-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> DPoW is live!!!! That is huge

[16-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and at least 1 exchange is set to open once the airdrop completes, things are looking good

[16-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i might need a vacation after this airdrop

[16-Apr-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> 1.5 million hush worth of vacation?

[16-Apr-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Hahah

[16-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> @dukeleto checking your airdrop bash script it looks like immature blocks were not paid out to new chain. was that intentional?

[16-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @tedy what exactly do you mean by "immature blocks", do you mean "transactions in the mempool" i.e. "transactions with 0 confirmations" ?

[16-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> No

[16-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The snapshot is calculated from the output of the `getsnapshot` RPC command, and it only looks at things with at least 1 confirmation, transactions that are inside a block. The mempool is dropped, in any snapshot/airdrop, because it's not part of blockchain history yet

[16-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> immature block rewards

[16-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @tedy ok, you mean immature coinbase mining rewards

[16-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> immature block rewards don't show up with "getbalance" so i guess they didn't show up on getsnapshot?

[16-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is a good question, about edge cases

[16-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @tedy you running your own pool?

[16-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> yes

[16-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool you mined the next to last block, right?

[16-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> just before the last

[16-Apr-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I got block #499999

[16-Apr-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that address is in the snapshot, but it has lots of funds, so it's not clear if that xtn was included

[16-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> It is clear üòÉ

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> gimme a bit to get dressed and pull out my scripts

[16-Apr-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @tedy i am pretty sure immature coinbase is included, because they have >= confirmations

[16-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `getsnapshot` doesn't really look at maturity

[16-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> No, confirmations doesn't have anything to do with immature block rewards

[16-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool airdrop hasn't happen yet

[16-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> for example, if I check balance for 1+ confirmations, immature bloc krewards are not included

[16-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool but this is potentially the production airdrop script: https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/blob/duke/contrib/snapshot/airdrop_hush3.sh

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @tedy the RPC calls you are asking are not what getsnapshot uses

[16-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> getsnapshot talks to the low level LevelDB database directly

[16-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `airdrop hasn't happen yet` well, there's @tedy's answer üòõ

[16-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> I know but I'm assuming since none of my last 100 blocks were migrated

[16-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool I'm checking balance on airdrop bash script

[16-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so what you see for `getbalance` is not exactly the same logic as `getsnapshot` uses, it doesn't look at maturity as far as I know.

[16-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> Apparently it does.. it's not huge difference and i can live without it, just saying since I have noticed it and it's not fair for the last 100 block miners üòÉ

[16-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @tedy have you checked on the chain/explorer that the blocks you're looking for weren't orphaned?

[16-Apr-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> because it captured all of mine and I literally had the next to last block

[16-Apr-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> No it didn't.. just check it yourself

[16-Apr-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> You will get airdropped RXcc8yVSp3B7MssypLsQj64uBgc4dXUDYr\":4962.58235991

[16-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @tedy i am willing to look into this, because I was just about to do a testnet airdrop and prod airdrop, and I want everybody to be happy

[16-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> And your balance on old chain is: 4,987.58245991 HUSH

[16-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> looks like 2ish blocks were orhpaned maybe?

[16-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> No, he mined 2 of the ladt 100 blocks

[16-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tedy> I have mined 12 and none of them will be airdroped üòÉ

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Quote all datasources please

[16-Apr-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you are looking at balances of a legacy Hush wallet right now, it probably contains UTXOs from past block 500,000

[16-Apr-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> the last 3 blocks showing on explorer for me cover 82 blocks, so if it didn't cover 100 unconfirmed, then it would be off by more than the 25.0001

[16-Apr-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _will pull out his scripts and load his chain in  a bit and check where he's showing he's at_
