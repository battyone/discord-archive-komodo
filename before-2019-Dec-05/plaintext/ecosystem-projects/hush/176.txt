[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> :(

[04-Aug-19 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @AkiraX What?

[04-Aug-19 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I liked it

[04-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi that coin looks like it was at the bottom of the sea

[04-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> super old picture of me that was photoshopped, too. Kind of creepy

[04-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Okay. I was just trying to be funny.

[04-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I guess maybe this was the wrong room, to try to get a laugh

[04-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I see you enjoy memes & busting people's balls, cough cough ZCash... Figured u were good for a laugh.. Go back to being serious.

[04-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi hey, it was funny! I just also think it was a bit creepy, too ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @Privatoshi 15 hush

[04-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @Privatoshi 6 hush

[04-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @dukeleto sent @Privatoshi **6.00 HUSH** (â‰ˆ $0.26).

[04-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> keep the memes + images flowing folks

[04-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I need to top up my tip bot

[04-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi and you are right, I do enjoy dank memes and a good poke at Zcash ðŸ˜‰

[04-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some interesting talk going on here: https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/247

[04-Aug-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: Zcash and Hush don't quite see eye-to-eye on the future of memo field stuff, NO SURPRISE!

[04-Aug-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash is optimized for financial xtns, Hush is optimized for communicating. It makes sense

[04-Aug-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There are low-level things that will be designed differently, because of this divergence in design

[04-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash will only support 64KB memos, and so that means many low level changes from Hush, who will support 200KB or larger

[04-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> HUSH could support nSPV, whereas ZCash has little to no mobile presence

[04-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I know it is avoided for good reasons.
But people use cell phones, more than anything.
Would if instead of Signal, which has been doing some things that show a lack of respect for privacy, people use HUSH

[04-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has nSPV support already, we just haven't built it out yet. and nSPV is evolving very fast still

[04-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi yes, there will be a SilentDragon mobile app

[04-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we inherit one from Zecwallet, an android mobile app

[04-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it needs to be updated to allow HushList stuff, but we have all the important basics there

[04-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm talking about new privacy tech...
that works.. It seems like privacy has 
taken a few steps back, over past 3-4 years, in general

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Since Applebaum got banished

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh gosh

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you spake the name

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm just saying

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It was a shift

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi you seem to know some things

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I met Appelbaum in person a few times, he is a weird cat

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I didn't mean him being that important

[04-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> His incident left a lot of things up in the air

[04-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Guardian Project doesn't do much anymore

[04-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But HUSH is doing good

[04-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Any work is good work.
Things take time to put together

[04-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We really need our mobile app, I see that now

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That makes it "real" to a lot of people. Thing is, the mobile app needs to connect to your desktop

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's true freedom

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not using a 3rd party server

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Loki is trying

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Secure messenger

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> mobile app

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is the only way to make zaddr xtns with memo fields, via a server you trust with your coins

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e. your own

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's right

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And it's not free and from the Google Play Store

[04-Aug-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi i haven't heard about Loki in a while, i talked to some of their devs a long time ago

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> XMR coins don't have a memo field, so I have no idea how Loki works

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I don't trust anything from the Play Store

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's based on Monero/CryptoNote, yes?

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yes

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Probably Ring CT

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi that is reasonable, we can provide an .apk via github, lol ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> FDroid

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most people don't know how to use .apk's ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I disassemble apks

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> on my phone lol

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whoa

[04-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you are above my paygrade on mobile stuff, I just make full nodes work

[04-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Easy

[04-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Dexplorer apk

[04-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You are a lot more intelligent than I am

[04-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You should always recognize quality when it's there

[04-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You do good work.

[04-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's not glamorous, but oh well...

[04-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi we plan to get SilentDragon on TAILS

[04-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or at least try

[04-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think if we submit the PR, they will accept

[04-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now imagine, Hush doesn't need all those dumb sprout files (1.6gb)

[04-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those files make using Tor basically not an option

[04-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but if you don't have to download all those files.... Tor is a much better option

[04-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush basically is the best Zcash protocol coin to use via Tor, because we have the tiniest bandwidth requirements to start a full node

[04-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Nobody else is even close

[04-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have not marketed this very well

[04-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For those following along at home, TAILS is an OS that forces the use of Tor and disallows any networking which doesn't use Tor. basically the safest way to use Tor: https://tails.boum.org/

[04-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Sprout files are bs

[04-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Tails is as user friendly as it gets

[04-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi do you actively use TAILS?

[04-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need some users that actually use it, to test things. I am a developer, my brain is broken by knowing how the code works

[04-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can't test things like a real user

[04-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Tails is like to tor what ChromeOS is to Chromebook

[04-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I can test

[04-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
