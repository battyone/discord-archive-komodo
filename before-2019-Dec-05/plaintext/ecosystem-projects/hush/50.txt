[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I imagine they'll do whatever makes them the most profit

[31-Mar-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I recommend using agama

[31-Mar-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jb123456789> yeah but can i sell it for btc on it

[31-Mar-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> but why though?

[31-Mar-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jb123456789> ?

[31-Mar-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> why sell at the bottom?

[31-Mar-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jb123456789> cause id rather have other coin at the moment

[31-Mar-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Mar-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Are you mining with an asic?

[31-Mar-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jb123456789 mining to exchanges is very rarely a good idea, I might even say never

[31-Mar-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> NOTE: Everyone who has funds on Cryptopia will be part of the snapshot to the new chain, since they are all transparent addresses. You don't need to do anything

[31-Mar-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> Are we gonna get airdrop after a snapshot?

[31-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's more like a "swap", your get coins on a new network, a new mainnet. We are mining a new genesis block and your private keys unlock the same amount of coins on the new network

[31-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FYI your addresses will change, I am writing more to explain that

[31-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: t1.... addrs become R... addrs

[31-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @dukeleto key model still the same, though, right? just a straight import?

[31-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, just converting the normal pubkey to a KMD address

[31-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you know how to import pubkeys with KMD tools, you can do the normal thing

[31-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> any ZEC WIF tools will work with HUSH

[31-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> sweet, then I don't have to do anything üòÑ

[31-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have the exact same prefixes as ZEC on the old Hush chain

[31-Mar-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> Holding in my Hush swing wallet 0.72.2 V2 is ok then for snapshot?

[31-Mar-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Papa D yes if your funds are on transparent adress (starting with t1)

[31-Mar-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> Very good! They are. Just wanted to make sure that they didnt need to be transferred to Agama.

[31-Mar-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Papa D No need.

[31-Mar-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> üëçüèº

[01-Apr-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Is cryptopia trading hush again?

[01-Apr-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Where can I buy it

[01-Apr-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X most exchanges are paused right now. You could mine some with a z9 mini (which are very cheap now) or use Nicehash to mine some to your address

[01-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I haven't looked at nh prices today, but (based on yesterday's insanity) unless the diff is really low I wouldn't suggest a rental for non-holders

[01-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool define "yesterday's insanity" (mostly because i have been living under a rock called "real life")

[01-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I looked at the btc mempool and it looked like some 1sat utxo spam event or something

[01-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> BTC hit $4100 and the price of rentals per hash went **up** üòï

[01-Apr-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> it cost more to rent *and* the BTC was worth more, which means the increase was exponential

[01-Apr-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> all things being equal, when BTC goes up or down, the cost should be an inverse

[01-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> glad I always say "this isn't financial advice" üòÖ

[01-Apr-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> z9 mini's are getting crazy crazy cheap, because yes, they will not be useful at all for mining ZEC very soon

[01-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but they will be quite nice+cheap to mine various things that people are not mining much right now, like HUSH

[01-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's just a crazy cheap entry point

[01-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not efficient, as CG will likely tell you üòÉ

[01-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I'm still banking with 1080Tis and S7s, so I dunno where ppl always get this "not profitable" thing from ü§∑üèΩ

[01-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> people are selling z9m's with bitmain PSU for under $200. Just the PSU is $95 new on amz prime

[01-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> "not **highly** profitable" maybe üòï

[01-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have cheap electricity, a cheap z9m for $200 is a very nice entry to ASIC mining

[01-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you pay a lot, probably not worth it

[01-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if you run enough of anything, you'll make $ with it üòõ

[01-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> otherwise, get a used A9 on ebay, they are getting cheap too

[01-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i plan to make a myhush.org/mining/ page, to describe all the diff HW to mine HUSH with

[01-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have z9 mini, z9, a9, a9+ and z11 now

[01-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe others?

[01-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> A9++

[01-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> may/june

[01-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> IF Hush price changes drastically from being relisted, we are going to see massive difficulty spikes on Hush

[01-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> right now, whattomine.com doesn't show Hush because we are paused and have 0 trading volume

[01-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a lot of things might change once exchanges re-open, then miners will be able to use calculators for Hush again

[01-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a lot changes

[01-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> well, chances are the diff will spike on move anyway (some folks just like to mine all assetcahins anyway)

[01-Apr-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think that we will get picked up by various KMD mining pools as well

[01-Apr-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> while a few Hush pools might not transition, but they are ones with very small hashrates and might not make sense for them

[01-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> for code reasons it'll be a bit before it's added to üêî 
I would have rather added it than create minehush, but I haven't figured out how to have more than 24 hrs in 1 day yet ‚òπ

[01-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have set various bounties to encourage mining pools to transition, and also additional bounties for paying out to shielded addresses. I hope this increases the privacy of our entire community, by encouraging miners to be paid out to shielded addresses

[01-Apr-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool i totally get it

[01-Apr-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> make it work first, then make the code pretty later

[01-Apr-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `and also additional bounties for paying out to shielded addresses.`
There will be a solo that does that, shortly behind the transition üòâ

[01-Apr-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I still need to find a good frontend dev though ‚òπ

[01-Apr-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spartacus> was gonna reply, but you said 'good'

[01-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> there's no part of me that isn't exhausted by still using the same old NOMP pages

[01-Apr-19 01:42 PM] EC#3791
What is a good exchange to sell HUSH?

[01-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Barterlly will support Hush and will open soon, keep an eye on it: https://twitter.com/barterlly

[01-Apr-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH, to my knowledge, will be the very first coin to have a pure Sapling-only chain. We are the first!

[01-Apr-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i wasn't really sure, but it's the case. We start with Sapling from block 1, no Sprout technical debt üéâ

[01-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and we will have a tiny tiny blockchain of a few megabytes at first, super super fast to sync a full node!!! This is good to get lots of people using full node wallets, before our blockchain is big and bulky

[01-Apr-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is SUPER IMPORTANT, because of things like this: https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-03-19/

Security Announcement 2019-03-19 - Zcash
Synopsis: A bug in the Zcashd wallet could result in Sprout z-addresses displaying an incorrect balance. Sapling z-addresses are not ‚Ä¶

[01-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That bug means that an attacker could make your node THINK (print out) that they sent you more funds than they actually did, but if you tried to spend them it would fail. It's a pretty bad bug in Sprout

[01-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sprout was not designed well and we will be so lucky to rid ourselves of it completely, very soon

[01-Apr-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Nice, i'm looking forward to using the new chain and get a full node going :hush_white:

[01-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> @dukeleto I had the opposite bug happen...I sent funds from my shielded address to a t-addr,  and the wallet thought I still had the z-addr funds...but wouldn't let me spend them again.. üòÇ

[01-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> `-rescan`  of course fixed it, but yeah...pain in ....

[02-Apr-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> the sprout bug is patched, but I think it still has sprout functionality
