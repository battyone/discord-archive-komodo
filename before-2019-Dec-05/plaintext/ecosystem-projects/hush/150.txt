[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> With HUSH about to start using (or already using) dPOW, does that mean HUSH messages/contacts will be backed up on Bitcoin?

[14-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Hush does indeed use dPoW already it has for months now üôÇ

[14-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> great, so r messages/contacts backed up on BTC?

[14-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I don't think it quite works that way, iirc every block is notarized with a transaction to the kmd chain and those are then notarized from kmd to btc

[14-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> There's loads documentation online on how it works.

[14-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @gigamesh  are you involved outside of communities other than pirate?

[14-Jul-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @AkiraX i usually get involved in the communities as i write about  them. sometimes i stick around after, often if i end up grabbing a bag. im prob mostly involved in NKN atm. actually this writing gig started with NKN

[14-Jul-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Im writing a review of HUSH at the moment,  getting all the pieces together. funnily enough i had no idea Mercer had been  involved in HUSH (i recently published a short interview with her)

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> but it has some old info

[14-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @gigamesh  is your site widely followed?

[14-Jul-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh not quite "backed up on BTC". The proof that they happened is backed up onto BTC. DPoW essentially tells BTC about transactions on another chain, to protect against 51% attacks.

[14-Jul-19 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Proof something happened is not the same as a backup of the actual data. Bitcoin is very strict about the data you put it, you can only put in a few bytes. So you put in proofs that things happened, not the actual things

[14-Jul-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "Proofs" are usually related to hash functions of things, because knowing the SHA256() of something is basically exactly the same as proving you knew the original thing. You will see security people sometimes publish a sha hash on Twitter, which is the hash of a statement. They are proving they said something publicly, at a certain time. People will be able to do something exactly like that with SilentDragon soon enough. And with Hush, you can put small amounts of data, or links to external sources for large datasets (bittorrent already exists, don't re-invent that wheel)

[14-Jul-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and to explain, later on, the security people will show the plaintext statement of the hash they published in  tweet. Sometimes related to embargoed CVEs and other fun stuff

[14-Jul-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i wonder if you could use the same type of math to prove God exists.

[14-Jul-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh to explain about the WP, it's written in LaTeX, as Knuth intended, so it has a build system üòÉ

[14-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh Hush was the first Zcash protocol coin to enable DPoW, it was a while ago, maybe over a year. We use that on top of the standard Equihash (200,9) (same as ZEC/ZEN/KMD), so we support all the same ASIC hw as those coins as well

[14-Jul-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I wrote the code for Hush+dpow over a year ago, I think it went into production many months later, so it depends how you measure

[14-Jul-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> So the shielded memo will eventually be 4mb? Also, can HUSH also have the ability for whistleblowers to post a file anonymously yet have to file contents public?   So only shield the parties, and not the file data?

[14-Jul-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq memos will always be 512 bytes in zcash protocol, and transactions can be up to 200KB in size, which means if we want to store a 4MB file, we use multiple transactions (and pay multiple transaction fees)

[14-Jul-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All komodo asset chains currently enforce a limit of 200KB for max xtn size and 4MB for max block size, Hush could decide to change that in the future, if we want, but those numbers are chosen very carefully
