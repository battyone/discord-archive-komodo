[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> basically will drain the battery instantly

[10-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is why you have SilentDragonAndroid paired to a full node, better use of resources

[10-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi you seem to know a lot about FVEY, only more evidence against you ðŸ‘¼ ðŸ‘¹

[10-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi tell me more about nethunter

[10-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Nethunter is Kali mobile

[10-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> lol

[10-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ah, ok. sounds interesting

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> well well well

[10-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm one resourceful s.o.b

[10-Sep-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think I covered all Android security / privacy..
Not much left to find

[10-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi interesting

[10-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We can get listed on there too

[10-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so they have their own custom F-Droid store, essentially

[10-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very cool

[10-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so we can have SilentDragonAndroid listed there?

[10-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yeah below that SS it says do u want to be listed

[10-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> coolsies

[10-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'd do that just for awareness

[10-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe they'll put it in the main OS

[10-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why not?

[10-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> zaddrs

[10-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No leaks

[10-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Only other safe crypto wallet is samurai

[10-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Google Play made them remove the privacy tech

[10-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And they obliged

[10-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is the only zcash coin that doesn't need 1.6GB of downloads

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and we have basically the smallest blockchain as well, of all sapling chains

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why can't a full node run on mobile, again?

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> battery

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just kills the battery

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The battery

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have free bandwidth and huge disk, your battery is just not going to survive

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> works fine if it was plugged in

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe on a tablet

[10-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what about SilentDragon for Android Tablets?

[10-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why not limit the bandwidth and only give it â…› battery core

[10-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> could be a thing

[10-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Make it think it's using the whole battery

[10-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But it only gets 1/8th

[10-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you don't stay in sync, you will never be in sync

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so you won't be able to make transactions

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I se

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> zcash on mobile S10 can only process 30 hash per second on 100%. 1/8th will be only 4 hash per second

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Damn

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM are you talking about mining or validating transactions?

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> validating

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, zaddr xtns are expensive to validate

[10-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sapling are much better, Sprout ones are very heavy

[10-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the entire beginning of ARRR is all Sprout joinsplits

[10-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> yes, was getting there. takes 3 seconds to process sapling

[10-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think a small pocket raspberry, carrying in your shirt pocket is the best possible

[10-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so to sync ARRR, it's very CPU intensive in the beginning

[10-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then when Sapling enables, it's faster

[10-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM oh, you are talking about *creating* zxtns. Yes, those are also faster

[10-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every time your node processes a block, it must validate every xtn in it

[10-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The zec (hush) tech fascinates me...

[10-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and all the zxtns will be "heavy", much more CPU to validate than a taddr xtn

[10-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why is that? Why can't it select a random one and if it is correct, move on

[10-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> All of them is heavy

[10-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every single bit of data must be validated, or you don't know if it's valid

[10-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that means every block and every transaction

[10-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every full node does this, like Bitcoin

[10-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What am I thinking

[10-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's possible to "prune" a full node

[10-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think I'll carry a raspberry pi

[10-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> in my pocket

[10-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Better than Signal Â© lol

[10-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and delete most of the blockchain data, but some bugs need to be worked out to get that working nicely with DPoW

[10-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `-prune` mode

[10-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> SDPoW = Ethereum 2.0

[10-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Super Delayed

[10-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> ARRR to sync on a mobile: 535663 -> 1400+ hours or 60 days. 100%, will burn out your device within 5 days

[10-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Whattttttttt

[10-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Moto G4 could do it plugged in

[10-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I had one stay on for 8 months in my dressrr
