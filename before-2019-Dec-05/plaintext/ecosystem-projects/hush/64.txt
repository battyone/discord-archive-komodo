[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> I am trying to access my funds on the mobile agama wallet, is the update affecting the ability to do so, as it is telling me it can‚Äôt connect?

[16-Apr-19 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Hammerstein Agama Desktop + Mobile next releases will contain HUSH v3, in lite mode

[16-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I'm only 1/2 joking, I'm not sure I'll ever understand why so many people keep the majority of their crypto in those banks

[16-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> I have it in my wallet but If you want to trading you need to withdrawal

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> and cryptopia frozen de withdrawals

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if it's in your wallet, then you can do whatever with it whenever you want

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> cryptopia can't freeze your wallet

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> yes

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> no

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> frozen the withdrawals

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> If you don't hold the private key, it's not yours

[16-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> they hold the key, it's their wallet

[16-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> I know

[16-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> but if you want to sell trading or what ever else

[16-Apr-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> you need to send your coins to exchange

[16-Apr-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> never sell/trade more on a bank than you're willing to lose

[16-Apr-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> OK guy

[16-Apr-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> CEXs are banks

[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> üëè

[16-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> you will send your coins to exchange that have more volume

[16-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> if I send to one exchange that have 0 usd in 24hrs??

[16-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> no bank has ever held more than 10% of any coin I value unless I'm dumping to buy equipment

[16-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> you are saying some stupid things

[16-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Not really

[16-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i haven't been able to keep track of backlog, looks like lots of fun going on

[16-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> if you want to send to dex or exchange is our decision

[16-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `we are freedom of sending`
yes, you can freely send whatever is yours whenever you like
The bank can freely stop you from withdrawing what is theirs whenevre they like

[16-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If your money is in a CEX it's just a line on a spreadsheet, if you don't control the private key, you don't necessarily own the funds. Always transfer to a self-owned wallet after transacting on an exchange.

It amazes me daily how many people do not understand that fact

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not yo private keys, not yo coins

[16-Apr-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @admon i might have missed something, is there a specific question you have about the airdrop of hushv3 ?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i try to stick on the code

[16-Apr-19 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> OK thanks

[16-Apr-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptopia tells us they intend to support HUSH v3, we are working with them and conversing back and forth. Since we just now have a genesis block and mainnet, they can actually do things on their end. Before it was just vague planning

[16-Apr-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am going to write details in the whitepaper about all this as well, i paused on updating the whitepaper to do the airdrop
