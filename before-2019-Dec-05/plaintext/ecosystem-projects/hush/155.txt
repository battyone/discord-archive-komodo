One way to track paradigm shifts (read: not ephermeral trends) is to look at Google Books' Ngram viewer for your topic of interest. In this case, privacy.

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> also, if you explained the level of shit people post about themselves on the current internet to someone from 1950 they'd likely call you a liar or ask "Why would people ever even consider doing that?"

[18-Jul-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Lots of allegations about Cryptopia there, not sure what is true

[18-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Personal privacy between individuals was assumed. However they didnt have to encounter personal privacy & corporations. They assumed if the govt needed to know it, then they obsiousky need it.

[18-Jul-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> With or without article, boys weren't businessman. Cryptopia crash was inevitable, they had too many employees for their income. Business model with about 1000 coins and low volume was allways risky. It takes too many support employees for every coin with 0 volume. Crash just happened much sooner than expected and shady way. Hack(s) with internal help? That seems possible/probable from the very begining...

[18-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> That's weird. I always thought of Cryptopia as understaffed.

[18-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Because of their support times

[18-Jul-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> At times they reportedly had over 70 employees in support.

[18-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Omg

[18-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> They had their NEO wallet offline for several months.

[18-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Took me 2 months to get NEO. I lost about 70% of value.

[18-Jul-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Remember that volume was fairly low. Probably they made the majority of their income with listing fees. You can't handle your coins, but you're still accepting new. Like a Ponzi...

[18-Jul-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I bought Hush on there. I have no story about losing many. But I did find it trading on there.

[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Didn't Cryptopia sell everything to some guy in Arizona & all of the hard drives were lost, or some bs?

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I agree, if not for Cryptopia, many of us would not found HUSH, KMD and many other alts.

[18-Jul-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Liquidator seized back data, but $ price is not mentioned. Server owners were reportedly asking for 2 or 2.5 M$ I think.

[18-Jul-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But I would be very surprised if liquidators payed that many. Maybe 1/4 of a price...

[18-Jul-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Such bullshit

[18-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> But it's the past

[18-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It looks like Hush is really starting off well

[18-Jul-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cruz X (10) HUSH is compatible with all the new atomicdex stuff, tho I am not sure they have enabled all the coins yet. Probably testing on a small subset of coins

[18-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @dukeleto I'm more curious about Hush messages and Hush lists.

[18-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> What is your take on being able to build a wallet, an app, on Android, where these two features would probably be received very wellm

[18-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cruz X (10) if you are willing to pair your phone with your laptop/desktop/server, and let it do some stuff, then the tech basically already exists and needs to be glued together. But pure-mobile shielded transactions with memo fields don't currently exist and nobody is working on it. Zcash shielded mobile transactions do not have memo fields

[18-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is why I am not much interested in all the latest shielded mobile stuff from Zcash. None of it has memo fields, for privacy reasons. Asking for memo field data to a 3rd party server tells that server which transactions you care about, it's a privacy thing. Light wallets and shielded transactions are very different, and it's amazing you can do light shielded transactions at all

[18-Jul-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I get it. Being able to do light shielded txs is impressive.

[18-Jul-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> What type of OS/architecture would need to exist, on mobile, to maintain privacy? Does it exist?

[18-Jul-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> im quite impressed with the conversation going on in the discord lately.  im learning alot

[18-Jul-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It helps when you have experienced and knowledgeable people, that will come in here & talk.

[18-Jul-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It's nice to have that option

[18-Jul-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> _____
Is it important to be on a lot of exchanges?

[18-Jul-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cruz X (10) there are fundamental issues with giving up privacy and using a 3rd party server for shielded transactions. Supporting memo fields tells the server which transactions you are interested in and that ruins stuff, so Zcash decided to just not support the memo field and move forward like that

[18-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cruz X (10) very long github issue describing things here: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3638

[18-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Light wallet shielded transactions can be thought of as a "Zcash Lite" protocol, because it does not include some very important things in the full Zcash Protocol, most importantly the memo field.

[18-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It greatly reduces bandwidth needs too, as every memo field is 512 bytes

[19-Jul-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Lol well IMO it's never acceptable to trade off privacy, for convenience.

[19-Jul-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Even if it's just to satisfy a group of individuals.
Because it becomes easier for you to expose information.

[19-Jul-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> @Seymour webwallet and use priv key and send to HuShMate

[19-Jul-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Seymour> @aledel And if I only have wallet.dat?

[19-Jul-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `And if I only have wallet.dat?`
run the new gui/daemon with `-zapwallettxes`, the wallet.dat in the proper place for the new chain, and it should right itself

[19-Jul-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and of course, SilentDragon is recommended on Linux/Unix as well, but you need to compile

[19-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `-zapwallettxes` is actually a feature of BTC

[19-Jul-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763

the way to do it is run hushd manually first

[19-Jul-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Seymour you can also use private key method. Simplest thing is to use Verus Agama WIF2WIF tool, convert old private key of HUSH to new style, then import that private key to either HUSHmate or SilentDragon

[19-Jul-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Seymour nothing is time-based, so you can wait to any time to do this stuff

[19-Jul-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have hundreds of addresses, that might suck. If you have a handful, it should work fine

[19-Jul-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon is learning how to convert old private keys to new, that should be in the next release of SD

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh sending of memos back and forth 1-to-1 with replies or anon currently works in SilentDragon. That is "chat". Mailing lists (1-to-many) is not implemented and file upload stuff I have began working on in the `upload` branch.
