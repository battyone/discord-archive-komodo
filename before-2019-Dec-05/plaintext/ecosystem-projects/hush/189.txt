[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> their use cases are not the average use cases

[13-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Is HUSH open source?

[13-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ALSO, I don't disagree with you, if they could backdoor something and benefit, of course they will try

[13-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How can they without hash power?

[13-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq yes

[13-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX every CPU can mine, why don't they have hashpower?

[13-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> More hash required?

[13-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All they need is one CPU miner to make a private chain go

[13-Aug-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> If they did that, HUSH would become very valuable as it would be considered "govt grade" tech by common investors/people

[13-Aug-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Mining it right now could be extremely beneficial

[13-Aug-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How would you know if they have cloned it?

[13-Aug-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH is defined as a digital weapon, just like Zcash and all other Zcash protocol coins

[13-Aug-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because encryption

[13-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX there is no good way to prove they have or have not. But it's 99% likely üòÉ

[13-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> that would not hold up in court i don't believe

[13-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq "digital weapon" ? It's a very well-defined thing in the US

[13-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's something the US gov gets really angry about

[13-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> There is nothing malicious in the software.

[13-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq I know it must be surprising to you, because I assume you are not a US citizen, but Hush+Zcash fall under ITAR: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations

[13-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush and Zcash are, by the definition of internation law, military grade digital weapons

[13-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> what?! lol

[13-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ya buddy

[13-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Impressive. üòâ

[13-Aug-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Oh, i'm in Chandler

[13-Aug-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I cannot legally give Hush to a citizen of Iran or various other countries, since they are on a special list. Github now enforces this. Mostly they care about binaries, but it applies to source code too

[13-Aug-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Github enforces it at a higher level, not letting those countries access Github at all

[13-Aug-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Right, the recent purchase of Github

[13-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So yeah, cryptocoin devs need to know about various laws that seemingly have no relation to them

[13-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Bitcoin is not a digital weapon. It has no encryption

[13-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> How about..............................HUSHhub.

[13-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Only Zcash and children

[13-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Even XMR, I think it's not a digital weapon. No encryption

[13-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So yeah, the definition is really weird

[13-Aug-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I try to do my best to know the laws but they constantly change and depend on your GPS coordinates

[13-Aug-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD + Pirate are also digital weapons

[13-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Strange.  Zcash is being allowed to live though?

[13-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because they are zcash source code forks

[13-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq Uncle Sam sure does love Zcash mainnet

[13-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gives me the creeps

[13-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Every KMD asset chain is a digital weapon, even if they turn zaddrs off

[13-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Because the law doesn't care that you turned the feature off, it's still has all that code inside and is still a Zcash derivative

[13-Aug-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> There needs to be enterprise on these chains

[13-Aug-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Have you ever thought about using it as a tool for liquidity

[14-Aug-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't understand the question

[14-Aug-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Use  portiom Hush funds to trade and grow liquidity by trading in and out of hush?

[14-Aug-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And other coins

[14-Aug-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> @AkiraX you mean creating fake volume??

[14-Aug-19 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> not really, can actually put liquidity on exchanges like cratex, altilly and bartelly.
Add 100 sats difference , when sold it can rebuy on other exchanges.

[14-Aug-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> Ah, so more like arbitraging.

[14-Aug-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Wouldn't say it's fake volume if you're selling/buying actual mined/minted coins from the blockchain. Fake volume is generated only on the exchange by the exchange owner/operator.  BiteBTC/now fedlio.com is one such (scam) exchange that does this.

[14-Aug-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
