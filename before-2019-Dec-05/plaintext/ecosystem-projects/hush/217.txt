[10-Sep-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Having to use them for parts

[10-Sep-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Google gave me a free Android when they first came out, they gave them to everybody that came to the Git Together 2009 conf (core git dev conf)

[10-Sep-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they hooked me good

[10-Sep-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Everybody got a free one, but mine was DOA

[10-Sep-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so he personally walked me to Chris DiBona's office

[10-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> classy guys

[10-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there were 300 more important git devs than me, there

[10-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Google runs a second profile

[10-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> my S5 has encrypted GSM calls

[10-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I got to meet the head of Android dev, at the time

[10-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Rubin?

[10-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he used git in such a crazy way that Google wanted Git to change

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Rubin made the Essential Phone

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Google-ites

[10-Sep-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Gerrit is what Google-flavored Git is

[10-Sep-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Android uses Gerrit to manage development

[10-Sep-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Think of Gerrit as Git with a suit and tie and a fleet of jets

[10-Sep-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763

Bigwigs?

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bigwigs don't use tech lol

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Big companies don't put their shit on Github publicly

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they do that last

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it all happens internally first, most of the time

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then is pushed out to github

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Google Dorks

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I have a GitHub osint app

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Gerrit allows you to say "make sure that 2 lawyers and 3 devs agree this code is ok to be sent to production"

[10-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It tears GitHub apart lol

[10-Sep-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so much osint on github

[10-Sep-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> So Duke, what is preventing an Android from running a full node?

[10-Sep-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'll write u some instructions.
You should take your Nexus 5 and add Nethunter

[10-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi probably not much, except that it would require F-Droid, not sure Google Play would accept it

[10-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for a BTC full node, it's mostly disk space (300GB or more)

[10-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but Hush is <900MB currently

[10-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> full nodes use a lot of bandwidth and power, for a phone
