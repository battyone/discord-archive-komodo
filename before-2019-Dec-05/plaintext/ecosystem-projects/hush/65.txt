[dscrd-hush] <juni> ?

[17-Apr-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @juni what is your question?

[17-Apr-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM airdrop works on addresses, not wallets, so most likely you have some addresses with smaller amounts of HUSH, that haven't been sent out yet

[17-Apr-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <psimondo (ginturk)> Can we pin this on announcements... you might want to see your new address https://dexstats.info/addressconverter.php

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Command line junkies can convert old HUSH `t1` addresses to new HUSH3 `R` addresses with this tool I wrote: https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/blob/duke/contrib/convert_address.py

[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> @dukeleto  The private key is the same tho, correct?  Or no?

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @blankmac - BasementPool no, the public and private keys have different base58 prefixes, so they look different, but they are the same key, encoded differently

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @blankmac - BasementPool KMD Agama GUI wallet has a "WIF to WIF" tool in the "Tools" menu

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it can translate WIFs between coins

[17-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Ah, I see, so I can translate the private key with your script?  Or another tool?  Just trying to understand how to import my old address balances.

[17-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> current agama only knows about old hush, so if you use an existing agama, you would say "convert this HUSH WIF to this KMD WIF"

[17-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my script only converts addresses

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is a script to convert wifs too, the Agama GUI is probably easier to use

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Current HUSH3 WIF format, as an asset chain, is KMD format, like every other asset chain

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD and all asset chains use the same base58 prefixes for addresses (normal and scripthash), public keys, and private keys

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH old format was exactly the same as ZEC. With the above information, it's possible to use existing tools or write new ones to do it, but it needs to be made easier

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are working on that

[17-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> another simple thing, is to backup your wallet.dat

[17-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then use an old HUSH wallet.dat on a new HUSH3 full node, with the `-zapwallettxes` CLI arg, which should allow you to claim funds. Obviously we need to test this more and it's only for people comfortable with the CLI

[17-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> various exchanges and pools have been doing things like this, to get operational

[17-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Because all BTC forks share the same math curve, they have the same public + private keys, so your wallet.dat unlocks equivalent addresses on any chain

[17-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Ok, my skull is thick but I think it got through...lol.   So I can use the KMD agama wallet to translate the old hush priv key and then use that to import to the full node?

[17-Apr-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes

[17-Apr-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "Tools" menu of KMD agama desktop wallet

[17-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> has many things, one is "Wif to Wif"

[17-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> WIF=Wallet Import Format

[17-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is base58 of a privatey key, which some prefixes

[17-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> never give a WIF to anybody! You should never give it to a website!

[17-Apr-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Only because you trust the wallet running on your computer, and it has access to all your funds already, is why putting in a WIF is ok. It's a completely local operation

[17-Apr-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You only should ever use a WIF yourself, never give it to others, is what I am trying to say

[17-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Gotcha, I'm clear on the security aspects of the private key.   I do some hardware programming as a hobby so I'm not completely out to lunch, but admittedly, my knowledge of the nuts and bolts of crypto is lacking for sure.

[17-Apr-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @dukeleto I like that script, tabbed and everything; shexy üòé

[17-Apr-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> mine's really feken ugly

[17-Apr-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _starts a movement where "private key" and "wif" aren't interchangeable in conversations_

[17-Apr-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BaBa WhiteSheep> Any layman friendly mini guide to access the funds on mobile?

[17-Apr-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> From my understanding, Agama needs a new release to update to the new HUSH chain, it should be coming in the near future.

[17-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BaBa WhiteSheep> Thank you @Berg. That is my understanding as well. So I shall crawl back to my dark corner and keep on waiting.. quietly.

[17-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> Why hush is mooning today?

[17-Apr-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You can see news on Hush by checking out our Twitter in the #hush-twitter channel.
We recently upgraded to Sapling and away from Sprout, becoming a KMD Asset Chain as well.

[17-Apr-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Didn't even realize. Is TradeSatoshi off of maintenance? Or is somebody just buying up the wall while it's still down?

[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> @Berg hope its grows to atleast 0.5 usd by end of April

[17-Apr-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We're working on helping out our liquidity by trying to bring on some more exchanges. We'll have updates as we make progress.

[17-Apr-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BIGMIX> hi ladies and gents been hodling for a while have my keys somewhere is there a mac wallet anywhere yet or just using kimodo one still?

[17-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Nice

[17-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Maybe they are buying hush classic

[17-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Wouldn't that suck :)

[17-Apr-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @BIGMIX no mac wallet yet, but various GUI wallets + web wallet is in the works

[17-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It would be pretty dumb for exchanges to use our legacy blockchain at this time, since DPoW is no longer enabled and 51% attackers can have a field day with it, if they so choose. And somebody soon will probably print infinite sprout money on the old chain, just for fun. There is a reason we upgraded! :carlos:

[17-Apr-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> Hi!! When tradesatoshi will receive update? I have all there!! If I buy now more coins, this is sure? Or funds will be lost? Thanks team!! üëçüëç

[17-Apr-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> @Berg , still under maintenance. Looks like someone decided to buy a few K's of Hush today. Hope they will allow deposits/withdrawals soon.

[18-Apr-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Welcome back üòÉ , You're not required to do anything currently, just wait until new wallets(which support Hush v3) get released, Your old private key will work on the new R addresses which if you want you can find out by using this handy tool( https://dexstats.info/addressconverter.php )
