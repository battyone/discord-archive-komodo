[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it can send all your funds away

[22-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Well that's not out of the ordinary

[22-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Add a captcha or a slider or 2fa

[22-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> 2fa would resolve all of this

[22-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> A send tx requires 2fa

[22-Sep-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi¬≤ i will wait while you code that and put into prod üòâ

[22-Sep-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> 2fa?

[22-Sep-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> adding 2fa to the app, gosh

[22-Sep-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Okay, I'll look in the Android developers toolkit

[22-Sep-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> can't imagine how much code that is. I was joking üòâ

[22-Sep-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> It'll be there

[22-Sep-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Hahaha

[22-Sep-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> What do u think tho

[22-Sep-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Does that solve the problem?

[22-Sep-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, but also might be a lot of work to add. not sure! I have never actually done the backend of adding 2fa to an app

[22-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> almost definitely adds to my infinite work load üòâ

[22-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Hehe

[22-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> make an issue for that @Privatoshi¬≤

[22-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> I'll see if I can find instructions

[22-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you need to make your first gh issue, anyway

[22-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763

GILETS JAUNES ACTO 45  

LOS CAPUCHA DE MACRON
Patrullan las calles de Par√≠s encapuchados, no son el "bloque negro" anarquista, son los BAC, los "para" de Macron. 
45 semanas de lucha en las calles de Francia, ni las capuchas intimidan a los Chalecos.

[22-Sep-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> The BAC, are "Macron's Special Unit--thugs in black shirts that are viollllent"... This is some shit

[22-Sep-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi¬≤ can you give us the TLDR on why the yellowvest riots are happening, in a "fair and balanced" way?

[22-Sep-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The HK protests are about extraditing HK citizens to Chinese mainland, it seems clear. I don't understand the FR riots, other than they seem like the "1%" movement of the US from ~10-15 years ago, when it first started, there were riots and sit-in but it all died down

[22-Sep-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> I think what it comes down to, is austerity and a tightening of the economy, which leads to many things, and the middle to lower class usually are affected more bc they have less.

[22-Sep-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Macron wanted to increase fuel tax, limit taxes on the rich

[22-Sep-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> And the yellow helmets decided that without a rise in minimum wage, an increase in fuel tax & other things, that this wasn't a tenable situation. The most important being austerity driven legislation that leaves the economy in a tough situation.

[22-Sep-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> Plus they demand Macron resign

[22-Sep-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> This is about seeing a future

[22-Sep-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> @denio

[22-Sep-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> What do u think?

[22-Sep-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is about simple economics

[22-Sep-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> inflation is making paper money worthless

[22-Sep-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> cost of food, gas, rent/etc keeps going up

[22-Sep-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and average citizens are boiled alive

[22-Sep-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "austerity" stuff rarely works, but sometimes can, like in all-out-war

[22-Sep-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't think austerity enforced from bureacrats down to the "serfs" has ever worked

[22-Sep-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> austerity only works if everyone is united to fight a common enemy

[22-Sep-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hence, 44 weeks of riots

[22-Sep-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi¬≤ now i understand, thank you

[22-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh we use the term "serf" a lot in non-russian society, czar we stole from you üôÇ

[22-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> is the word "serf" russian?

[22-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> @denio if that fascinated you, you should be concerned. What happens in France, usually happens in Germany

[22-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> You two have more similarities, than differences, and I mean that in a positive manner.

[22-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> iirc i learnt about serfs while studying russian hisroty, was some time ago and memory hazy. the other word is usually spelt Tsar, and Czar is the proper russian spelling iirc

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi¬≤> @denio Is that what Europeans want?
