[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh download the mac binary from there

[24-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then we are 99% there

[24-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> @dukeleto thank you! üòÉ Please note that it's binary compiled on Jun 11 from `komodoplatform/master` Not sure if it have needed features

[24-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TonyL aye, it might not, but still, you deserve the tip

[24-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh sorry, your princess is in another castle. That binary is too old

[24-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> June 11th is the distant past in KMD-world

[24-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i just got this merged to `dev` like 2 weeks ago

[24-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> jl777/dev ? Let me trigger build on my side

[24-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> woooooooo

[24-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thanks for all the help

[24-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TonyL yeah, i submitted to `dev` instead of `jl777` branch and I think james cherry-picked it other places

[24-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this hack is going to work, but it's a bit like paper-clips and duct tape üòÉ

[24-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> if it works, will my coins b safe?

[24-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> yeah, there is CI - just OSX workers inactive atm

[24-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I haven't put the patch in yet to teach KMD that HUSH does not need sprout files, so I am sorry to say, you will need to download those files (you might already have them anyway and then it doesn't matter. You definitely already have them if you have Pirate on the same computer)

[24-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh very valid question. TonyL is a KMD core dev and those are posted to the official KMD github, so they are as trustable as anything else you download or `git clone` from KMD's Github

[24-Jul-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh TLDR: you might get an error about needing to run `fetch-params.sh`, tell me if you do

[24-Jul-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> started build on my mac air, will take some time...

[24-Jul-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh and I will say, you are on the `bleeding!` edge of cryptocoin adoption! Can you feel the Winds of Freedom in your sails?

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thanks @TonyL

[24-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Yes Duke, yes i can

[24-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> radix42 is especially amazing because she makes binaries for weird ARM devices like raspberry pi's and things like that. Ain't nobody want to do that

[24-Jul-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I suggested address validation yesterday and it's in a new release today! That is pretty cool

[24-Jul-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The above address validation feature will be merged to SilentDragon soon, yay

[24-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> @dukeleto it's not some official / tested build - just compiled latest dev on my mac. And it's built on Mojave so should be compatible with Mojave only

[24-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Just some emergency help for funds recovery üòÉ

[24-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ah, blarg. radix42 said they were having problems getting their setup to work on Mojave

[24-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am not sure which version of mac gigamesh is on

[24-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> I had some sexual rendezvous with deps on Mojave right after update

[24-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> But then cleared my brew deps and everything fine now üòÉ

[24-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Wow

[24-Jul-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hackintosh?

[24-Jul-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ok gonna give it a whirl

[24-Jul-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thx @TonyL @dukeleto

[24-Jul-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> now i got komodod and komodo-cli

[24-Jul-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> not really sure what im supposed to do now

[24-Jul-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh ok!

[24-Jul-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you do all the `ln -s` commands, from the main SD directory, except you copy the `komodod` binary to the SilentDragon directory

[24-Jul-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> instead of symlinking it, but symlinking would work too. Copying seems simpler üòÉ

[24-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are like 99.9% there

[24-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all of this stuff is done for the user when all the right binaries exist. See how much work it is!!

[24-Jul-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ok so i copy those files into SD dir... how about hushd and hush-cli?

[25-Jul-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh those can by symlinks or you can copy

[25-Jul-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most important is `komodod` and `hushd`, `hush-cli` and `komodo-cli` are not used by SD but good to have

[25-Jul-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Tonys downlaod had komodo-cli and komodod.

[25-Jul-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> there was no hushd or hush-cli

[25-Jul-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I will run the ln -s commands but i doubt SD will work since i dont have  hushd

[25-Jul-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Not working

[25-Jul-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> does anybody know what i'm supposed to do to get a copy of hushd?

[25-Jul-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh sorry I didn't see your question, `hushd` is in the main hush3.git repo: https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/blob/master/src/hushd

[25-Jul-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can symlink it or just copy that script there

[25-Jul-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Download this raw script and `chmod +x 755 hushd`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MyHush/hush3/master/src/hushd @gigamesh

[25-Jul-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or you can do `ln -sf ../hush3/src/hushd` , if you are in SD directory and your hush3 repo is in the same directory as your SD repo

[25-Jul-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then you should be able to start SD normally and it will find all the things

[25-Jul-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My guess is it tells you to run `fetch-params` because latest KMD doesn't yet know that HUSH doesn't need to download some stuff

[25-Jul-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto i got this ``Can't find hushd at  "/Applications/SilentDragon/silentdragon.app/Contents/MacOS/hushd"
Verifying param files exist
All param files found!
``

[25-Jul-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so i copied hushd to /Applications/SilentDragon/silentdragon.app/Contents/MacOS/

[25-Jul-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> its no longer crashing

[25-Jul-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I must admit im lost

[25-Jul-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i think ill trash it all and start again

[25-Jul-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> is is possible when u refer to the SD folder u mean SilentDragon.app (which is a directory in OSX)

[25-Jul-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i dont know how putting hushd and komodod into the SD folder and then making symlinks to ../hush3/src/hushd makes sense when i dont have that directory tree at all

[25-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> getting this error really phased me:

[25-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 1 month ago, Zcash decided to throw their hat into the ring of "multi-part memos", which you might imagine, Hush has opinions about: https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/247/commits/16ee90dea840757abef7db5ccff4274a6594c5cc

[25-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash is planning to support 64KB memos, one day in the distant future

[25-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So now it's a race, who will win? Hush deploying 200KB memos to mainnet or Zcash deploying their 64KB memos to their mainnet?

[25-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: I am trying to find nice things to say about that ZIP, because I respect str4d, but can't

[25-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that ZIP is crap and Hush and HushList are miles ahead of them, imho

[25-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I just found it, and I am currently trying to formulate better constructive criticism, other than "this is shit"

[25-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can see that ZEC + HUSH will diverge how they use the memo field, and that is fine. HushList Protocol is superior

[25-Jul-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
