Happy Thanksgiving!!

[28-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do you guys use Zaddrs?

[28-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Z-Addresses (Shielded Transactions)

[28-Nov-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> @Privatoshi never used em

[28-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gogo It is one of the key features of Hush

[28-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> @Privatoshi which wallet uses it

[28-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> SilentDragon, SilentDragonLite , SilentDragon Android

[28-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You must store your Hush in a Zaddr

[28-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You have two addresses, t-addresses, transparent addresses.

[28-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Z-Addresses, shielded addressed, which help privacy

[28-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> I'm gonna download the silentdragon app

[28-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Which wallet can stake kmd on?

[28-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm not sure. You can claim KMD rewards using Agama, I think

[28-Nov-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gogo If you download SD app & can find your Z-Address, DM it to me, and I'll send you a few Hush

[28-Nov-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ```We need SilentDragon Android mobile screenshots, of the following.
And, we will give some Hush for helping out, too.

i.  Zaddr send+recieved
ii. Zaddr send+recieve memo```

[28-Nov-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gogo When you get it installed, just make sure that you DM me, your Z-Address.
Don't paste that in public, you want to keep it private.

[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Guys... what's the current rate of KMD/BTC at AtomicDEX right now?

[29-Nov-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Dont see any

[29-Nov-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I see HUSH/KMD - 
1 HUSH = 0.064 KMD

[29-Nov-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gogo> Hush is higher than kmd

[29-Nov-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> OK thanks, guys!

[29-Nov-19 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No, no it's not higher than KMD..
1 Hush is equal to 0.064 Komodo

[29-Nov-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
