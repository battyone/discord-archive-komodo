Proud to announce $HUSH has support for #superlite clients via #nSPV ! 
Notarized Simple Payment Verification is protected by delayed-Proof-of-Work and similar to the Flyclient paper.
Up to 10,000X more efficient bandwidth+storage than Electrum ü§Øü§Øü§Ø

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nSPV = notarized Simple Payment Verification

[23-Jul-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH has it already

[23-Jul-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we just need to do the work to set up the servers/etc

[23-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> normal nodes are the "servers"

[23-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes. to clarify, we need to set up a few public nSPV seed nodes. I haven't done that yet

[23-Jul-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> 1 was able to support saturation level spam from 800 superlite clients

[23-Jul-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is pretty amazing

[23-Jul-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe the original FlyClient author will chime in

[23-Jul-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> flyclient is much more efficient than normal headers only SPV

[23-Jul-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not sure the efficiency gains compared to flyclient

[23-Jul-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I like this model, because a Sybil attack must run full nodes, instead of some 3rd party servers. It increases the work an attacker needs to do

[23-Jul-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and this model seems to completely remove the "malicious server that phishes you" problem, that makes Electrum unusable for the average person

[23-Jul-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most BTC electrum servers are malicious currently, and if older versions of Electrum connect, those clients can be phished via malicious "error messages", still to this day

[23-Jul-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a sad state of affairs. It used to be BTC electrum was a reasonable and safe option

[23-Jul-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> another aspect is that a malicious node cant give you false data, well it can, but it wont validate

[23-Jul-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so all that a malicious node can do is withhold data about what utxo you have

[23-Jul-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i guess it can also falsely report about transactions in mempool, but for large amounts if you wait for notarizations to be validated, it is like dpowconfs

[23-Jul-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the mempool messages are more for convenience

[23-Jul-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the entire set of fullnodes in the network will end up supporting 800x the number of superlite clients

[23-Jul-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and the superlite just needs to connect to a single honest node

[23-Jul-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so it has the similar characteristic as PoW, where you just need one valid peer

[23-Jul-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a very resilient feature of this nSPV protocol

[23-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> DPoW is a tree that bears more fruit each succeeding year

[23-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, i never expected it could be this useful

[23-Jul-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> like a datastructure that is non-intuitive at first, but then ends up being drastically useful in many seemingly unrelated tasks. I am constantly amazed at the unintended positive benefits of dpow

[23-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> having addressindex and spentindex is also a critical part of the nSPV

[23-Jul-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> without it, it wouldnt be possible, or require using explorer nodes for the listunspent data

[23-Jul-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ah, fascinating. All HUSH nodes enable all those indexes by default, as well

[23-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon GUI wallet enables them by default in new confs, so GUI users have them by default

[23-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so there will be hundreds of nSPV fullnodes

[23-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What's this all mean to end user?

[23-Jul-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> possibly exponentially faster and more secure transactions.

[23-Jul-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> much greater ability to scale. also smart contracts being able to run on mobile platforms

[23-Jul-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nSPV allows for light (potentially mobile) wallets that only have to download a tiny fraction of the blockchain data to operate. That is what it means for end users

[23-Jul-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It means, no matter how large the Hush blockchain grows, light wallets will only have to download a small amount of data

[23-Jul-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> these are "superlite" wallets. It's a more efficient algorithm than Electrum uses

[23-Jul-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has a smal blockchain right now, but when we allow file uploads, that could change. nSPV could be very important to Hush scalability in the future

[23-Jul-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> electrum are API servers which involved polling multiple ones to get the merkleproofs you need. also it doesnt use SPV for validation, but that requires all the headers, which at 2kb per header adds up very fast

[23-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> nSPV gets the best of both worlds. nearly as small bandwidth as API servers, nearly as secure as fullnodes

[23-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> from start to login to spending funds can be in seconds, and that is with dpow validation

[23-Jul-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c it is possible that a server providing nSPV services can be compensated in some way? I am thinking something like -ac_notarypay, where we bake in an incentive system for honest SPV nodes. If only a single honest nSPV node is needed for a node to get the correct data, maybe it's not important

[23-Jul-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Another thought I had is that Electrum infrastructure heavily relies on DNS, and so DNS-based blocking is effective to stop average users. nSPV doesn't use DNS and so DNS-based censorship doesn't work

[23-Jul-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the load is comparable to normal p2p messages

[23-Jul-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if to charge for that then do we start charging for relaying blocks and transactions?

[23-Jul-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i optimized the network bandwidth needed, so we can return just scan results of the mempool, instead of the entire mempool

[23-Jul-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it would be an effective way to combat an extreme adversarial environment where most nSPV servers are evil, but maybe we don't need to worry about that apocalyptic world just yet

[23-Jul-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> listunspent/listtransactions has a skipcount so you can get just the latest txid

[23-Jul-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nSPV seems like it's much less resource-hungry than being a notary node

[23-Jul-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what would an evil nSPV node do? return invalid data that is immediately detected as invalid?

[23-Jul-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> nothing like a notary node at all

[23-Jul-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> with 800 clients spamming full blast the CPU load got to 100%
