[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If your funds went to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF they were protected by KMD, if they didn't, they were stolen by the attacker

[10-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If they haven't moved yet, YOU REALLY SHOULD MOVE ALL FUNDS NOW üòÉ

[10-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Attacker is just going thru a massive list of seed phrases and privkeys, checking their value across all chains

[10-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <zeroerrordev> üòÆ  let me get up to pace. But hush almost a year created an asset on agama. Had an airdrop but will find some more info before asking. Thanks.

[10-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> @dukeleto it says zero transactions at all , but doesn't give me a balance for the r address?

[10-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @zeroerrordev you are talking about the BTCH kmd asset chain. Hush is *also* a KMD asset chain now, since our new mainnet launch in April

[10-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zero xtns, no balance means it's an unused address

[10-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <zeroerrordev> Right on the pointüò¨  thanks will  read it to cath up  @dukeleto thanks mate

[10-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That address has no funds and no xtns on old Hush chain

[10-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that is not the address

[10-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> @dukeleto sound bro my hush is on the web wallet n hasn't moved (assume it's safe there?) 
Btch is on agama, do I need to move that?

[10-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> @dukeleto

[10-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Francis move all coins that ever touched agama

[10-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Francis funds on web wallet should be safe, unless you also used some of those private keys in Agama, which sounds unlikely.

[10-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The seed phrase for agama and the web wallet are different and incompatible, so you can't use one in the other.

[10-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Francis> Okay sound so now I just need to be able to connect to the spv servers an I can check my btch bal

[10-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @GameWatch21 POA|DOGE i am really trying to understand, with my old brain. Are you playing a game, where you mine coins "virtually", in the game?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i am so old I still have AOL 1.x 3.5 inch "floppy" disks somewhere. At least with AOL floppy disks, you could just tape over the "write protect" area (they came so that you couldn't write them, but you just put tape over the area and it becomes writeable) and you have a free 1.4MB floppy disk!!! It was the best. AOL CD's mostly just went to the landfill. #nostalgia

[10-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @GameWatch21 POA|DOGE that game is pulling real price and difficulty numbers, i can see that. What must you do to "unlock" certain coins and what does `Storage 2aa` mean?

[10-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @GameWatch21 POA|DOGE if you do certain things in the game, do they pay out real coins, something like that?

[10-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <GameWatch21 POA|DOGE> Yup they payout with HORA tokens a ERC20 TOKEN eth maybe...
And for now it doesnt have value cause the exchange still need time
But the wallet is open

[10-Jun-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Pendula Yes, it's safe to keep them there

[10-Jun-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pendula> I used with btch, but did not like it :), I still find the old hush wallet (mac version) better than komodo agama

[10-Jun-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Pendula  ok, the reason i asked was because recently there was a vulnerability found in Agama so if your Hush ever touched agama then it would be safer to move them to a different address not created/used in Agama
