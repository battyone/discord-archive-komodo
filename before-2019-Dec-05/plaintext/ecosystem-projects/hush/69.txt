[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we will upstream our supply curve and then we can use stock komodod, that is the plan

[19-Apr-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I haven't tweeted out this whitepaper yet

[19-Apr-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just this discord has been told, y'all get first access

[19-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so many people have asking about Cryptopia

[19-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: The double spend attacks happened before DPoW was enabled at Cryptopia, DPoW is solid. No critical security issue has ever been found in DPoW

[dscrd-hush] <Mylo Cakeshop komodo-in-a-box> interesting WP, full of facts you just can't make up....

[19-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> At first, before the Sprout inflation bug, we were not sure what to do about the attacker, they could always move all their funds to zaddrs!!!!!

[19-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> when the Sprout inflation bug happened, it kind of saved Hush. It forced me to realize that something must be done. Hush could not stay a Sprout chain

[19-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This fact, of removing Sprout support, means that the attacker has nowhere to hide

[19-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only transparent addresses are supported in airdrops/etc

[19-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mylo Cakeshop komodo-in-a-box> congrats on first sprout-fee BC

[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Execute in other terminal window: `.\hush-cli getaccountaddress ""`

[19-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> @TonyL  I do not understand

[19-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> 1) Open other cmd terminal window
2) Navigate to folder where you have husd and hush-cli by `cd foldername`
3) Type `.\hush-cli getaccountaddress ""` in terminal and press Enter

[19-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> CLI = Command Line Interface
so you will need to operate this wallet by sending commands to it

[19-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> hush cli.bat closes

[19-Apr-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Maybe on windows it's `.\hush-cli.exe getaccountaddress ""`

[19-Apr-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> `hushd` is what runs the blockchain and loads a wallet.dat
`hush-cli` is what sends commands to `hushd`

[19-Apr-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> @Heno1974 On your screenshot I can't see command which you executed

[19-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Also you can call `.\hush-cli.exe getnewaddress`

[19-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> no exe.  bat:

[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Oh ok, I see

[19-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> So `.\hush-cli.bat getnewaddress`

[19-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> They succeeded.
is the wallet going down somewhere?

[19-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> i'd suggest backing up your new address and privatekey and wallet.dat , and then import that to gui when it is released

[19-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> (the .bat should work fine - it has all the params)

[19-Apr-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Yes - for this there are `dumpprivkey` and `importprivkey` calls. Description of both can be found on portal above

[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Definition of assetchain is something like a:
```A Parallel Chain (often refered to as Assetchain) is a independently created blockchain (by a user, business or any other 3rd party) that inherits all of Komodo's features```
