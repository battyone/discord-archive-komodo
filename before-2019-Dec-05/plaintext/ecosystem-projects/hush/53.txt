[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> At least the miner has a farm update for 2-3 years, and not 3-4 months. ASIC

[06-Apr-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> meh, that's only a 1/2 true claim; my batch 1 minis still turn positive ROI and I paid $2k for them new

[06-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> That GPU chip makers intentionally hold back advanced chips to increase profits in selling overstock isn't really a pro-GPU argument ðŸ˜›

[06-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Now it is easier to buy a coin than to buy equipment and wait 3-6 months to get the same amount of coins. Purchase and further POS more efficient

[06-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> yes, but when you scale that out further, it doesn't always hold true

[06-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> and most PoS = righ get richer and poor struggle to pretend

[06-Apr-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> The GPU has a more serious enemy FPGA. Advanced chip will not save the situation

[06-Apr-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Im getting about 40% more by buying hash instead of coin...

[06-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I feel like I'm in a time machine to 2011 with the renewed interest in FPGAs ðŸ˜›

[06-Apr-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> In any case, mining is great for a novice cryptosystem, then eventually you realize that there are simpler methods of earning

[06-Apr-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lol was just crunching the #s b4 you started talking

[06-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `then eventually you realize that there are simpler methods of earning`
I must not have hit "eventually" yet, I'm still a professional miner ðŸ˜›

[06-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> The question remains, what is simpler? Buy ASIC / GPU / FPGA and extract 3-6 conditionally 1000 coins? Or for the same money to buy immediately 1000 coins?

[06-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Jwolf gave an example that some coins can be obtained in larger quantities by purchasing power. But this is not much different from a simple purchase immediately.

[06-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Well I'm going to the Bitcoin ATM machine to buy some more hash right now so it's not that f****** hard

[06-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Much easier than spending a lot of time on equipment maintenance.

[06-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Don't even have to worry about a power bill at that point but I do have a z Mini

[06-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> So I came to the conclusion that mining does not make sense, only for those who like the process

[06-Apr-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Takoy_Nahal that fault in your question is that you ignore that with 0 more cost, you can change 1 line in a text file and earn 1000 coinY when you're done with coinX

[06-Apr-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> That's cool it keeps the difficulty low nevermind

[06-Apr-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> power bill falls under CoGS

[06-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool Did not quite understand your answer

[06-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `a lot of time on equipment maintenance.`
I'm not sure that 98 seconds with an air hose once a month counts as "a lot of time"

[06-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `Did not quite understand your answer`
Your question was spend $850 on an ASIC or $850 on CoinX....
I'm saying that you're leaving out that after you have $850 worth of CoinX, you can earn $850 worth of CoinY with that ASIC and you cannot do that with your $850 worth of CoinX and still have CoinX
ASIC = you have both coins
$ = you have 1 coin

[06-Apr-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> The equipment has a tendency to wear out, become obsolete, you have to pay electricity bills, build a room (if you have a lot of farms), a ventilation system, buy wires. Inno 3D video cards, for example, often have cooling coolers broken. Why all this when you can simply buy by pressing the mouse button several times?

[06-Apr-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ```low risk equals low reward```

[06-Apr-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ` Inno 3D video cards, for example, often have cooling coolers broken. `
and BrandY caught fire; all the more reason ASIC > GPU

[06-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> If you have money to buy 10 ASICs, you can buy COIN x, coin y, coin z and 10-15 more coins by collecting a large portfolio. If any of the coins get bored, you sell it and buy a new one. I do not see any problems with this

[06-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `The equipment has a tendency to wear out`
So, I'm guessing you've only ever purchased one writing utensil in your life and you still use that exact same one?

[06-Apr-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `you can buy COIN x, coin y, coin z and 10-15 more coins by collecting a large portfolio`
And how's that working out for the folks that bought in 17 months ago?

[06-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I bought different equipment) Different manufacturers)

[06-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Folks that bought HUSH at $4 and look at their portfolio now might not agree with your math

[06-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> At that exact point in time I bought ASICs that cashed out and bought my wife a new car

[06-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Those people have to wait for the next bull run and sell their equipment.

[06-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> why wait and maybe earn? how's that "better" than actually earning?

[06-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> sell? I'm still running the 1st 1080 I bought 2 years+ ago

[06-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I'm not saying that mining is for everyone, just that your claim is faulty

[06-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> My mathematics is correct now and earlier, you could also take a loan in 2017, buy a lot of L3 + and sell your wifeâ€™s old car to pay part of the loan. It all depends on the time. I mined and bought HUSH, in both cases my balance in USD has greatly decreased, just now I can buy HUSH at a cheap price, wait for a bullrun and buy a car for my wife)

[06-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> again, your claim is based on marrying yourself to only 1 coin

[06-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I hit positive ROI on my HUSH miners and moved them to CoinY when the price was better

[06-Apr-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> were it not for my current involvement in projects, I'd still be mining HUSH several times a week

[06-Apr-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> My statement is true for me and many other people; professional miners are more interested in getting a coin than buying. I tried many methods and came to this conclusion. If you are mining now, then I would choose POS

[06-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> If you only knew how easy it is to break most PoS systems, you wouldn't still feel that way ðŸ˜›

[06-Apr-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> No, I mined many other coins, HUSH was not the only one, there were many different coins)

[06-Apr-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Break a simple user or in general?

[06-Apr-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> with basic cli commands

[06-Apr-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> as many users as you'd like and at a quite minimal cost

[06-Apr-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I am not so deeply familiar with such things. I am a simple user) Maybe you're right.

[06-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `I am not so deeply familiar with such things. `
Most people aren't and I doubt even the broad strokes of it will ever be released into the wild because of the overall damage it would do to the space as a whole

[06-Apr-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> In any case, I have never been against POW mining, as a tool supporting the network

[06-Apr-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> mind ðŸ’¥ = PoS is, in fact, PoW

[06-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Does someone run a testnet with hush3?

[06-Apr-19 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> afaik, there isn't an "official" chain for it
all you need is 2 nodes of your own

[06-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Thank you @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool  for your answer, now I try to understand it.

[06-Apr-19 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I would like to install a HUSH block explorer on my server. I want to get ready before rocking to hush3.

[06-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> build it on each computer

run `komodo/src/hushd` on each

then run `komodo/src/hush-cli addnode the_ip_of_the_otherPC onetry` on each

then `komodo/src/hush-cli setgenerate true 1` on one of them

and you're off and running

[06-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Thank you, I just understand the principle.

[06-Apr-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool Yes i  know about Pos=Pow

[07-Apr-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scott> If my Hush is on cryptopia, does it become useless?

[07-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigoplast> @scott  Hush wallet on cryptopia is with "t"  addresses so you do your conclusion :thinkaboutit:

[07-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scott> Iâ€™m not techy, I donâ€™t know what that means

[07-Apr-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DREverett> @scott - per dukeleto "...exchanges will swap balances and convert your t1... addresses to the new R... addresses of Hush v3"

[07-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scott> Oh okay, so as long as cryptopia does their part, everything is good

[07-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scott> Thanks!

[07-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spartacus> that's a big conditional

[07-Apr-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `that's a big conditional`
That's what you agreed to when you gave them your currency

[07-Apr-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spartacus> never planned on them having it for 6 months

[07-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> then you planned poorly when you chose to give them ownership

[07-Apr-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spartacus> what can i say, it's the only exchange that had hush i can bear using

[08-Apr-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I've got a lot to learn from you computergenje

[08-Apr-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> ```
ZelCore won't be supporting upcoming transition of Hush chain to a Komodo asset chain type as of following reasons
- Transition to a different type of chain requires a great amount of time to build supporting solution such as explorers, electrumx servers and ZelCore adjustments.
- Hush (after having premine) is adding a significant development fee yet they are not willing to pay for our free time to build and support Hush in ZelCore nor willing to share server bills or even endorse and market ZelCore as a supported wallet.
- New Hush daemon is not ready for release few days prior fork. No builds for any platform were provided by Hush team.
- To remind: ZelCore solutions were offering all services to Hush for free for almost a year supporting Hush on all platforms (windows, Linux, macOS, android, iOS) as the only wallet offering light and full node wallets as well as hosting an explorer â€“ which still is the only working explorer for Hush.
- Hush is for quite some time considered a dead coin with minimal development, many chain reorganizations (some resulting in successful 51% attacks), known blockchain vulnerabilities and trading volume being less than $30 per day (according to CMC).
- We do not believe that a transition to new chain type will help resolve Hush inactivity problems
- Upcoming fork is effectively destroying peopleâ€™s funds being in shielded addresses
- We do not see any plans, roadmap, need and uniqueness of Hush

What will happen with Hush in ZelCore?
Hush in ZelCore will fall into delisted category remaining on the old chain with no fore coming support. During this delisted period, users of Hush should backup their private keys. Hush explorer will remain on the old chain sticking to current network rules.

We wish Hush a bright future.

[08-Apr-19 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spartacus> what the hell is zelcore

[08-Apr-19 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @TheTrunk Are you part of "ZelCore"?

[08-Apr-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spartacus> He is. Most of the (30) search results involve him.

[08-Apr-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `requires a great amount of time to build supporting solution such as explorers, electrumx servers and ZelCore adjustments`
That's the funniest joke I've heard so far this year. If they actually support all the chains they claim they do, that should take no more than an hr of actual work and maybe another 15 minutes to understand how P2PK works

[08-Apr-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Sound like a bunch of BS

[08-Apr-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `We do not see any plans, roadmap, need and uniqueness of Hush`
@TheTrunk You found "uniqueness" in SAFEcoin? What "uniqueness"? The "uniqueness" that they've rolled back their chain more times than every other chain you support combined?
If you're going to try backhanded-compliment FUD, do it where folks don't know better....

[08-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spartacus> Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard 
It's just the beasts under your bed 
In your closet, in your head

[08-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Genie Law #4973:
You don't get to support unSAFE and FUD *anything*, ever

[08-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Right, the new chain is to stop the 51% attack that debunks 2 of his points right there plus everyone  has been warned for months about not being shielded and it says right on the site that  "As of Sat Mar 02 07:35:53 PST 2019, 1.18% of current HUSH supply is in Sprout addresses." not much being destroyed...

[08-Apr-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `everyone has been warned for months `
You're not allowed to expect folks to accept personal responsibility over their currency

[08-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Thank you @TheTrunk  for all that you have done so far and for this frank and direct communication. Who knows, you (ZelCore) may change your mind later. ðŸ˜€

[08-Apr-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What is funny is we never asked for ZEL to support HUSH in any way, they did it of their own accord

[08-Apr-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We told people not to trust their closed source wallet.

[08-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not sure what else there is to say.

[08-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk you should really re-think this statement `only wallet offering light and full node wallets `

[08-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because Komodo Agama Desktop and Mobile both support Hush. it just looks like a poorly written marketing update

[08-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @TheTrunk I know you don't control all the decisions of the ZEL foundation, and I thank you for whatever stuff you did for Hush. I am willing to give you a bounty to keep your Hush explorer up during the transition, but I understand if you just want to turn it off

[08-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In general, i am bored of all the drama between coins and just want to hack on code and whitepapers and apps that use our new chain

[08-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> @dukeleto  is there a link with instructions on how to migrate my HUSH to KMD chain?

[08-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> ok I see something here:
https://myhush.org/sapling/

[08-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @LocoMB it depends if you have a full node, light node or funds are on an exchange (i.e. you don't really own them), and I will be providing docs, still being worked on

[08-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have funds on Cryptopia/TradeSatoshi/Safe.Trade, you don't need to do anything

[08-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they do the work

[08-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> I am fairly sure I was only using the HUSH wenwallet- so all I have is a privkey/seed

[08-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> naw- I never leave funds oin exchanges ðŸ˜…

[08-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush web wallet seed is different than a private key, a seed phrase can hold bajillions of privkeys

[08-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are migrating the web wallet, @gilardh is working on that

[08-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> I think it is a privkey- I'll have to check it out - just want to make sure not to lose funds
