[dscrd-hush] <Berg> The common man likely doesn't know whether action is needed or not

[04-Jan-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg you could also say "Only 80 BTCH exists in sprout zaddrs, so most likely this does not effect you"

[04-Jan-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "Do you have BTCH funds in an address that starts with z?" If not, this doesn't concern you"

[04-Jan-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it could be just a single person, maybe even a KMD NN operator, who knows. That person might not even need help, since average users never used these zaddrs

[04-Jan-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yeah, all that doesn't fit into a tweet very well

[04-Jan-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Scirockoe> Are funds on a t1 adress still good or did I miss a tokenswap?

[04-Jan-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> to my understanding T addresses are A-OK üòÉ

[04-Jan-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Just Z addresses

[07-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, 2.0.0 has dpow enabled, but not dpowconfs

[08-Jan-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> What issue hush team have to resolve with cryptopia ? Hush is great coin, but now is to long blocked on cryptopia and the price is low because of that

[08-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Hey guys. Any new big updates in the pipeline?

[08-Jan-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @jl777c  @dukeleto  actually might be better if coins not possible to attack with 51% (like dPOW) would be listed on that site with a label like "attack-proof" or at least having the cost same as BTC. Reason - if it is not there it looks like it was not analysed or not included in the list, and reader of that page may conclude that in that case if sth is not listed there "must be even more crap".

[08-Jan-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> So it's good if Hush is there, just the correct label would be nice.

[08-Jan-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã I do find it useful to know how much it *would* cost to attack Hush, if it didn't have DPoW. Interesting stat, so yes, some kind tag that explains dpow prevents double spends would be fine

[08-Jan-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> well I believe BTC attack cost is fine enough estimation ?

[08-Jan-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> for dPOW

[08-Jan-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> ?

[08-Jan-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what I mean, is that even though Hush should not be listed, I find the number they estimate interesting to know

[08-Jan-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if it is not listed there to avg user it looks like it might be not even worth analysed...

[08-Jan-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> to be listed there with a high mark

[08-Jan-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @badenglishtea dpowconfs is coming in the next version of Hush (2.0.1), and we are starting to plan for the sapling upgrade, is what I would say to "big updates" in the pipelines. hush-ng has about 10 spoken languages supported recently, i18n support, which I think is a big feature. a few devs have been helping me with hush-ng

[08-Jan-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> when you make a list of anything and you do nto put some items it may be confusing, people do not know if it is not hetere "because it is not relevant" or "it was not know to author" or "it's not even worth considering". In any case better to be listed and show to be good, then not listed at all.

[08-Jan-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Komodo used to be listed on crypto51, i told them to remove it, and they did

[08-Jan-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Cool. Well im still holding some Hush. Thought it was a good time to check in. On the one year price high anniversary ha

[08-Jan-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also Hush, but then it got re-added. It's just some dudes website, and he can do what he wants

[08-Jan-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I wish I got some much power üòõ

[08-Jan-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @badenglishtea oh gosh, what a year

[08-Jan-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Yea understatement

[08-Jan-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @badenglishtea you are probably a BTCH hodler too, and BTCH has Sapling support already and will benefit from the hush-ng wallet (it may become a dual wallet where you can flip a switch and use either Hush or BTCH (bot not both at the same time))

[08-Jan-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not trying to compete with a multi-coin wallet like Agama, but it makes sense to support both of our coins in one wallet. also reduces maintenance overhead for devs to not generate 2X the binaries, releases, etc

[08-Jan-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Yes, definitely a BTCH holder. Interesting.

[08-Jan-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Been crazy busy still need to catch up on all the projects i am still holding ha

[08-Jan-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this explain "dpow confs": https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPOW-conf.html

[08-Jan-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR, it's like confirmations that know about notarization to BTC. They prevent double spends

[08-Jan-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in such a way that exchanges can change no code at all, or very very little

[08-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have been making lots of fixes in upstream KMD, which flow down to Hush and other coins that support dpow

[08-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Relevant esp with ETC debacle ..

[08-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> indeed

[08-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some exchanges are starting to recommend or require PoW coins to use DPoW

[08-Jan-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that is pretty awesome validation that dpow is awesome and Hush is using awesome tech that most coins don't have

[08-Jan-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Pretty cool that it is already fully implemented

[08-Jan-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Cryptopia still down?

[08-Jan-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Doesnt the dpow validate the security of the network?

[08-Jan-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Ah BTCh

[08-Jan-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH+BTCH both have dpow

[08-Jan-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, a KMD person and myself tested Hush DPoW recently. A bunch of hash on NiceHash was rented, and a re-organization of Hush blocks, including a notarized block was attempted. It failed, as it should. maybe @Berg can help me write up something nice about it

[08-Jan-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yeah, that's definitely something to write about üòé. An more in-depth write up could be interesting, eg. what kind of methods were used etc. just don't reveal too much, could be problematic for other coins üòâ.

[08-Jan-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @dukeleto id love to help üòä do you have details on the amount of hash power was rented and any comparison for coins that were successfully attacked with the same amount? Any other details and comparisons would be awesome. I can blog it up on KMD and see if we can get some kind of real release

[08-Jan-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> It should be added to the website myhush.org the fact that HUSH is protected by dpow? But in which part?

[08-Jan-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i think it should be in the "Features" tab, it opens first and that's where there are info about Private messagin etc. Or maybe under hushlist here if we want it to have an separate "info box".

[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I was going to post an article about the Ethereum Classic attack yesterday but wasn't sure if it was allowed. I thought that a top 100 coin being attacked would be a good way to point people towards Hush with dpow protection, a smaller community coin with good potential.

[09-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @dukeleto they want to remove hush from cryptopia ?

[09-Jan-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 i think a small "blurb" and then an entire *page* like myhush.org/dpow/ would be best. It's most likely for people to find it, if a search term is part of the URL

[09-Jan-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jan-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> volume is really a limiting factor with BTCH

[10-Jan-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @dukeleto  if Hush-ng allows p2p comunication can it actually be shaped into z-mail a decentralized private email ? and should it be any way separate from z-chat - a  private decentralized chat?

[10-Jan-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> having email decentralziedr would be really cool

[10-Jan-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> actually having any kind of comunication decentralzied is a milestone for social media chat->email-> forum

[10-Jan-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> somewhere on the way a file upload would be needed too, not sure if KMD is getting some project for decentralized file storage

[10-Jan-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> that one itself would be huge too

[10-Jan-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> chat + forum would be a seed for decentralized twitter-like or facebook-like platforms

[10-Jan-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if these ideas need separate blockchains for some reason - these could be utilizing Hush/BTCH or even more later
