[dscrd-hush] <kaddycrypto> I guess this coin Dead ... I've been asking cryptopia for an update on hush and I've been raising concern here with the team. All I get to hear is.... "This is exchange fault.. we can't do anything"... 
Well as a developer of this coin, there should be some responsibility towards the investor.... Can we get an update or a tentative date when we can see wallet up and running ?

[16-Dec-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @kaddycrypto Berg is the one who's been most in contact with Cryptopia and this is what he's had to say about the situation this past week:

`Once the market gets re-enabled you'll be able to recover funds. I personally have a few thousand HUSH stuck in Cryptopia as well. We're working through rectifying the situation and getting markets back online.`

And

`I don't like to throw estimations on things, but I'm fairly confident that January will be the month. Don't hold me over a fire on that, but in my own judgement based on how things are progressing that's my estimation.`

[16-Dec-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Believe me when i say this coin is not dead, far from it. Hush is a passion for many of us involved, as in we don't get paid much/at all to do any of this, we're just passionate about the tech and how it will evolve. üòÉ

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Currently all developing has been pushed to the preparation of 2.0.1

[18-Dec-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We're prioritizing as needed. 2.0.1 is the highest priority for us as the update will bring us one step closer to re-enabling Cryptopia markets.

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @EarnETH1000000  Not really, the volume has been averaging > 14000 hush volume past 7 days , Production of coins are only 7200, so it healthy.
Progress has being extremely good, V2 is quick and stable. Developer solved tons of critical issues. most other coins will just have gave up and move to a new project with the enhancement.
Why price low? Many Reasons. 
1. Main reason, is 51% attack that happen months months ago. Cryptopia never had good monitors in place and they notice it too late. I estimate over 100K+ coins were double spend based on the volume, that time ASIC machine just hit the market. Many coins was targeted, not only at Cryptopia but many exchanges. Lot exchanges disable wallet quickly and corrected the market.  This also happened with Cryptonote coins(example: AEON coin, wallet was offline 3 months at bittrex, now you need to wait 28hours for confirmation, price 1/4). This will not happen again since a lot of measures have been putted in place. Not bulletproof but a step forward. I still recommend we link the proof to a coin as stellar/ripple instead of KMD. 
2. TradeSatoshi is not as trusted as Cryptopia and volume are crappy. They have too many scam coins and there fees are high. Most users will just wait it out instead of moving funds to a this exchange.
3. Most users are getting it cheap and will not drive the price up. Why pay more for no reason.
4. Only one stable exchange, if we have 3 stable exchange, users will be using hush to transfer across exchanges. As soon Cryptopia is up, the volume will increase and price will not go below $0.1 again.

New exchanges: Lot coins stuck at Cryptopia and profit of trades are at the loss. When the market recovers, people will start donating trade profits and new exchanges will bloom.

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto I had to correct my post twice üòÉ I had 7200 then read your post, then change it and now back to normal. So we healthy.
