[21-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> ikr

[21-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So how many people are excited to buy Libra and have their every financial move correlated to your every social media post? Quite a dystopian future

[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i'm not buying that shit even if it goes up x20

[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's like FB is doing advertising for coins that want to give you some privacy

[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> for the same reason i won't buy organs from human-trafficked children

[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> it's immoral

[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Once people see how Libra is a Surveillance Coin, maybe privacy-focused coins will get a bump

[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pepin the Healer having morals is important

[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> not that this has brought me anything but grief so far üòÖ

[21-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> even kinda envy people who can do stuff like that without a care in the world

not considering repercussions on other people is a trait common in sociopaths, apparently

[21-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> libra is a stablecoin, i dont think it will change much in price

[21-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> there is some second coin that gives you some percentage of revenues, maybe that is what people go crazy over

[21-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Facebook can shove Libra up their ass. You can‚Äôt come late to the party and expect to be #1

[21-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Jordan Belfort Libra is a major threat to both Retail & Central Banks. The US gov is trying to put a hold on the continuation of the project. For the average sheeple that don't understand crypto- it could be massive

[21-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Nothing good comes from libra. It‚Äôs just would make Facebook more of a government figure in the world

[21-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> that doesnt make it a good thing. It is deifnitely a surveillance coin like @dukeleto . It will mine data from every purchase you make. Sort of like Ecoin from Mr Robot if you've ever seen that show

[21-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Jordan Belfort "Nothing good comes from Libra". While i understand the high level thinking of use case, I would agree. However, I would argue that the on-road to crypto will likely increase 100 fold. Eventually, all those that own Libra will own Bitcoin

[21-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> If they had power over our money and our information. How is that different from out government

[21-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Bitcoin isnt going anywhere. It is a major step forward for crypto in my mind to see large business trying to tackle what Bitcoin has been successfully tackling for years

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> It only further legitimizes the use case of Bitcoin on a large scale

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Bitcoin then libra. Unless coinbase wants to step in and screw us over and go libra/fiat

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> I just think that they could build off a coin that already exist not create their own one

[21-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If the majority of Libra volume is on a Bitcoin pairing it'll be great for the short hype it builds

[21-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But knowing Facebook it'll be able to be purchased with fiat

[21-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Remember, they want centralized. That is why they are craeting their own "version" of peer to peer cash. Im sure many countries will follow suit in creating their own currencies

[21-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Is libra gonna be an ico or is it minable?

[21-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> I doubt Libra will be minable for the average folk

[21-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Yah yah it‚Äôs like J.P. Morgan coin. Centralized defeats the purpose

[21-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> there will likely be very high level nodes for those that have the power & money to afford them. Not to mention you most likely will have to verified to have a libra node

[21-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Your Facebook app will mine while you use it üòõ

[21-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Yes. It is Centralized. In the long term it will likely fail

[21-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Lol fb already uses enough of my battery

[21-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> which im sure will give rise to even more ownership of bitcoin

[21-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Interesting that it is pegged to many different currencies & assets

[21-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> USD being the world reserve is coming to an end. Libra is a major step forward in this process

[21-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> True but I rather google lead the way than fb

[21-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Remember also, Libra isn‚Äôt even a blockchain

[21-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Lol what

[21-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> How is it not a blockchain? I don‚Äôt know that much about it clearly

[21-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> What is it then?

[21-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> More like an index funds that owns some blockchain-based assets

[21-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Ugh
