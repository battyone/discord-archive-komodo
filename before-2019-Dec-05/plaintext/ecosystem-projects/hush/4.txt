[30-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @vayrak right now Hush has a healthy + thriving mining community and we would like to bring that to BTCH as well

[30-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if that happens, the BTCH development fund will greatly benefit Hush in the future, where as now we basically only have funds to pay monthly server expenses. BTCH and HUSH are a team of coins, one doing well benefits the other. That is how I look at it anyway

[30-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> And Staking BTCH will replenish the project budget and its entire community. It will be good for  all of us

[30-Aug-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Increasing liquidity, as @kh4567 mentioned, is important too. Because there is no mining, liquidity of BTCH is pretty low. Selling any decent amount of BTCH right now crashes the price

[30-Aug-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> As I understand Komodo gives about 5% a year to coin holders on Agama wallet, Do you consider the option of such a reward, but only with a higher percentage?

[30-Aug-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have never sold BTCH, but I paid radix42 in BTCH to do some work and he had a very had time selling it, and crashed the price by selling something like 500 BTCH from the bounty I gave him. Liquidity is important

[30-Aug-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal for whatever reason, I don't think asset chains can have interest (the 5%), it's only for KMD

[30-Aug-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we do staking, that is essentially equivalent to some kind of % interest. You get rewarded for HODLing. Interest happens on coins even if they are lost or dead, while staking requires the coins to be actually online

[30-Aug-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so staking rewards active nodes, which is probably healthy for the network

[30-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Yes this is useful for the network, thereby maintaining its stability. I personally like the system from Veruscoin, but recently large holders have seized the network and the blocks have come rarely. It seems that there is no protection from it

[30-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> HUSH and BTCH are my only two coins that are in the green today...

[31-Aug-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> @KentheCrypto  nice to meet you, followed all your videos, bought hush, turtle, now thinking to get some Aeges. what you think of bitcoin hush and komodo in general?

[dscrd-hush] <KentheCrypto> @pal I appreciate it man. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done my research on bitcoin hush so I don‚Äôt have much room to say about that

[31-Aug-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> @KentheCrypto  one thing worries me about Aegis is that their Github is not so active, what do you think? Any coins you recommend not yet covered in your video? Did you join Turtle channel? I am sure people will be happy to see you there, we all watched your turtle video

[31-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KentheCrypto> @pal yeah man understand, most of their code is in private

[31-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KentheCrypto> since they have a lot of competitors

[31-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> Hi

[31-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> Is hush going to fork or has it forked?

[31-Aug-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> And what is the news about bitcoin hush

[31-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @youngseies Hush is not forking, and BTCH will probably fork soon, we are still deciding details. The main reason to fork BTCH is to make it mineable

[31-Aug-18 02:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and hopefully stakeable as well üòÉ

[31-Aug-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <HUSH Bridge-Bot> [dscrdkmd] <xRobeSx> and hopefully stakeable as well üòÉ

[31-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it looks very probable that BTCH will be 50/50 PoW/PoS to protect current HODLers positions while also be attractive to miners

[31-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, we are very seriously looking at VerusHash instead of Equihash, which would mean CPU mining versus ASIC mining

[31-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH could be CPU-friendly to mine *and* have 51% attack protection, not sure many coins have that combination

[31-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if any

[31-Aug-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not possible to make a new KMD AC with VerusHash right this second, but it's coming very soon. CHIPS is also looking at converting to VerusHash as well, and I am helping a bit with that to learn all the details about VerusHash internals

[31-Aug-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg interesting

[31-Aug-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ASIC-resistance is such a weird marketing term üòÉ

[31-Aug-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> One of those blanket terms that piques everyones interest. Seems to be all people talk about when it comes to mining üòÅ

[31-Aug-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> VerusHash is CPU-optimized, that is what I like to say. CPUs mine it best. There exist some un-released GPU miners for VerusHash, but they perform worse that CPU miners, and are not compatible with using risers and you cannot CPU+GPU mine at the same time. So GPU mining Verus is pretty much not a good idea

[31-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and building an ASIC to do VerusHash faster than a recent CPU would cost bajillions of dollars

[31-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that is why CPUs are so good. VerusHash leverages what CPUs do best, by using AES/AVX CPU instructions

[31-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> VerusHash rests on decades of Intel/AMD research to make CPUs as powerful and cheap as possible. It will be a long time until VerusHash ASICs make sense, but one day they could

[31-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I lean toward VerusHash for BTCH, even as somebody who has a z9 in the mail. The process of buying a z9, the cost, the international customs and taxes, .... , it's not something the masses have access to. CPU mining with VerusHash just seems a lot more "fair", in the sense that everybody has to use the same hardware. You can't buy hw that is exponentially better than the average person can. That levels things

[31-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think it will be cool to have Hush mineable via ASICs and then BTCH CPU-mineable, it will give us quite a cross-section of miners, people can choose either or

[31-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i also have plans to port the Hush webminer to be a BTCH webminer. VerusHash is much friendlier to webmining

[31-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i already have a prototype that can mine KMD or some asset chain in the browser, what's left is to port the current WebAssembly from Equihash to VerusHash. If anybody wants to help, let me know üòÉ

[31-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto  It will be fine, if BTCH realizes the conceived, HUSH + BTCH will cover the whole spectrum of miners and Hodlers. Universality is a big plus. Taking into account the work of your team, how much time will it take to accomplish BTCH mining?

[31-Aug-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't have any timelines. It's not going to be tomorrow or next week, I can tell you that. The lead dev of Veruscoin is working on submitting a PR to Komodo that adds VerusHash, when that happens, we will be able to create the new chain. We also need to allow some time to tell the community when the hardfork is, i.e. a specific block height, and give our exchanges some notice for them to update

[31-Aug-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I do agree that as much transparency in this new fork of BTCH is best, so I will make some kind of "list of all the things that need to happen to create the BTCH fork" on github, and that will hopefully give a lot more insight into exactly where we are

[31-Aug-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: BTCH will become a CPU-friendly coin (same algo as VRSC), and also ~50% of block reward will go to those staking BTCH in their full node. It will continue to have 51% attack protection from KMD, and the new fork will be able to do cryptoconditions (smart contracts). BTCH will not be profitable to mine on GPUs or ASICs for a long time, if ever

[31-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think the reason we see BTCH price climbing is that people rightly realize that BTCH will become something like a bond, where it pays out X% via staking rewards, based on how much you are staking and the total amount being staked on the network at that time. This same thing happened in the VRSC community very early on, but they had almost no circulating supply so the market dynamics won't be exactly the same.

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto I understand you perfectly, this process is not fast. We (hodlers) will wait ). BTCH is moving in the absolutely correct direction, I'm sure with such data the project will be successful, the main thing is not to stop at the achieved

[02-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> Actually I've never understand why dev team effort for meaningless project(BTCH). Cause Hush  NG was quite good idea.

[02-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> I prefer give all effort to implement this idea instead of no purpose project BTCH.

[02-Sep-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Effort does not only go to one coin. Both are being worked on, BTCH is  a runtime fork of Komodo, meaning it inherits upgrades that the Komodo team implements. Yes, we are looking at revamping some features of BTCH, but it doesn't mean all effort goes to one coin.

[02-Sep-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> there is more effort spent on discussing BTCH that actually spent developing BTCH code. this is because BTCH is a runtime fork of KMD

[02-Sep-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and since most of the people discussing BTCH futures are not coding it, these are parallel resources

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @jl777c I understand you, it looks like folk coins will be VRSC and BTCH)

[03-Sep-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes CPU coins are arguably a lot more decentralized as most people dont have GPU or ASIC, but a miner (of whatever type) needs to stay current with tech. It is not the responsibilty of a coin to protect investments in any particular generation of mining gear.

[03-Sep-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @jl777c Yes, for a coin (project) it is important first of all to achieve the stated goal which it declared, usefulness, manufacturability and innovation, mining is just one of the tools for attracting investments. For me, it is surprising to this day that Komodo with such technologies is so inexpensive, an excellent investment.

[dscrd-hush] <exile13> Is there any info available on running a ‚Äònode‚Äô on the hush network? I cannot seem to locate any...I.e. wallet requirements, uptime required and such. Or am I ahead of the curve? 
I‚Äôve been researching crypto for some time now, and am learning Linux. My background is graphics and reiki. I do not think that being ‚ÄòASIC resistant‚Äô supports ‚Äòdecentalization‚Äô because some central company somewhere created a device to do a certain thing. GPUs, cpus, any unit has to be created, therefore materials and labor must be combined to produce a certain outcome. Is nature open source? Perhaps in knowledge or sensory data, yet the physical boundaries are finite. In this respect energy cannot be taken that does not exist. The 50-60 cycle hz that most of our electricity in the cities run, lose power over distance and do not allow effective charge compression. 
I believe that my money really is in jimmies house, and Eric‚Äôs, Rubin is investing with it , and Mira is pay for her college tuition with it. I did not come into this world alone, or have I learned much from only reflection, because we are here together, as a result of everything we have seen heard and experienced. That‚Äôs why I like block chain and crypto.
Much love
