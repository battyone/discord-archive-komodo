[dscrd-hush] <denio> Thanks!

[18-Aug-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i guess Hush just sponsored 10% of 1st prize 😉

[18-Aug-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I will adjust the winning prices 😉

[18-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> All possible donation goes 1on1 in the pricepool

[18-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Maybe we can attract some esportlers for Hush

[18-Aug-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Interesting, when you put a comma (,) immediately after hush it does a double donation

[18-Aug-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> must try 3 and 4 comma's

[18-Aug-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> !tip @denio 1 hush, test1, test2, test3, test4, test5

[18-Aug-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @ITM sent @denio 1.00 HUSH and 1.00 HUSH (≈ 1.00 HUSH + 1.00 HUSH = **2.00 HUSH** ≈ $0.07).

[18-Aug-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so just a comma 😦

[18-Aug-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> !tip @denio 1 hush,,,,

[18-Aug-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @heguli97 sent @denio 1.00 HUSH, 1.00 HUSH, 1.00 HUSH, 1.00 HUSH and 1.00 HUSH (≈ 1.00 HUSH + 1.00 HUSH + 1.00 HUSH + 1.00 HUSH + 1.00 HUSH = **5.00 HUSH** ≈ $0.18).

Urban Dictionary: fuck up some comma's
Spend an obscene amount of money. Blow through so much dough to the point that it must be in the thousands to use at least one comma in the number of digits, as in $10K is $10,000.00 (that would be fuckin up ONE comma, now image what it'd be like to Fuck up some comma's). So ...

[18-Aug-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's quite appropriate 😅

[18-Aug-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not much time for code today, real life! And enjoying summer is important too.... But I have a nice little update

[18-Aug-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I made awesome progress on getting details shielded stats

[18-Aug-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> now when I tip am going to:  amount want to tip  = 1 hush x comma's

[18-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e. every full node can keep track of all the good stats, like "% of shielded transactions" and all that

[18-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM 😉

[18-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> James made me realize, this should be called a new `-zindex=1` CLI option

[18-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just like `txindex` and `spentindex`, Hush just invented the `zindex` (soon to be shared with all KMD chains)

[18-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto looking at the code, don't the full node need to reindex?

[18-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The PR is getting big already! But it mostly works

[18-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM correct, i didn't write any of that code yet 😉

[18-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am getting all the stats to be correct first, before doing config file/CLI option stuff

[18-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto I test when you done 🙂

[18-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some stats still have zeros, because I need to resync with a new block index, ignore those for now

[18-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> look at the bottom

[18-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
  "shielded_only": {
    "fully_shielded_tx_percent": 0.005524861878453038,
    "shielding_tx_percent": 0.4677716390423573,
    "deshielding_tx_percent": 0.536279926335175,
    "fully_shielded_payments_percent": 0,
    "shielding_payments_percent": 0,
    "deshielding_payments_percent": 0
  }
```

[18-Aug-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that means "46.7% shielding, 53% deshielding, 0.5% fully shielded transactions" for Hush, in the last 30 days, when only looking at shielded transactions

[18-Aug-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> making things add up to 100% is not really possible, and the z2z number needs to be subtracted from the other percentages. Lots of little things, but the code does seem to work, and gives so many stats

[18-Aug-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all the "rates" are in per/second

[18-Aug-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "shielded_paymentrate": 0.001048498827538829, means 3.75 zxtns/hour on the Hush chain, on average, over the last 30 days

[18-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is the first time we have ever had any real statistics

[18-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Compared to a total of 42 xtns/hour that the Hush chain does in total (including zxtns)

[18-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so much data

[18-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you can call this RPC, giving it any number of blocks. The default # of blocks is 30 days

[18-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so, have fun y'all!

[18-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX things are coming down the line ^^^

[18-Aug-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so u can have any number of days?
What if I want daily, weekly, monthly, yearly? (I know I could store it in database daily)

[18-Aug-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM you give the RPC the amount of blocks in the "window"

[18-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Arguments:
1. nblocks   (numeric, optional) Number of blocks in averaging window.
2. blockhash (string, optional) The hash of the block which ends the window.

[18-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM so you can ask for stats like "the 30 days before and including this block"

[18-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very powerful, allows looking at history in a sliding window

[18-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or you can change your window size to 1 hour or 1 day/etc

[18-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I keep stats on transactions and payments, of all flavors: Shielding, Deshielding, Full Shielded or any of the previous (Shielded)

[18-Aug-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then you can make so many stats from those basic data points

[18-Aug-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Currently i am wondering if i should keep track of coinbase stuff, otherwise it's not possible to isolate that data, or subtract it out, which could give some interesting numbers

[18-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> % shielded is always going to be a low %, if you count all taddr coinbase

[18-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If somebody can think of a stat they want to see, let me know!!!!

[18-Aug-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> played around with the tip bot a little bit and it looks like the limit is 67 commas, after that it wouldn't send out the message anymore, maybe with making the message shorter in other ways (username, tip amount) you could achieve a larger number of , commas 😃

[18-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @heguli97 1 goat,,,,,

[18-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @dukeleto sent @heguli97 1.00 GOAT, 1.00 GOAT, 1.00 GOAT, 1.00 GOAT, 1.00 GOAT and 1.00 GOAT (≈ 1.00 GOAT + 1.00 GOAT + 1.00 GOAT + 1.00 GOAT + 1.00 GOAT + 1.00 GOAT = **6.00 GOAT** ≈ $0.0081).

[18-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I told everyone, if price below $0.03 even if all the hush was sold it will be grab extremely quick. Price of below 0.03 will never last more then 12 hours.

[18-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> nice thing its extremely profitable for miners, so healthy for network if hashrate grows to 5MH/s+. With notary no worry about the 51% attack. Just low hashrate causes quick raise and a hug lag beween times. over 5MH/s the times between blocks is more smooth.
