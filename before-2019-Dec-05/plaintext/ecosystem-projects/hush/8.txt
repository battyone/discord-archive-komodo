[dscrd-hush] <MrWrong> like other said

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> This roadmap is from around March and i think it holds somewhat true http://myhush.org/roadmap/HUSH_graphic-background_1000x1500_05march2018.png

[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Okay pay day just around the corner, HUSH is still alive right? Not just BTCH? Very tempting at these prices.

[13-Sep-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yes, I'm very tempted to buy more as well.

[13-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Okay lets be degenerates and do it

[13-Sep-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> ill buy over the weekend

[13-Sep-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> at the moment I have an open order to buy a small part ;P of a bitcoin in order to buy more hush later. I also thought that the weekend will be the best time to buy. ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Sep-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> That's usually the time prices are at their lowest, i'm planning of a few hundred â‚¬ worth of hush

[13-Sep-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> that would be a few thousand hush. ðŸ‘Œ

[13-Sep-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Lol @MOCHO 17 here? ;-).. hi man, nice to see you around.

[13-Sep-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I assume that the price for the last week so dropped because the z9 miners do not keep HUSH and immediately sell, pay attention, when HUSH used to decrease in the price the number of coins was larger, now it does not happen, the complexity of the network does not fall, the GPU does not exist at all sense to extract. This is 100% selling ASIC miners, they lack

[13-Sep-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> It was the ASIC miners that lowered the price of Electroneum to the bottom, only the transition to  the ASIC resistance stopped the further fall

[13-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> Well itâ€™s on support vs BTC on the weekly and daily, showing positive div on the daily

[13-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Discouraging to be able to triple my bags with like 1/10th the price of my last investment, butttt ðŸ˜‰

[13-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> I've got z9 minis and I think anyone selling hush is nuts. If market makers are selling hush, it's because they want to accumulate it dirt cheap, y'all.

[13-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Chewy> @Spuddyminer   Mind if I DM you about your z9's

[13-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> I'm ready. My body is ready

[13-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> I mean, sure.

[13-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Oh man... it seems like the yesterday when Hush was touching like $20 (and I saw it in real-time) and I kept on hodling thinking it can pull out ZCL $200 pump. Bad decision back then but I'm glad I can average down right now at current dirt cheap price. Hush Messenger is something unique and an eye should be kept on it.

[13-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I was out at $12, but not kicking myself for that call ðŸ˜‰

[13-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But I re-entered at $3 and again at $1 and $0.39

[13-Sep-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But who times the bottom perfectly every time? ðŸ˜›

[13-Sep-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Raja_MBZ If HUSH was on Bittrex, it would have reached $ 200, Cryptopia did not have such volumes

[13-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Yeah, I realized that after the fork lol @Takoy_Nahal

[13-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> You gotta scale your pump expectations to the size of the exchange I guess. I mean I've never done it I hold onto coins like a moron, but that's what I hear ðŸ˜†

[13-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Spuddyminer> I held zec at 700

[13-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> BTW, it was not a fork, it was an airdrop. XD

[13-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Raja_MBZ You are not alone ,same thing happens with me)

[13-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> I still remember that @TheTrunk line

[13-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> @Takoy_Nahal Well let's continue to average down ðŸ˜‰

[13-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Raja_MBZ No problem, i mined and bought it for low price)

[13-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Man, I remember it like yesterday..

[13-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I stayed up all night to fix the trust that we didn't pull out a scam

[13-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> kept messaging on discord, reddit and twitter

[13-Sep-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> people where freaking out after they shut down the server and no body could access their funds

[13-Sep-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Yeah, and Hush's Discord was deleted too that time... ;')

[13-Sep-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> yeah they made this one then

[13-Sep-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Good old days

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> When hush makes it big in the future, there's lots of material for a book at least, so much drama ðŸ˜†

[14-Sep-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> When that was all happening the price was skyrocketing because of the airdrop though

[14-Sep-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I was super confused at the time, because I was hearing all of the negative press and just kept seeing the price rising, which is why I pulled out at about half the ATH

[15-Sep-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> @Berg  if I'm not mistaken there were once money collected for bittrex listing - about 3BTC. Are they still in the fund ?

[15-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @passcombo.com there was around 0.9 btc collected already and people were prepared to donate up to 3.6 btc once it was confirmed if i recall correctly

[15-Sep-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i'm not sure what happened to that 0.9 btc, all i know is a member called Jivebuddha posted a spreadsheet file about it on hush slack.

[15-Sep-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> and that was over a year ago

[15-Sep-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> I was reffering to what I think was ann like year ago on KMD slack, not sure I remember correctly

[15-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> but it seems like there was 3BTC and the problem was bittrex policy changes or sth

[15-Sep-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> could've been the same fund i'm talking about

[15-Sep-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> but I doubt bittrrex will add cheap low cap coin, untill Hush will have some serious stuff finished

[15-Sep-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> bittrex seems to be one of the more reasonable exchanges, they like to list unique projects with unique features

[15-Sep-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i've heard they look for POW coins too

[15-Sep-18 07:10 AM] ph03nix#3115
as long as they know your chicken it's all good

[15-Sep-18 07:19 AM] ph03nix#3115
who cares about bittrex and poloniex nowadays anyways

[15-Sep-18 07:20 AM] ph03nix#3115
volume has dropped significantly since know your chicken

[15-Sep-18 07:27 AM] ph03nix#3115
similar to filesharing in it's early days, it's like playing whack a mole

[15-Sep-18 07:29 AM] ph03nix#3115
the most decentralized (bittorrent) won the file sharing tech

[15-Sep-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> @heguli97  these are perfect words to use when you contact them  ðŸ˜ƒ "reasonable exchange that is searching for unique POW coins"

[15-Sep-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> ph03enix agree on poloniex (1 year of vol drop is too long in crypto), bittrex is still known brand, but keeps loosing ground

[15-Sep-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> to me bittrex is better service (faster) then polo and both seems more secure then other new exchanges (feels that way)

[15-Sep-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Haha, let's wait till hush NG is operational

[15-Sep-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> Will hush implement smart contracts?

[15-Sep-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @youngseies Not likely on HUSH, but the current plan is to enable cryptoconditions (kmd smart contracts) on BTCH in the future

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @passcombo.com Bittrex has never accepted Bitcoin for listings, so I'm not sure where this is coming from. This must've been before my time here.

[15-Sep-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am syncing a Hush full node with all indexes (txindex, address, timestamp, spent) on the dpow branch, on a notary node for further testing. We are getting closer to having protection against double spend attacks on exchanges (aka 51%/consensus attacks), and our code is an example for other coins

[15-Sep-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bar_F1sh_Rel> Miningspeed has dropped support for any coin with greater than 1M hash - probably because it's not profitable enough for them (too few coins found with their user base)

[15-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto  How many Hush coins z9 mined in 24 hours?

[15-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Default z9 frequency is 500, I overclocked mine to 625. So instead of about 10.5 KSol/s default, it gets about 14KSol/s. At current network conditions, that is about 40-45 HUSH per day with a single overclocked z9 mini

[15-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is in a pool, you could also solo mine with your own pool that is just a proxy for your z9 mini

[15-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then you would earn entire blocks, and a z9 mini can find a few blocks per day itself. That avoids the pool fee, but takes time to maintain the solo mining setup

[15-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Many people are mining ZEN with z9 minis, and can cash out at around $6/day before electricity costs. Hush is more like $5/day, but I think Hush is very under-valued currently and I am mining+HODLing for a brighter future. This bear market makes tiny coins like HUSH very over-sold. Even Komodo is at $1 !!!! That is just madness
