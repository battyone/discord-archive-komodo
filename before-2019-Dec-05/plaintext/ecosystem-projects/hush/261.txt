[18-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <1112> Duke since you mentioned experience with browser fingerprinting, i've wanted an answer to this question for a long time. 

If i download a thousand fonts, and each day i install one new font , does my browser fingerprint change?

[18-Oct-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes

[18-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> as long as your browser recognizes new system fonts

[18-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there might be some way where you must enable the font in your browser, but in general, yes, it does

[18-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> same goes with plugins

[18-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you randomly install/de-install plugins, that changes your unique id

[18-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> smart systems are designed to take that into account, tho

[18-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they can say "well, in the space of 2^256 possible hashes, this hash is within 0.000000003% and so, we consider that the same"

[18-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have worked at a place that implemented such a hash

[18-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a hash that is not sensitive to small perturbations

[18-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> small changes in data only give small changes in hash, as opposed to SHA, which gives large output changes for any input

[18-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Security companies use such hashes, which are not good for cryptographic uses

[18-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they want to know "how close is this binary to known malware?" and if it's less then 0.000X %, that is good enough

[18-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 you can fool simple systems, but you would need to drastically change many things in your browser, constantly, to fool a smarter system. Which definitely exist
