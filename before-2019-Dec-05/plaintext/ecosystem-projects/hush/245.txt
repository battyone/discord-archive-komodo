[dscrd-hush] <Tupakito> thank you @dukeleto  ðŸ™‚

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh @halo kitty rules this particular CVE had nothing to do with ITM

[29-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is me reading the commits of ZEC and telling people stuff that they would prefer to keep secret

@ebfull @socrates1024 @ElectricCoinCo I challenge you to release an analysis of Zcash Metadata Leakage CVE-2019-16930. You wrote the vulnerable $ZEC code, I am sure understand it more than me. Please let the world know what I said that was incorrect. https://t.co/kDvbRG6u0Z

Since @ebfull blocked me (I guess he didn't like that I pointed out he wrote the vulnerable $ZEC code?) and that means I can't @tweet_stamp his reply, here it is for the Zcash historians

[29-Sep-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto Both leakages are not related? I guess that means more troubles ahead ðŸ˜„

[29-Sep-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yup, i believe they are totally different vulnerabilities

[29-Sep-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @halo kitty rules Totally unrelated. My focus Linkage between chains(complete proofing + tested, busy with a full POC) and Secondly Estimate amounts.
The bug that was fix was related to IP address and couple of other information related to z-addresses.

[29-Sep-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> you hvae to remeber...duke exposed a vulnerability in hush as well....so its good to see the transparency

[29-Sep-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> even if its  a negative for the coin

[29-Sep-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would rather people pause and worry that every zaddr on every Zcash protocol coin was insecure, and maybe be wrong, than what Electric Coin Company wanted: only a few people to know this and everybody else to be kept in the dark.

[29-Sep-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash doesn't make emergency releases changing deep internals with no tests/docs for no reason!!!!!

[29-Sep-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So that is evidence itself

[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> He was devastated

[29-Sep-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Electric Coin Company sounds like the Sears Roebuck of crypto

[29-Sep-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[29-Sep-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Outdated

[29-Sep-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they were forced to change it from Zcash Company

[29-Sep-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for legal reasons and to reduce litigation potential and probably other shady reasons

[29-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> And now they're arguing over the trademark

[29-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a swiss-based company with a us-based subsidiary and a non-profit to reduce taxes

[29-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and they treat everybody like total garbage

[29-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Sep-19 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ill be on the Metaverse Metadata attack like a rash

[29-Sep-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Maybe we should do an article on the obvious turning a blind eye, to the ip leakage of private txs

[29-Sep-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Duke is the only one to speak up

[29-Sep-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> This is huge.

[29-Sep-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Maybe it's just me

[29-Sep-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> sure, we can do that

[29-Sep-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> a prelude to bigger troubles

[29-Sep-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Yeah

[29-Sep-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Well that's the truth

[29-Sep-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> The MM attack will bring the doors dowm

[29-Sep-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> They tried to sweep this one under the rug

[29-Sep-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Like oh, no big deal, just ip address leakage on private txs

[29-Sep-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Wtf

[29-Sep-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > They tried to sweep this one under the rug

[29-Sep-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> they did? this is proven?

[29-Sep-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> No

[29-Sep-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i gotta b careful what i say

[29-Sep-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Let me ask u this

[29-Sep-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Where was the vulnerability described?

[29-Sep-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> by duke i assume, i dont know the details yet and have to re-read stuff. just dont want the ECC to use their last 1000 bucks to sue me

[29-Sep-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Okay let me back track

[29-Sep-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> gimme another ðŸ™‚

[29-Sep-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> So they have a vulnerability that exposes ip addresses

[29-Sep-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> can we prove they new the IP leak and did nothing about it till Leto arrived?

[29-Sep-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> I'm not trying to point the finger

[29-Sep-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Like u said that's dangerous

[29-Sep-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Maybe more of a take on how something like this should be announced

[29-Sep-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> I'm sorry. I know certain type of writing is dangerous.

[29-Sep-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> So I'm trying to turn it around & show a way that....

[29-Sep-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> I'll get back with u  @gigamesh

[29-Sep-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
