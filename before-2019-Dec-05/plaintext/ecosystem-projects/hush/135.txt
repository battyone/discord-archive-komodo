[26-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 and your screenshot points out a bug!! My "next halving" code doesn't take into account that you might still be syncing, it's actually wrong in your screenshot

[26-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it just uses the current block height

[26-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> no matter if is on a windows wallet or an exchange ?

[26-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> R or Z

[26-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you have a 't' address you need to convert to the new chain

[26-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Use the pinned message in #wallet-support as a guide

[26-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin valid Hush addresses start with `zs1`, `R`, or very rarely, `b` (multisig)

[26-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kaks click the "Memo" button in Silent Dragon to add a message to your transaction, up to 512 bytes currently

[26-Jun-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Later it will have support for sending larger memos automatically in multiple transactions with a higher fee?
