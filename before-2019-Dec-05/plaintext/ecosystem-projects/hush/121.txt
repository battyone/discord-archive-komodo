[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> who controls the privkeys of the deposited coins?

[14-Jun-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what they say above can be said about proxy DEX, but the proxy gateway controls the privkeys to the actual coins, not the user

How to tell if something is decentralized
There seem to be many projects now claiming to be decentralized. In the past, the community was far more vocal about clear imposters, but‚Ä¶

[14-Jun-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Exactly how it works.. have to test and see once its out.. now its all hype üòÄ

[14-Jun-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> But if it works and the matching engine can handle huge transactions and user control the keys.. it can be huge

[14-Jun-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RK> @kh4567 it can be bigger than binance

[14-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Binance can be hacked.... so good to see some new players who can make things safer üòÄ

[14-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> And I think with trade war btw USA vs china.. its hard for binance to exist in US

[14-Jun-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RK> Yes right true

[14-Jun-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> So it is trying to solve the main problem : hackers !

[14-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Dex is the future of exchanges ...the exchange , wallets now all can be hacked

[14-Jun-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> And there is no insurance coverage for crypto

[14-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Unless there is a crypto custodian , insurance can be given to the cold storage wallet

[14-Jun-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> The hot wallet no insurance company will insured that üòÄ

[14-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> So i look at that video again..  @7.13  : fabio said.. "u can do cross chain as if u are doing cross chain..
So its like "off chain" , as if u are doing "cross chain" @jl777c

[14-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> this is not technically accurate, it is hype stuff. be careful

[14-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> just because you use magical words, doesnt make it real

[14-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it appears to be a custodial contract that creates onchain tokens and another contract that manages the balances. this is not any cross chain atomic swap

[14-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> morning friends

[14-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Good morning üòÉ

[14-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg welcome to the world, sunshine

[14-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> üåû

[14-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I've applied for a HUSH/KMD trading pair on Graviex, since Verus is listed with one üòÉ

[14-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hopefully since our volume has been pretty healthy that they toss it our way for free

[14-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What's the best way to convert to fiat?  Coinbase?

[14-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Bitpay?

[14-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Haven't really sold any crypto in years

[14-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> depends on what you're converting

[14-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> side note: at least if you use a CEX it's not a 100% guarantee that a company that's making bank off you (like as if you used Bitpay)

[14-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Cex?

[14-Jun-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What do you use?

[14-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I might be playing with the devil himself but I use Coinbase to convert to fiat

[14-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yes.  I use coinbase.  But just seeing if there were other options

[14-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I use coinbase only because it was how I started in crypto and they already know my chickens

[14-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Unrelated to hush but congrats to all Canadians in our discord for the Raptors Championship!!! ü§òüèΩ

[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> good afternoon

[14-Jun-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> It's too bad that it's too late to collect those good airdrops

[14-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There may or may not be an airdrop in #tipbot_general currently

[14-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Multiple lottos and airdrops going on in #tipbot_general

[14-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 3 lottos going on currently and some airdrops, look for pinned messages

[14-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <yefuchen> @Berg 
The smaller lotteries is a great idea...!!!

[14-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <yefuchen> now more people will be able to participate!!!

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It was duke's idea üòÉ

[14-Jun-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Although the 50 HUSH one was a fluke, so it looks like its just me vs duke for the big bets üòõ

[15-Jun-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that was actually the first language I ever really learned, and it's not common to see these days

[15-Jun-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> unclear how it actually uses the blockchain, it's not using Zcash protocol that I can see

[15-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's interesting to see competitors in the space, that means there is a market that wants solutions to these kinds of problems

[15-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @BaBa WhiteSheep Hush will be optimized for sharing small and medium sized files, and it will be purposefully expensive to store very large files, because that can be used as an attack method. For large files, we can store IPFS or bittorrent URLs inside of encrypted memo fields.

[15-Jun-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the size of small/medium/large has not been finalized, but small means "less than 200KB" and medium means "less than 4MB"

[15-Jun-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for now

[15-Jun-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> images and PDFs and files you would email, that is what Hush will be optimized for

[15-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> 4MB for say a Will document in the form of PDF should be enough. There will be exceptions though.

[15-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 4MB is our block size

[15-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can store more than 1 block worth, we can store larger files

[15-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but at some point, if you want to upload a 2GB file every day or something like that, you use up all transaction space

[15-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very similar to the Sapling Woodchipper

[15-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is not BitTorrent

[15-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> block space is precious, but we want people to store reasonable sized files and then references to larger files

[15-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't want your 10GB of porn on the Hush blockchain, no matter how curated and hi-def it is

[15-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 20MB or 40MB might be a reasonable limit to prevent abuse. we need to find what works

[15-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Other than UHD video, what kind of messages would people be sending that would take up gigabytes? lol
