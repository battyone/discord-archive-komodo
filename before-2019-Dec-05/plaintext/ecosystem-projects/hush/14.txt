[dscrd-hush] <cipi> very low volume, indeed... but i haven't done it to make money, i just wanted to have orderbook entries for all the coins that are on BarterDEX

[24-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> in the future i will let the people who issued the coins to play marketmaker for their coins

[24-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> and only do it for some bigger coins myself

[24-Sep-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> how much time coding was needed for what you have now?

[24-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> you mean for the price update script? not that much, couple of hours... and i have to say that i am not a developer, just a unix sysadmin playing with bash and perl :_)

[24-Sep-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> I ment all of it 😃

[24-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> PS do you also store CMC values / kind of log ?

[24-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> i haven't done any work towards the arbitrage script yet :-)
no, i don't store the prices from cmc, but BarterDEX does... in ~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/PRICES... but i haven't used them and don't know the details (maybe i should)

[24-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> oh, setting up a BarterDEX node for playing marketmaker is not that much work... most of the work is maintenance for the wallets of all the coins
btw, i have a short and simple script for setting up such a node (including ERC20-support): http://pad.supernet.org/bob-erc20

[24-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> half of the script is about compiling KMD wallet and configuring KMD and ETOMIC (for the erc20-coins) 😉

[24-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> Is the cmc price real

[24-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <obul312> ?

[24-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> ^no i dont believe it is

[24-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FYI that link and URL has nothing to do with Hush, CMC is very confused. /cc @Berg . It's broken, which I am not sure is good or bad

[24-Sep-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> such tiny volume, prices will be very volatile, as I said

[24-Sep-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hey, our market cap is above 1M again! sweet

[24-Sep-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Owe> Hey, I just want to inform you that Hush now has a proper mobile wallet! You can speak and transact freely on both Android and iOS utilising Hush network within zelcore (formelly zeltrez). https://zelcore.io/#download

[24-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <finrecon> Is there a place where i can examine source code for your zelcore wallet?

[24-Sep-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZelTrez is not supported nor an official wallet. It concerns me greatly that it is not open source

[24-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so Hush and this discord has nothing to do with that, and does not support it

[24-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Owe please don't spam for Zelcore in here, we don't support non-open source wallets

[24-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Owe> Sorry for actually doing anything for Hush community but your rules. Cheers

[24-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It's been requested by literally any community member who expresses interest in your product to be able to examine the source code. It's not like we're hiring actors to grill you guys. The community wants open source as well. We aren't going to risk reputation and peddle a closed source wallet that may steal from users.

[24-Sep-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Is this a wallet from Zelcash?

[24-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> never put any more than test amounts to a closed source wallet

[24-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You heard it from the man himself.

[24-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> LEt's just say if you got no other choice now then u can use closed source

[24-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> but maybe soon there will be mobile Agama? 😃

[24-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> actually wait .. there is Agama web wallet somewhere, and that should have Hush, not sure if mobile friendly, but should be possible to use on mobile anyway

[24-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Aww common duke. ZelCore aint that bad of a wallet. Good mobile option for Hush, and relatively trustworth devs. Tons of multi-token wallets arn't open source like Jaxx or Exodus.

[24-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> Im holding some of my Hush in Zelcore

[24-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <badenglishtea> On that note, when is Hush back to $20?

[24-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Possibly today if the right trade goes through on Coinroom 😉

[24-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dog-_-> well there is no volume 😮

[24-Sep-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Oh I see on Cryptopia there are 200 confirmations on HUSH, check your old deposits and see it

[24-Sep-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> it's happening right now

[24-Sep-18 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Takoy_Nahal Cryptopia back online?

[24-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I received correspondence from their wallet team that they would implement changes we requested.

[24-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Didn't get a timeline for reactivating.

[24-Sep-18 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> No trades yet, but the number of confirmations is increasing

[25-Sep-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigoplast> i have a question about secrity TLS (Configuring Hush for secure peer-to-peer connections) according to https://github.com/MyHush/hush/blob/master/SECURE_SETUP.md . Do i need to get noip or ddns or similar for geting the node running and secring with TLS with a Public Domain ?

[dscrd-hush] <gigoplast> sorry if is not the right place

[25-Sep-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigoplast> i have hush installed on my desktop linux mint 19 64bit  and i have a raspberrypi 3 [Raspbian stretch]  running on same router, in rpi3 i have installed noip & i created a local vpn server/client , in my desktop the client running perfect no problem with connection , bref on my hush node is it possible to configuring a s that [rpi3=FQDN ---> localVPN----> my Desktop-pc=hushd]
The localVPN  was before = for navigation mater i created for securing  my connection on the web
so my Desktop-pc connect throug a rpi3 by vpn on same public ip
so my public ip it's the some but more secured
with a vpn encription

[25-Sep-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> still a few things to figure out, but Hush notarizations are happening!

[25-Sep-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> So it's official, hush is now notarized?

[25-Sep-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Although being notarized, we still need to wait for exchanges and pools to update for it to be realllyyy official 😉

[25-Sep-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> So if we run a Node we should update? Have i to use the Dpow branche?

[25-Sep-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> Do we have to update our wallets?

[25-Sep-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there will be a release soon, then is the time for most people to update. If you use our Git repo, then you can use the `dev` branch to get the latest code

[25-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoPope> Want to start mining this coin.

[25-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoPope> Recommendation for best wallet application ?

[25-Sep-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoPope> Any idea how long Cryptopia will take to fix issue?

[25-Sep-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @CryptoPope Welcome, I would recommend the web wallet as it's fast(you don't need to sync it) and easy to use, just remember to make a strong passphrase and write it down EXACTLY as you typed it in, also backup the private key(s) for the address(es) you're going to use in a safe place in case you misplace/misspell your passphrase. https://wallet.myhush.org/

[25-Sep-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoPope> @heguli97 thanks for the info ...

[25-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoPope> Any idea how long Cryptopia will take to fix issue?

[25-Sep-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I can't give you an exact date, but i don't think they will open trading until a new wallet version is released, which is soon and then maybe a few days for cryptopia to get it up and running

[25-Sep-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoPope> Ok thanks again

[25-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cryptojon> so where can i buy hush right now?

[25-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> coinroom, tradesatoshi, digitalprice, cratex

[25-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cryptojon> ta

[25-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Cryptopia should be back online in the near future

[25-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> AH, there we go... Man, I've been sending messages all over the place and just noticed that they've all been grayed out.

[25-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Thought everyone was ignoring me 😅

[25-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoPope> Another quick question.. is the swing wallet advisable to use at the moment?

[25-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yes you can use it too :). I use the swing wallet as my main wallet, hush-swing-v0.71.3b-hush-v1.0.13-windows-x64.zip to be exact.

[25-Sep-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Swing wallet is stable/advisable, and if you are willing to "use the source", hush-ng is very nice and has translations for many languages: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng

[dscrd-hush] <JT> Why is barterdex showing hush at 0.00?

[26-Sep-18 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JT> Is hush really that devalued on the decentralized exchanges?

[26-Sep-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kaddycrypto> Why cryptopia is down ? It's been days the exchange is not supporting coins transactions... Any update .. pls share

[26-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> @kaddycrypto  as far as I understand cryptopia is waiting for a new release coming out pretty soon which supports KMD notarization for HUSH. 😀

[26-Sep-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BarterDEX LP is paused (that is what cipi was talking about in the backlog, cipi runs all the servers for BarterDEX, including for Hush). Because of big price spikes, people were gaming the system and dumping coins on BarterDEX. So Barter DEX Liquidity Provider (LP) is paused

[26-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @kaddycrypto they are having issues..https://mobile.twitter.com/Cryptopia_NZ

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Does anyone have an answer for gigoplast in #wallet-support? Over my head 😁

[26-Sep-18 03:27 PM] NedBGQ#8462
why is hush not available in agama

[26-Sep-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It is, you have to navigate to settings and turn on experimental settings

[26-Sep-18 03:31 PM] NedBGQ#8462
hm, do you mean "advanced settings"

[26-Sep-18 03:31 PM] NedBGQ#8462
"advanced features"

[26-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> This is from memory, but yes I believe so.

[26-Sep-18 03:32 PM] NedBGQ#8462
ok, lemme try

[26-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you tool around in there I'm sure you'll find the 'experimental settings'

[26-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Or

[26-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> 'Experimental Features"

[26-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I believe is the name of it.

[26-Sep-18 03:37 PM] NedBGQ#8462
yeah, have been looking but was unable to find anything else other than "advanced features". changed it to enabled, but HUSH is not to be found in the dropdown menu for adding coins. btch is there, which confused me a bit

[26-Sep-18 03:40 PM] NedBGQ#8462
have restarted multiple times, after saving the new settings, but neither native not spv mode lists hush 😢

[26-Sep-18 03:41 PM] NedBGQ#8462
btw, I'm using the latest agama 42c

[26-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hmmm. If nobody else gets an answer in here before I get home from work I'll look into it further for you and try to get an answer.

[26-Sep-18 03:41 PM] NedBGQ#8462
thanks, I appreciate it, cheers

[26-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> There's been a lot of talk about that issue in here, so it's weird that you can't find any kind of "experimental settings/features" to toggle

[26-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Because to my knowledge everyone who has had the question has had it resolved, hoping someone chimes in to clarify, but if not I'll come back and @ you later today.

[26-Sep-18 03:43 PM] NedBGQ#8462
hey no problem, I will take a look around in the chat

[26-Sep-18 03:44 PM] NedBGQ#8462
I've found it, all good - thanks for your fast support!!

[26-Sep-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Glad I could kind of help 😃

[26-Sep-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <NedBGQ> you might have to fully uninstall Agama and then re-install

[26-Sep-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you had an old version of Agama, sometimes the files it leaves behind mess stuff up. Like an old agama without Hush, and then you upgraded to one *with* Hush
