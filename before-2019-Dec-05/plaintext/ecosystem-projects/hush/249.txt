[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @RunningMantheCoin don't spend it all in one place

[01-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I see.  But btch and hush are like tightly knit coins

[01-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX free listing period is over

[01-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Was hoping for 2 for 1

[01-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <folgory.com> yes, is last coin Hush sorry

[01-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX see #btch and help get BTCH listed on AtomicDEX, that is where you can help most

[01-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @folgory.com how many confirmations do you use for Hush deposits/withdrawals?

[01-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if you could tell us your Hush deposit/withdraw/trade fees, that would be awesome

[01-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <folgory.com> @dukeleto we have added fast deposit

[01-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <folgory.com> 1 confirmation

[01-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @folgory.com I would change that to 2 so your exchange is protected from double spend attacks by DPoW: https://komodoplatform.com/delayed-proof-of-work/

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @folgory.com you best set this up for any KMD related asset protected by dPOW, not sure there is a list but Arrr has dPOW same as Hush

[01-Oct-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <folgory.com> Arrr is different work with z address

[01-Oct-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Oct-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @dukeleto @AkiraX AtomicDEX is now asking for $7,500 in BTC or KMD to list BTCH

[01-Oct-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> üëÄ

[01-Oct-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> maybe Chainswap is the better choice then...?Or have they listing fees too?

[01-Oct-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I've messages James directly

[01-Oct-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Honestly, does BTCH need an exchange at this stage? I would argue it doesn't. In the last few months was volume several thousands BTCH. Alltogether! Periodes of few weeks without a single trade were common. I've made several trades (at 500 sats) with myself just to keep market artificially alive. So no, at this stage BTCH does not need exchange necessarily.

[01-Oct-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But will the project ever realistically be revived?

[01-Oct-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> That's the conversation to be had...

[01-Oct-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Who knows... But coin/project doesn't need an exchange, I guess.

[01-Oct-19 05:45 PM] phm87#7395
I think that we can add btch on atomicddx ourselves. As I understood, we can run our own infra. Something similar to pirate onboarding can be cool

[01-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Chainswap charging 2k$ @Berg

[01-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, they just quoted me the same üòì

[01-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> RIP BTCH for now

[01-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Let's make  otc BTCH chat on Discord... Maybe we can add BTCH later to atomicdex or similar

[01-Oct-19 05:54 PM] phm87#7395
Another idea: if there are no markets at all, a price can still be defined in OTC or a price can be calculated based on hashrate. If we add btch on a pool such as zpool.ca, miners can ask to be paid in btch and mine other cryptos. Huge problem is liquidity because pool won'tbuy coins: it sells everything to btc. Miners that ask to be paid in alts will only receive coins mined but not sold. I tested it successfully on a testpool (I prefilled the wallet).

[01-Oct-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> BTCH has mining on demand or? Also the mining reward is rly small...Good idea but maybe don't fit for BTCH @phm87

[01-Oct-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> - do test swap on AtomicDEX with BTCH
- add swap data as proof: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/swaps/DEX-KMD.md
- add `"mm2": 1` to https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L2169

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> People are selling for almost 0. I bought additional 3000 BTCH today. That is insane. @Berg Does the team have a R-addr for public donations? Tell  people to donate rather than sell for 0. And as I see everybody is affected with ÀùpriceÀù rather than with a ÀùvolumeÀù. Would it help your emotions if I put a tiny wall of 0.1 BTC higher? Wold 300 sats make it better? Only a small number of addresses can break that tiny wall... üòÑ

[01-Oct-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I am not rly sure you should use coinexchange...

[01-Oct-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> In this situation withdraw your funds is better then deposit new funds I think

[01-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @denio BTC is already there. So far I can't complain about coinexchange. They were fair the whole time. I can risk that.

[01-Oct-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <phm87> you can install a phone/android emulator, it will emulate a phone with android on it. Maybe it will ask credentials of a Google account to start android (maybe it can be skipped). I forgot the name of the one I used but when I googled, I found several alternatives

[01-Oct-19 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jewelie what kind of issue?

[01-Oct-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jewelie our exchange master is @Berg, not sure if we have talked to Kucoin

[01-Oct-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jewelie> Can't seem to withdraw. Tipbot doesn't respond. Was working when i checked the balance on dm but got no response after I used the $withdraw command and placed the wallet address

[01-Oct-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Why transfer Hush

[01-Oct-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Oct-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Instead of donating to list at an exchange.  How about just buying at a higher price

[02-Oct-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We all know hush should be worth $10

[02-Oct-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Miner reward would go down to like 1 hush a day if price was at $1

[02-Oct-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Oct-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Oct-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They have higher volume than anything we're currently on.

[02-Oct-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But TradeOgre has always been a goal for HUSH. We've yet to have them even acknowledge our existence.. Lots of applications have gone their way, from both us and community members.
