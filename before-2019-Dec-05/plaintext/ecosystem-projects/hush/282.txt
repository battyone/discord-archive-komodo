[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I can read charts

[09-Nov-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I can chart too

[09-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I see a healthy and quick retrace, if met with volume,  could move up significantly more than 1250

[09-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Unless volume continues

[09-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> If we had just .25 btc more volume, it could get crazy

[09-Nov-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Just .08 btc would take us to 1310

[09-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Very nice price

[09-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 that vol is different that what graviex says

[09-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe it's "daily" vs "24hr rolling period"

[09-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in any case, it's all good

[09-Nov-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we gotta keep working on our stuff and get SilentDragonAndroid and HushDroid and the DragonHead out. Can you imagine what that will do to our price? Having actual working code *and* hardware?

[09-Nov-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Yes, I can imagine

[09-Nov-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> HushDroid as it is, is ready.

[09-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Pixel 2, 3, 3a

[09-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need to decide on a new Pixel series, maybe 3?

[09-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't want to be the next thing that gets cut from support

[09-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> True

[09-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We can also do Galaxy S7

[09-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> w/LineageOS

[09-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushDroid also can be a tablet. i have an old tablet with a cracked screen running SDA, just stock android

[09-Nov-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's really nice having more screen for the wallet

[09-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We can get lineage on a tablet

[09-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but i thought lineage was ðŸ’© ?

[09-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well it has microG

[09-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Compared to full gapps

[09-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And it supports everything non pixel

[09-Nov-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crypto99 this CVE is 7.5 years old: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-November/017453.html

[09-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> imagine the hilarity of keeping it secret for 7.5 years, even from Zcash, and then releasing it on a Friday afternoon, lulz

[09-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Holy lol

[09-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> fucking CVEs

[09-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> It was hidden

[09-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> If you seek, you shall find

[09-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is the norm

[09-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> There's not enough people to fix all the bugs out there

[09-Nov-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Good work  @dukeleto

[09-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Hushdroid recommends a Pixel 3a and Graphene. Bc we dont want to limit those seeking a more secure android, that dont want a pixel or cant afford one, we have other options.

[09-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i like that

[09-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> We wont turn anyone away seeking to gain more privacy through their android

[09-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I'll help anyone that I can.

[09-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @Crypto99 50 hush

[09-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tip.cc> :HUSH: @dukeleto sent @Crypto99 **50.00 HUSH** (â‰ˆ $5.39).

[09-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because I have seen him help lots of people and believe he will continue ðŸ™‚

[09-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I think Duke needs Graphene lol

[09-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes i do

[09-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> If anyone thinks this is bs, just come and chat with me. I'll make guides, you tell me, and we will do it

[09-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> HushDroid is only beneficial if we have users

[09-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Doesnt mean you have to buy a phone.

[09-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @dukeleto a lot of secure phones have been scams

[09-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most things with the word "privacy" or "secure" in the name are scams

[09-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Aholes

[09-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I learned this using privacy and security software over 15 years

[09-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And as of today, in crypto, the ZCash protocol,mimblewimble and XMR.

[09-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so much to learn

[09-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> How so

[09-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> how so not?

[09-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i can't even learn all there is about BTC and ZEC protocols and they change every day

[09-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Haha

[09-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> jl777 can code faster than I can even read the code

[09-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> XMR has over 250 forks, zcash around 30 source code forks

[09-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> new coins and protocols come out every day

[09-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> new elliptic curves, new BTC internals

[09-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I read bitcointalk Ann's daily

[09-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> In a telegram channel

[09-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I use privacy as a search filter

[09-Nov-19 01:43 PM] AkiraX#8269

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Do you use your phone for crypto?

[09-Nov-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> just atomicdex

[09-Nov-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> it's been a long time since that happened last, September last year before cryptopia went bust

[09-Nov-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hush and Kmd have been my only two in the green for quite some time

[09-Nov-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It also looks like we might be bringing on a bigger exchange finally. Old discussions re emerging with people seeing us :)

[09-Nov-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Big things in the works

[09-Nov-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If people want in, they're going to have to spend more

[09-Nov-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Push that sell wall up :)

[09-Nov-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> ðŸ˜®

[09-Nov-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> now could be a good time to try and get people to buy from safetrade, txbit and maybe even from folgory

[09-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Altillyyy

[09-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> And TxBit especially

[09-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Because they're both on CMC now

[09-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'll make some announcements trying to get some volume to them
