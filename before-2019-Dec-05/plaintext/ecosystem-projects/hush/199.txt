[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Will just wipe it

[25-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, just backup the wallet.dat

[25-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or don't, if there is nothing in it 🙂

[25-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> somehow you got on a fork, and I am working how in the world you did

[25-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> wiped

[25-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I don't fully understand why your debug.log said progress=100% but the GUI thought it was still activating

[25-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @iceyballz that is basically the lack of a symlink in the right place

[25-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> need to have `komodod` symlinked to the correct binary, in the same directory as SD itself, then it should work

[25-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> ok resyncing

[25-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's explained in the readme, but not well 🙂

[25-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
Emulating the embedded node
In binary releases, SilentDragon will use node binaries in the current directory to sync a node from scratch. It does not attempt to download them, it bundles them. To simulate this from a developer setup, you can symlink these four files in your Git repo:

    ln -s ../hush3/src/hushd
    ln -s ../hush3/src/hush-cli
    ln -s ../hush3/src/komodod
    ln -s ../hush3/src/komodo-cli
The above assumes silentdragon and hush3 git repos are in the same directory. File names on Windows will need to be tweaked.
```

[25-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Will let you know what block it syncs to

[25-Aug-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> groovy!

[25-Aug-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have no idea how you got into the state you did, but most likely not your fault. race condition or intermittent error thing

[25-Aug-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's not easy to test that code, but I have some ideas to make it better

[25-Aug-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For one, I can make the GUI show the last few lines of debug.log, and do things based on the contents

[25-Aug-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Yes, and perhaps not lock out the UI behind that popup window

[25-Aug-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if I see syncing, I can give a diff message than "shite, no peers!"

[25-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to be fair, from the point of view of that code, no RPCs would return any data, so the GUI wouldn't be very useful

[25-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it was wrong in thinking that, but normally, that would be reasonable

[25-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> would be nice to poke around the GUI while that is happening, tho

[25-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is inherited behavior from zecwallet that can change

[25-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Yeah that makes sense, but both options would be nice

[25-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the "hushd" tab will give you more details while syncing

[25-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this also makes me wonder, if I could add a feature that tries to help people decide "Am I on a fork?"

[25-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it could contact the explorer, and compare 2 blocks and make sure they are the same hash, if not => you are probably on a fork

[25-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> That would be great, just compare sync height to explorer height

[25-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, heights could be different from propagation time and network delay

[25-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Ah good point

[25-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but a past block hash should never be different, if it's been notarized

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so we look back at a notarized block and verify the blockhash is the same, otherwise either the explorer or current node is on a fork

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> So you would need to check several items then: current height when at 100%, comparative block hash, etc.

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> might be a useful warning to give

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @iceyballz nope

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Because if the forked chain stopped mining, it's height would not increment??

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the only thing to look at is "a past notarized blockhash"

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Or is it different with dPOW

[25-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which cannot change, via consensus rules

[25-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> forked chains often do not have any notarizations, as well

[25-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Ah ok

[25-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> Still getting up to speed with Komodo's protocol

[25-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> DPoW basically brings blockhash data from HUSH => KMD => BTC

[25-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then all HUSH nodes read that data, and enforce rules via consensus

[25-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so the algo would be "find the last notarized block hash + height, and then verify the same block height has the same blockhash on the explorer. If not, either the explorer or current node is on a fork"

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh the dragon head mold with full node computer inside, and power supply, will be around $200. Finalized pricing is not known, because we still don't know how expensive the dragon head is to produce, but we have an estimate. It takes over 24hrs to 3D print!
