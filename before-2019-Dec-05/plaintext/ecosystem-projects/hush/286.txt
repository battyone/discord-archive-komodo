[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> THERE IS A FAKE/SCAM KOMODO AGAMA WALLET v0.6.0-1 BEING SENT AROUND DIRECTLY TO DISCORD MEMBERS IN DM AS IF IT IS REAL.. WE WILL NEVER DM YOU AN UPDATE MESSAGE, AND THAT IS NOT KOMODO OR VERUS. DO NOT UPDATE TO ANY WALLET UNLESS IT IS ANNOUNCED HERE. THERE IS NO UPDATE YET AVAILABLE FOR THE VERUS OR KOMODO WALLETS. PLEASE LET OTHERS KNOW BEFORE ANYONE GETS CAUGHT BY THIS. The scammers are using a fake KomodoPIatform git hub account, with an upper case "I" instead of an "L".
