[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i would tip you but my jar is empty, will tip you soon üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it will stay at 1 conf for 5-10 minutes, until it's notarized

[26-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then it will jump to something like 5-10 confs, and then go up one-by-one

[26-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what dpowconfs looks like

[26-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once TS enabled deposits+withdrawals, we can announce on Twitter+Blockfolio via the magic of @Berg

[26-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @AkiraX  throw all your hash at zergpool and collect hush

[26-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Don't have to actually mine hush

[26-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It if you collect hush I. Essence you are buying From exchange and mining the top coin

[26-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Which will raise the value of hush

[26-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm putting all my gpus at zergpool and going to collect hush

[26-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto yes, dpow, when notarized it jumped(Exactly the same time and confirmation as explorer notarized) and going up one by one(same time as explorer picks up a block).

[26-Jun-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I added "Next Halving" to the debug screen last night

[dscrd-hush] <!    ‚ô§bErLiNo‚ô§ |HaFeDh|> @dukeletothx

[26-Jun-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so nobody has to trust anybody else, you just look at your full node

[26-Jun-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 516 days until Hush halving!! Mining rewards will drop in half then, and we should see some price action via supply/demand

[26-Jun-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon is SO close to being ready for a wider audience

[26-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if anybody here feels comfortable to compile things on Linux/Windows/Mac, you can be an alpha/beta tester and earn Hush bounties

[26-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's hard to test things across all OS's

[26-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if we find bugs before the binary release, way fewer people will have those problems

[26-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am about to make some source code git tags + releases

[26-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SD is pretty easy to use, once you compile it. It can completely install a fresh Hush full node for you

[26-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or connect to a currently running node

[26-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> pretty cool about the halving, what kind of other cool features have you added too?

[26-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> ooh, Bitcoin over 13k$

[26-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> pff bitcoin is just breaking out every position

[26-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> nice

[26-Jun-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> almost 13.400

[26-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> wonder if we'll see 14.000 and then a reversal to 12k

[26-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In the Help menu of SD, there are links to the Hush website and discord now

[26-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that should help steer users to the right place to get help

[26-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lots of little features like that

[26-Jun-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i added the fiat price in the bottom right

[26-Jun-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and also I added the total fiat value of the wallet on the main balance screen

[26-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TradeSatoshi evidently has HUSH v3 operational, deposits, withdrawals + trading. Go forth and prosper https://tradesatoshi.com/Exchange/?market=HUSH_BTC  :hush_white:

[26-Jun-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jun-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> So finally they got Hush working? Before Christmas too. Wow!

[26-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> One thing we need is more volume on https://www.altilly.com/market/HUSH_BTC.
I will be adding buy orders during the week.

[26-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM very good point, and altilly is on CMC

[26-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Timing for Hush has been good. Another exchange back up with deposits/withdrawals.

[26-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are working hard to get some SilentDragon binaries out

[26-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think that putting a working thing in peoples hands, and seeing people post screenshots of that thing to twitter, is probably the #1 way to increase the price of Hush right now

[26-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Intrinsic value

[26-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I want people to be using Hush for what it is meant to do, the memo field is coming alive, finally

[26-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the memo field is usable in the first release of SD

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's basic, but useful. You can send a full anon memo, or give a reply address

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the GUI has some shortcuts like "right click on address, and an action item like Send Memo appears"

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so 2 way memos are working in this release

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 1 way or 2 way

[26-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But a "chat ui" is not there, that will come in our next release. A UI geared towards chatting versus "sending money with optional messages"

[26-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Not sure if it's reinventing the wheel but I'm tempted to code up a web app in PHP just for the private messaging system using Hush.

[26-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised you could build a service that talks to a hush daemon on your server, and does stuff

[26-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I've had the same idea

[26-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Will chatting cost hush?

[26-Jun-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> each message (memo) costs a transaction fee, so 0.0001 HUSH by default

[26-Jun-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> larges file require multiple tx fees to store/send

[26-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's still possible to send txfee=0 things on Hush network, but that won't last forever

[26-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Miners decide which transactions to include

[26-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most hush miners are nice and will include txfee=0, but most ZEC miners will not, for instance

[26-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm a hush miner.   I don't think I have decided anything.

[26-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If chatting is popular on Hush platform, Hush miners make more money

[26-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> more transactions => more block reward

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O thanks for your kind words. I removed your troll badge, you don't deserve it

[26-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We need lots of testing on SilentDragon, it's not perfect. But I think it will get a GUI full node wallet in the hands of many people, who don't have great options right now. And it has amazing features that make it very easy to maintain. That is of supreme importance for a cryptocoin wallet

[26-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> radix42 and I successfully sent memos via SilentDragon on Mac and Windows, IT WORKS
