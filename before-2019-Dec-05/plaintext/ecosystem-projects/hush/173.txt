[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> You're being a jerk for no reason.

[01-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I never attacked you

[01-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I told you what Alex told me. That's it.

[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I was never anything with you guy

[01-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I thought the guy spent 50+ hours on this article, I should at least give him everything I've got.

[01-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> This is the internet. 
I could care less what is said to me.

[01-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> this

[01-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > The problem with crypyo journalism is that there is no reward for being critical. How would an article benefit, from being critical, about a project?

[01-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I still think your article was quality

[01-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> !airdrop 30 HUSH for 1 hour

[01-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> And you agreed with me.

[01-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> You never write articles about projects you think very critical o

[01-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i did some shit

[01-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> but not here

[01-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It's just not beneficial to be critical.

[01-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It's a tough gig

[01-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It really is

[01-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i spent more money smoking dope while writing the article than i got after writing it

[01-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> true story

[01-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Well it was a good one

[01-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> You filled in a lot for me

[01-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It was more an entire project history.

[01-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I found that aspect very enjoyable to read

[01-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Bc you didn't just go over the projects tech

[01-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Anyone can read that

[01-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> You wrote a backpiece and put a story on Hush

[01-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> You gave it a story, history.

[01-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I did what I do

[01-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Duke left. Cryptopia etc

[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Now he's back

[01-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It gives the project something for people to attach themselves to

[01-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> That's not giving ultimate and excessive praise I am being critical about

[01-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> You were impartial and laid it out.

[01-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I think you misunderstood me earlier

[01-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It's all good

[01-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I don't take anything personal

[01-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> It's simple.

[01-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Many raised the issue with Satoshi on Bitcointalk

[01-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> About how a public system of addresses, will inherently, be bad for privacy.

[01-Aug-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I believe this is where ZK-Snarks, or the idea of incorporating it into something like btc, came into the discussion.

[01-Aug-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I might be wrong.

[01-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> lets dine out

[01-Aug-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Broseph> Are the coins on Cryptopia lost forever?

[01-Aug-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes

[01-Aug-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @gigamesh Haha

[01-Aug-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @jl777c I've got a quick question.
Do all coins deriving from btc, have the ability to add metadata, or like a message?

[01-Aug-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> BTW, congrats on Antara..

[01-Aug-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I am testing ATOMIC Dex

[01-Aug-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> unless they went out if their way to disable OP_RETURN, all chains have at least 80 bytes that are easy to add

[01-Aug-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> even if they did, there are tricks to encode 100kb or so per tx

[01-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Ok. I remember FlorinCoin claiming to have this feature & that it was unique to them. I guess bs

[02-Aug-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @gigamesh I don't get it

[02-Aug-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> What did u mean by step up?

[02-Aug-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @gigamesh

[02-Aug-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cruz X (10) like James explained, yes all coins have it.  Many coins have 40 or 80 bytes, and most are under 200, but some like Florin coin allow a large op_return for lots of arbitrary public data
