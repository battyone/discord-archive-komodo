[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Now this is crazy.

[02-Dec-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I always knew there was more to the Silk Road case.

[02-Dec-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The court probably wouldn't allow the evidence to be admitted into court, and Ulbricht was guilty of starting the site, he admitted as much himself.

[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Hi guys. I made some HUSH art.

[03-Dec-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Hember Hi Hember! I'd love to see it üôÇ

[03-Dec-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Ok. Be ready. I have just started learning PhotoShop. I have these pictures in my head and trying to get them out there with PhotoShop is quite a challenge.

[03-Dec-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> This one is quite dark. I thought I might still edit this one. I like the lines. I produced this from a picture of a river, a town and a nebula + I added the HUSH logo.

[03-Dec-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> This has a lot more fire in it. Have to say I prefer darker myself.

[dscrd-hush] <Hember> I thought I might make the eyes look like eyes at first, but I like the magic more. And in fact I just found a way to tweak some tiny details. So, I guess in case you want to use this as part of something, I could take some hours still to tweak the eyes and so on. üôÇ

[03-Dec-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that you don't need to leave your wallet to find that info

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Who is down to recieve sha256 checksums, for our software, through HushList?

[03-Dec-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi i think it's best to provide the service for free, for our own software and a few other coins that might see the value

[03-Dec-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi so the first X orgs that see the value, will get the free service

[03-Dec-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then we will charge after that

[03-Dec-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I see value in it, personally

[03-Dec-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Sha256 is secure,simple, easy to decode

[03-Dec-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We do it first here to say hey, we have been doing it

[03-Dec-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The value prop is "Having a secondary source to verify SHA sums that has it's own cryptographic proof that a SHA of binary X was declared at time Y by person Z"

[03-Dec-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They need someone else doing this

[03-Dec-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can glue it all together with the memo field

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> HushList Protocol is being translated into Spanish

[03-Dec-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi maybe Pirate would be interested, other privacy coins and privacy-focused open source projects. Maybe smaller projects would be more interested

[03-Dec-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm sure they would be

[03-Dec-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi that translator should contact me, because a lot of stuff has changed

[03-Dec-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> doesn't make sense to translate wrong things

[03-Dec-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He came to Hush became HushList

[03-Dec-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FtrSaroth i am going to update the intro to hushlist, i would suggest focusing on the main paper, which will stay mostly the same

[03-Dec-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's the intro paragraph and beginning that needs to change a bunch

[03-Dec-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but whatevs, having a translation of that version would be good too

[03-Dec-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> next version will maybe change 10-20% of the paper

[03-Dec-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You can start to think about, who we can contact in Central & S America, and in Spain, particularly Catalonia, people and organizations that would use HushList.

[03-Dec-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi yes, orgs that have little funding and help vulnerable populations are probably the biggest place for us to help

[03-Dec-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think  @FtrSaroth translating it and if he wanted to, presenting it in Spanish to these orgs, would be HUGE

[03-Dec-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
