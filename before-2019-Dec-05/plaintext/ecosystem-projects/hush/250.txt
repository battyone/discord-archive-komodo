[dscrd-hush] <Cryptoxic> Hi who do I contact about ledger implementation?

[02-Oct-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptoxic what do you mean by that?

[02-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @skironDotNet 50 hush

[02-Oct-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tip.cc> :HUSH: @dukeleto sent @skironDotNet **50.00 HUSH** (≈ $2.33).

[02-Oct-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptoxic> @dukeleto I've coded out the app for ledger and sucessfully retrieved an address from the ledger device

[02-Oct-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptoxic oh, that is cool. Are you trying to contact the people who make Ledger, or us?

[02-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptoxic> You guys

[02-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptoxic> I code the app but you need to integrate it with your wallet

[02-Oct-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ah, I have seen the code in Electrum that talks to Ledger's, I think. I have never owned one of their products

[02-Oct-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptoxic> Anyway, here's the source code

[02-Oct-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Oct-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptoxic> I have already created the icon for the ledger if that's what you're asking

[02-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whattomine.com has very fast updates for it's exchange prices, I notice. Discord bots lag and cache things awhile

[02-Oct-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my guess is they are smart, and their backend updates every coin price once per minute(ish) and then the frontend shows whatever latest data the backend tells it. This allows you to be extremely efficient with API requests (rate limiting) and also show users a very recent price

[02-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good job WTM

[02-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in a former life, I was employed to make backend APIs like that. Make them, make them secure, make them scale. And of course, break them 👼

[02-Oct-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> how many times have we asked for coinmarketcap to update the api for circulating supply through their form?

[02-Oct-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they just don't care

[02-Oct-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is an automated API to check HUSH supply, they just don't care

[02-Oct-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> yeah, i sent them the api link again i doubt they'll do anything though

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> This for your bounty?

[02-Oct-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto Yes, that great. So the issue with Z-Transaction is pretty huge. A lot of attack vectors. Glad its patched.

[02-Oct-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Thanks duke, The paper really explains a lot. I also found some correct terms they used for my paper. The paper also explains indirectly why a unspent z-chain cannot be link. Hence z-chain - 1.

[02-Oct-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so those guys from Stanford were the first to discover the vulnerabilities?

[02-Oct-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ``The paper also explains indirectly why a unspent z-chain cannot be link`` -- thats funny 🙂

[02-Oct-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> which section?

[02-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto why would you reverse engineer the fix? was the documentation insufficient?

[02-Oct-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @gigamesh it was not disclose to anyone, just the source code.

[02-Oct-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ` was the documentation insufficient?` lol

[02-Oct-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Oct-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh as i described in my blog post, this release of zec is a response to security reports by those 3 people. They gave no details

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The CVE I reported is one flavor of the REJECT attack

[02-Oct-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> their paper is larger, describes more things. What I found was just one thing, but a quite important one 🙂

[02-Oct-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> haven't even had time to read the entire paper yet, but I skimmed it and it's a very good read

[02-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think I will actually print this out on dead trees

[02-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM I think it's advantageous for you to use similar terminology as this paper

[02-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then people will understand and your ideas are more easily accepted

[02-Oct-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Oct-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM some things we thought of as mitigations and improvements to ITM are baked into MW, and MW also gives some ideas for improvements of your attack/defense strategies
