[dscrd-hush] <Richy> Quite interesting to read, another reason why otc or open source exchange scripts can't be trusted without at least a dev that knows what they are doing. So many new exchanges pop up built on these half arsed sources sadly üò¶

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Pixelised Interesting, because they had confirmed that they had updated. Maybe that was a mistake on their end and they are doing so now... We'll see. Hopefully they're back online in the near future if not already.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's like that little green lock in your browser, that you know (hope) you can trust, but better. If dpowconfs > 1, you have multiple confirmations *and* notarization, and it doesn't get better than that

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's probably just miners playing games

[01-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> miners can make more by gaming the system, jumping on and off, than by being a nice person. that is called a mining attack as well. It doesn't steal money from any one person, but a miner earns more than they should on average, if they just mined all the time.

[01-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it's kind of like stealing from all the honest miners

[01-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> I haven‚Äôt looked at my hush and btch balance on the agama wallet in some time (months). If I haven‚Äôt updated my wallet, did I lose the hush and btch?   

Also, is there an ETA on exchanges where we can buy and sell?

[05-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> No you wouldn't lose Hush or BTCH.

[05-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> But you'll need to backup your private key (using old wallet), update and import when you download and run the new version of the wallet.

[05-Nov-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> Why is the hush block explorer certificate issue not being addressed?

[05-Nov-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> The Cryptopia "network issues" are likely just this.

[05-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to fix the letsencrypt cron job and be done with it.

[05-Nov-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Cryptopia have their own issues with updating to hush 2.0.0, this is just affecting the web wallet at https://wallet.myhush.org

[05-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @c0prhd our sysadmin that makes the explorer stay happy has not been responsive, and yes, I have access to the server, but would have to reverse engineer his setup/config, and that hasn't happened. It has absolutely 0% to do with Cryptopia

[05-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @peletubi any chance you can update ssl on explorer, or do you want me to go make a big mess figuring it out? üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Amazingly, I have been busy, and exactly nobody wants to do the "boring" stuff like keeping explorers happy and freshen SSL certs, oh yeah, and write code. I have very free little time currently. If anybody wants to get involved, now is a good time. We could really use another explorer, run by somebody who is not me, because unpaid sysadmin work does not interest me greatly

[05-Nov-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> When will hush be available on cryptopia ?

[05-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin ask Cryptopia

[05-Nov-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I sent them another bit more angrier(demanding) support ticket, not that it makes a lot of difference

[05-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> anger never helps, keep repeating for fix could though

[05-Nov-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Cryptopia and the Hush web wallet are two entirely different issues that do not intersect, for those reading along.

[05-Nov-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Cryptopia being down is not due to Hush, but due to them. We are working with them to resolve the issue and get them up to speed.

[05-Nov-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Unfortunately what should have already been progressed past in a couple of emails has been slowed to a crawl due to Cryptopia's horrendous level of support.... To our community members, feel free to get in their ears as well about getting it together... We are doing all we can on that front, but waiting for correspondence for weeks is no fun and makes progress extremely slow.

[05-Nov-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Without (shell or otherwise) access to the webserver, I've gone back to the start of the whole process. With the certificate information my web browser provides, the certification provider/issuer "Let's encrypt"  recommends the use of Certbot which if you install, it should automatically renew every 90 days via cron as a cron job. There may have been an issue at the time when cron ran that renew request and now you'll have to wait 90 days for the next run, unless you manually do it...

[05-Nov-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Yes, I used to be paid professional a web application developer/Linux admin (in the past). I do other work to pay the bills but for now I just delve back into it as a hobby.

[05-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @c0prhd, the ssl certificate issue definitely has no relation to what's going on with Cryptopia. They're a third party, a business that runs a cryptocurrency exchange that features Hush amoungst all the other alt-coins. They put their wallet in maintenance well before the certificate expired.

[05-Nov-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> SSL provides encryption security between your computer and the Hush explorer web server. Since you aren't logging in with usernames/passwords or sending sensitive info I wouldn't stress too much for now.

[05-Nov-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised i have fought certbot many times, it's never ever worked in a cronjob for me
