[dscrd-hush] <1112> Thanks. i  had no idea hashes could be anything other than completely different when a small input changes.

[18-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are many many many types of hashes

[18-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> each one is usually designed for some use cases

[18-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SHA256 is really bad at some things, like being fast

[18-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is on purpose, because that is a feature for some use cases

[18-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SHA256 is very bad at keeping small changes in input from making small changes in output. That would be a bug for malware analysis people

[18-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But that is a feature for other use cases

[18-Oct-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The theory of hash functions is a large math subfield

[18-Oct-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some are mostly good for implementing datastructures, but not good for cryptography

[18-Oct-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some are fast, some are slow. Some optimized for 8/16bit, others for 64bit

[18-Oct-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 here are a few: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions
List of hash functions
This is a list of hash functions, including cyclic redundancy checks, checksum functions, and cryptographic hash functions.

[18-Oct-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> I noticed on Panopticlick it lists system fonts, and the fonts i add aren't listed. 

I could never figure out why the fonts i installed didn't become listed as System Fonts. But it looks like these small differences probably don't matter anyways.

[18-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most systems don't even use a hash, they collect every bit of data about you

[18-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and use evercookies, giving your browser a unique id

[18-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> these "evercookies" can use normal cookies, and also newer HTML5 features like `localStorage` to store unique id's of you

[18-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and lots of other sneaky things

[18-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every web tracking/marketing company already does this stuff

[18-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> clearing your cookies all the time, and localStorage, is a reasonable defense, to the tracking issue

[18-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the issue of being uniquely identifiable, that means you should emulate the config of a very common browser variant

[18-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am sure there are "red team" browsers that lie about everything

[18-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> useragent, XxY resolution, everything

[18-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because each of those things is a datapoint, i have collected

[18-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> language, timezone

[18-Oct-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> everything is a datapoint that can be monetized

[18-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Allowing websites to run arbitrary code via JS on our local computers was a really bad idea

[18-Oct-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But now we are here, and need to deal with it.

[18-Oct-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> My goal is to blend in. Begin with BleachBit and CCleaner then build a profile based on time zone, updated browser, resolution, MAC address, fonts, user name, computer name. Different profiles for different things. Keep all cookies. I can't be sure any one of those things actually do anything but it's not much trouble trying.

[18-Oct-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's easy to leak the username of the current account, be weary of that metadata ðŸ™‚

[18-Oct-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> use a worthless account name like "user"

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `Fidelity rolls out cryptocurrency custody business`

[18-Oct-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a bit of good news for our industry

[18-Oct-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> custody biz => big money flows into cryptocoins

[18-Oct-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @1112  I don't recommend BleachBit or CCleaner.  Hackers have put Trojans in CCleaner, in the past.

[18-Oct-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> https://eraser.heidi.ie/

[18-Oct-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> For overwriting, I'd use Eraser, and set it on 7 overwrites, or above.

[18-Oct-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> If it were me, I'd start from the ground up. So first, I'd harden my OS & modify my Network settings. This will secure your environment.

[18-Oct-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> __
And then, I'd choose a browser. The first thing to do with it, is to modify the about:config, and limit the data leakage and the browser from calling back to the home server as much as possible.

[18-Oct-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I'd download an add-on, like NoScript to limit the websites from executing shit that would reveal your identity. And I'd find an add-on, like an LSO Cookie Manager, that is constantly deleting the super cookie in c:/users/x/appdata/roaming/browser

[18-Oct-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> __
I'd use this as my daily browser. 
If I needed a more secure browser for something, I'd run a Live OS, like Tails.

[18-Oct-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> There are different approaches. I'm just trying to create Alice, Bob, Charlie and let them be normal trackable folks. The BleachBit is to delete the Canvas or flash cookie, or whatever CCleaner doesn't get.

[18-Oct-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> What I was saying is, is that those apps have a documented history of having malware in them, and infecting millions of users

[18-Oct-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I have used them and I like what they do.

[18-Oct-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> But after they were revealed to have Trojans, I decided to put more focus on hardening the operation system.

[18-Oct-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> __
If you want to be like Bob, Steve and Amy then just run a normal browser with very few modifications to the settings.

[18-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Lol some guys don't get that installing specific privacy add-ons, within the browser, only makes u stand out

[18-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Sure, can go hardcore like that. Imagine Alice reads conspiracy stuff, Bob buys cigar, and Charlie logs into my banks. But nobody who buys cigars logs into my bank stuff. That kind of deal.

[18-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I've tried to do this actually.

[18-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> You can't use the same browser, or browser type, for each user

[18-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Its hard

[18-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Sounds fun

[18-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> There's only firefox and chrome, and IE is not working on many things. So gotta rely on resolution, time zone, other things.

[18-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Not gonna fool NSA but some tracking algo will have to work extra hard to connect.

[18-Oct-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Trident & Gecko based browsers

[18-Oct-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Which ones are you thinking of using?

[18-Oct-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Now that i look into it there's a lot of browsers. So far i only use Firefox and Chrome and IE. Using something else might be like wearing a skimask in public hahah.

[18-Oct-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> There are a lot, but they share the same base.

[18-Oct-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Trident & Gecko

[18-Oct-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Opera, Internet Explorer

[18-Oct-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Thanks. not looking to turn HUSH chat into a topic on this but it could help like-minded people.

[18-Oct-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Well I was discussing it with you, bc I think crypto privacy tech, will try to make use of what computer privacy software has attempted to make work in the past 10-15 years

[18-Oct-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this seems like a relevant discussion so far

[18-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> HushLists potential is so immense

[18-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Newsletter subscriber lists, have always been an issue. For decades, maybe centuries

[18-Oct-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> everything you are saying about confusing things that track web requests, I think about from the perspective of Hush transactions being tracked by ITM-style stuff. It's all very related, just happen to be different software stacks

[18-Oct-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> When I starting to read the ITM attack, and then what we have discussed about metadata, I feel like I'm in 2008

[18-Oct-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And I'm trying to secure my data, just on my laptop

[18-Oct-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I mean, look at email subscriber lists.

[18-Oct-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> For example, who gets the TOR newsletter

[18-Oct-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That is something very important that you wouldn't want to be leaked.

[18-Oct-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> never heard of it

[18-Oct-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> In the past or even now, when you are a group trying to maintain anon, but you need to communicate--you need a way to get in contact with each other

[18-Oct-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes

[18-Oct-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList aims to help some of those use cases

[18-Oct-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Exactly

[18-Oct-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you can use the memo field on any chain, right now, in simple ways

[18-Oct-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList is all about unlocking more advanced use cases

[18-Oct-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Such as..

[18-Oct-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all the ones described in the hushlist whitepaper

[18-Oct-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Memo field is our bread and butter

[18-Oct-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and various others ðŸ™‚

[18-Oct-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Thinking about metadata leakage, it's crazy to avoid the leakage, you just send 0.001 to 3 unused addresses

[18-Oct-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i wouldn't say it's as simple as that, but yes, things of that nature, if done correctly, can protect one's privacy

[18-Oct-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it must be automated to be done correctly

[18-Oct-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I'm trying to tie my knowledge of desktop privacy etc, to crypto.. in terms of what is possible and what is just asanine

[18-Oct-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Currently, if two people chat in Silent Dragon, does each message cost 0.0001 HUSH? And what is the lag between messages?

[18-Oct-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Like for example, using a few datasets, that are always sending out random data to minimize linkage or revealing identity

[18-Oct-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> miners decide which fees to accept

[18-Oct-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in practice, this means you can use some fee=0 each block, but might not get xtn confirmed

[18-Oct-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> even so, the memo field doesn't really care about confs or even notarization

[18-Oct-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so, really, it's how fast your node syncs it's mempool with the node that sends it

[18-Oct-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very often, within minutes or even a few seconds if they are peers

[18-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> by default, it costs 0.0001 HUSH per memo, and you can change that in SD GUI for each xtn

[18-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a few fee=0 are fine, but miner have code to ignore them

[18-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I am just telling you, it cannot be abused

[18-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Miners are not that dumb ðŸ™‚

[18-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I read the other day, it only takes identifying & linking 50 addresses to deanon, 90% of an entire blockchain.

[18-Oct-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Some blockchains

[18-Oct-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I believe this was Bitcoin.

[18-Oct-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> basically no privacy there
