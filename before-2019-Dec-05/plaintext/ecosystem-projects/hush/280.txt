[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have traveled in Spanish-speaking countries where the locals didn't speak English and I knew enough to find the bathroom and beer and haggle with taxis. I call it "broken travel spanish"

[07-Nov-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm gonna try to get some additional volume on Altilly, since it's also a CMC tracked exchange

[07-Nov-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> would be good to spread our volume and not end up relying on one exchange too much

[07-Nov-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Should also be keeping our eyes peeled for exchanges, especially now. 
Hype around HUSH should lead to some interest from exchanges looking to make money üôÇ

Enough‚Äôs enough.

Fresh 50-year low in the commodities-to-equities ratio.

The next monetary & fiscal experiment will come at a cost.

Major cyclical turn in this ratio likely ahead.
