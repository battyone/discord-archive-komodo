[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That commit is part of the work to migrate Agama to the new Hush chain

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> thanks for spreading the gospel @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool

[15-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Dark Angel HUSH has always been compatible with all Zcash ASICs

[15-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TryFingerButHole> alrighty, thanks

[15-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and HUSH3 is as well, with z9, z9 mini, z11 and all A9's

[15-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all Zcash asics are compatible with HUSH3 chain

[dscrd-hush] <SDG> @dukeleto  When is a new wallet for HUSH planned?

[15-Apr-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @SDG I am working with KMD people to get a new Agama released, and a web wallet, and our own GUI wallets

[15-Apr-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But I can only do so many things at once

[15-Apr-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Apr-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SDG> How can old HUSH be moved to a new wallet?

[15-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> old Hush chain is still going, coins will be airdropped to new chain - claim Hush3 by importing privkey into new wallet when released

[15-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Emil77> @penguin thanks.

[15-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <xerux> is there any exchange that already upgraded? My agama wallet won't change to new Adress format...

[15-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> "the airdrop is a lot of waiting, because I can only send to a few hundred addresses at a time, in batches, and must wait for that to complete to send the next batch. No parallel processing in the airdrop, so it will be a series of batches. The next batch send needs to wait a bit for the previous xtn to confirm so it can spend the change that comes out of that transaction"DUKE said, way up there somewhere üòÅ

[15-Apr-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> These questions have been answered plenty in the various channels, please take a moment to read through - it's the same as any chain hardfork to a new chain..

[15-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Apr-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <tedy> I've noticed old hush privkeys starts with K, while new starts with U, therefore I can't import it: Invalid private key encoding

[15-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @xerux On these exchanges you can't get coins

there are wif converters out there; if you use one, `60` is the new hex you need to know and the old was `7352`

[15-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> Will the Hushv2 Agama seed still work when importing the privkey on Hushv3, once the new Agama is released?

[15-Apr-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> yes, mnemonic is what it is and will always produce the same privkey

[15-Apr-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763

@Inevitability Because it's a currency and not a pyramid scheme

[15-Apr-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool That's clear. But if it is useless to anyone, exchanges do not like it - what good is it?

[15-Apr-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Many things are happening folks, Thanks For Your Patience

[15-Apr-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The airdrop is being tested thoroughly, this is not something that can be easily fixed if there is an error in the script.

[15-Apr-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I will do a test airdrop on a testchain, and make sure it does exactly what I think it should. If it does, then that same exact script gets run against mainnet

[15-Apr-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> everything will be publicly verifiable, open source, open data, all that good stuff

[15-Apr-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Anything else is uncivilized

[15-Apr-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is a good time to be mining, if you believe in HUSH. Some CPU miners made some really good money yesterday! Many pools have not yet switched, so if you are an early adopter, you get a lot more block reward right now

[15-Apr-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Many people are still mining the old legacy Hush chain, all their hashrate going the wrong place helps all the miners on the current mainnet

[15-Apr-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just some thoughts for the small-time miners, like myself

[15-Apr-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, for people JUST maybe thinking about ASICs: Everybody is getting rid of their z9m's for almost NOTHING! And yes, they are old and not competitive against brand new asics. But for ~$200 you could be mining HUSH with an asic, and you also have the option to switch to KMD, ZEN, ZEC or various other coins. It's cheaper than a mid-range GPU to get into equihash asic mining. These machines were something like $2000 when they were new

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> uh oh, CG is typing

[15-Apr-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `z9m's for almost NOTHING`
depends on perspective, imo anything over $200 landed is too much given the new ones about to push out

[15-Apr-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I wouldn't pay more than $250ish for a z9m these days, but if you can get a real Bitmain PSU, those are worth about $100 new by itself

[15-Apr-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> z9m is amazing device to learn on, super cheap

[15-Apr-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> yes with psu is definitely worth more

[15-Apr-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some people are selling batch 1 z9m with PSU for really good prices, to get rid of them. It's a good buy for a beginner miner

[15-Apr-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can also use an old desktop PSU you have laying around, if you want to save money. But Bitmain PSU will be more efficient, and use less electricity

[15-Apr-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Z11 is compatible with HUSH, but good luck getting one

[15-Apr-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I suggest used A9 or A9+ from ebay, if you have more funds

[15-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> imo, for anyone looking ahead to expand, server PSUs with breakoutboard is the next best thing if you don't have an old PSU (far more options with them than a BM PSU)

[15-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A9 is the better financial move, but will cost around $1500 last I checked. z9m is super cheap and will teach you about ASICs without breaking the bank

[15-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> and for anyone looking to get in and stay in, the A9++ is key

[15-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have super cheap power, z9m is fine, but if not, the power efficiency of better miners is very important

[15-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool do they have automated website ordering yet?

[15-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you buy on Ebay, no tariff risk

[15-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
