[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I am using mycelium and myetherwallet for btc and erc20 or eth

[07-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Its safe until one day u get hacked

[07-Jun-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Hardware wallet is the safuest/safest

[07-Jun-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I'm using ledger nano s for other crypto but would like to get KMD and its asset chains on there but there's not much documentation on it. üò¶

[07-Jun-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Don't own any KMD yet but looking at it.

[07-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> What does safu mean

[07-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @btcrealm HUSH addrs start with R... since we launched our new mainnet in April

[07-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X you are in the middle of the HW asic curve, z9 minis and z9's are less efficient than A9's

[07-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my advice to you is to mine more speculative coins. You might not break even mining ZEC+ZEN, but if you mine HUSH+ARRR+LABS and other KMD asset chains, which are not listed on normal mining calculators, you have the *potential* to win big. You do not have the *potential* to win big by mining ZEC+ZEN, you will grind out a basic living

[07-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X i hope that helps and also remember: In no way should anything I say be construed as financial advice

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Hi guys. What happens with HUSH? Mining calc says 1 M/s = just 18$ month)

[07-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> Thanks dukeleto, I have an older version of the Hush core wallet and was trying to check my addresses to make sure they were not affected by the Agama problem.  I have not done any conversions with the new chain.

[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> LoL, thanks

If it hasn't been active since then I should be fine.  I haven't updated my client since then.

[07-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is good

[07-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then you can ignore any Agama security madness, too

[07-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> Good aft. I'm about to spend my last btc on buying an A9 +++ ... Tell me what I'm doing right pls mates...

[07-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability that calculator looks a bit wack. You are putting in 1.2Mh/s, right ?

[07-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Yep

[07-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's wrong

[07-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but i am not sure why

[07-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> @Luffy i wouldn't recommend anyone get mining gear. save yourself some time and stress and buy coins outright

[07-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> would've saved me $5k

[07-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> you'll end up having to mine to barely break even and resell at a loss

[07-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @dukeleto maybe  use another calculator?

[07-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> No don't buy a miner with your BTC.  That value is low right now and you will never make that BTC ROI back.  (Not that I have experience in that....)

[07-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> Don't get me wrong, I still mine but it's a transfer of value not a profit

[07-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FYI I mine about $2-3/hush per day with a z9 mini currently

[07-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you sell at current prices, there are better things to mine. If you think Hush diff is low and we will increase value in the future, mine Hush

[07-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's very different to mine for the future VS mine for current expenses

[07-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I mine multiple coins

[07-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some are to sell in short term, others are long term investments. Know which coin you are mining, long or short term

[07-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Additionally, I mine hush because I can mine directly to a zaddr, and that makes me happy

[07-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> tell me please, what best calc for HUSH ?

[07-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and helps the Hush network security, by increasing shielded pool

[07-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @Pepin the Healer  Well, I am an old miner of gpu LTC, X11 and other shitcoins ... some failed, but others kept me very well and have given me good results ... I have my old 7950 saved as a souvenir.
That's why I want to spend my last bullets in generating future value in different currencies .... I'm a trader disaster

[07-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> When hush started, I got 10 hush each day with the old 7950

[07-Jun-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> @Luffy i have 3 cards left from a gpu rig
worth 20% of their buying price. gpu mining is dead af

[07-Jun-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> keep the btc and wait imo

[07-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> asics are even worse for resale value as value decays faster

[07-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @Pepin the Healer Undoubtedly, GPU died worthily, now to play a little with themüòÉ

[07-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i have 1070s that have never been played on

[07-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> meanwhile don't even have a desktop

[07-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> just a laptop for work

[07-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> how many coins will it take with one mega-hesh?))

[07-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is very much an estimate, but 1Mh/s on current Hush nethash should be something close to 200 HUSH/day

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> larger hashrates can solo-mine and earn even more

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <btcrealm> I still have my pair of 6950s from my original GPU rig.

Yeah, can't trade to save my life either.

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> pooled mining vs solo mining is not easy to compare

[07-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> 1070's still profitable

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> but yes, am selling them

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I wouldn't buy new GPU's, but if you already have them, you can mine some speculative stuff like various KMD asset chains that most people don't know about and which are not on calculators

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Just 374$ ))

[07-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability well, hush price has been  over 100X what it is now, in satoshi and fiat value

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> ok..  i was mining redfox

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> just switched back to hush

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> so hard to determine what the hell to mine with my new asic

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> ive switched 6 times this morning

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> current hush prices are quite depressed still and are still recovering. The time to mine the most coins is when price is depressed and difficulty is low

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The worst time to mine a coin is when price is exploding and hashrate is exploding

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> im havinga  problem sending my btch to new address

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X i suggest some ARRR + HUSH + KMD, maybe switch every few days to accumulate some of each

[07-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Mining ZEC is an option, you can get some of that sweet sweet new YEC fork

[07-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Mining is risky, and fun

[07-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I suggest mining various coins and not putting all eggs in one basket

[07-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is why z9 mini's are nice, they are tiny and cheap and you can mine a few different coins easily. But A9 is much more power efficient and profitable

[07-Jun-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> yep - Z9 mini the best !!!)))
