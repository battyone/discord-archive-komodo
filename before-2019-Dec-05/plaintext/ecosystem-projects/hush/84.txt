[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If anyone sees exchanges offering refuge to those coins impacted by Cryptopia please @ me or a core team member. Itâ€™s a common practice for exchanges to support orphaned projects by faltered exchanges.

[15-May-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hush is trading at $0.15 on TradeSatoshi right now though ðŸ˜Š

[15-May-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> I'm not sure I understand the cryptopia news correctly. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but does this mean that:
Cryptopia is bankrupt. The "Liquidator" company will sell all crypto that was held on Cryptopia and then it will pay out everyone (in BTC or USD... who knows) after deducting the stolen part, so everyone will get less, even if only the ETH was stolen.
Does this mean that we will see a huge amont of crypto being sold in the market on other exchanges soon? ... I can't believe how they can sell 2-300k HUSH ...the other exchanges doesn't have that volume. It would totally crash the price.

[15-May-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They had a massive security breach, there were a lot of coins stolen. Iâ€™m not sure what their approach will be.

[15-May-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Ah okay.... I thought only ETH

[15-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> They should open withdrawals so we can move our hush to Graviex

[15-May-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> But still... they cannot sell low liquidity coins

[15-May-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> But I still don't know how they will liquidate the assets if lots of the coins have low volume on other exchanges

[15-May-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> I assume they have creditors to pay: staff wages, rent, taxes, suppliers.
The liquidators will also need to be paid which is probably the biggest expense.
They will have some assets to sell including some of their own coins.
I'm not sure what value of customers' coins they have but surely they would only need to liquidate a percentage in order to cover all liabilities.

[15-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> @Andreas  and as you say they will be no value in many of the smaller coins so they might just as well give them back

[15-May-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> good point

[15-May-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> afterall it might not be so bad for HUSH

[15-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> I would worry more if I had ripple at cryptopia

[15-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> my other holding has 5% of total supply locked up on cryptopia. liquidating it would mean selling most of it at 1 sat

[15-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> so good luck with that, liquidators

[15-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> busy mornin', just woke up

[15-May-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> good morning

[15-May-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X I am working on our new wallet. I forked from a fork of zecwallet that radix42 works on, they gave me a push in the right direction. I would say that radix42 helped get dev momentum going buy "submitting some patches" and those patches to SevenSeas (which is already a fork of zecwallet) became SilentDragon. radix42 did choose this name, and I kind of like it. Better than HushWallet which is pretty boring

[15-May-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so yeah, we need graphics of a dragon for our wallet startup ðŸ˜ƒ

[15-May-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `I can't believe how they can sell 2-300k HUSH ...the other exchanges doesn't have that volume. It would totally crash the price.`

[15-May-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is not possible, so don't worry

[15-May-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sadly, it seems nobody read the hush v3 whitepaper, but that is ok. It was not easy to read, but there was a lot of valuable info

[15-May-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> provided they even figure out how to get hushv3

[15-May-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Does Cryptopia own any hush right now?

[15-May-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Somebody answer me that

[15-May-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> because liquidators likely won't be the same people this was discussed with

[15-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> How would cryptopia ever get Hush v3 ?

[15-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> looks like a coin burn

[15-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You have to own a coin to burn it

[15-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They don't own any Hush

[15-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptopia cannot sell or burn hush because they don't own any

[15-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> wait, what?

[15-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptopia did this to themselves

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I spent an entire section of the whitepaper on this

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nobody reads whitepapers

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i read it

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what is the question?

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> must've missed it

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptopia owns no Hush. Full stop.

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It was all stolen via 51% attacker

[15-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> before DPoW was deployed

[15-May-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, they have no influence on price, burning it, selling it. They have nothing.

[15-May-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They ignored us and lied to us up until now, when we were trying to give them all their funds back

[15-May-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They have nothing.

[15-May-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Is that clear?

[15-May-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> wow

[15-May-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptopia's past actions are making things worse for them now

[15-May-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> ðŸ˜ž

[15-May-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They could have recovered all their own HUSH, and all users HUSH, via all the hard work I did

[15-May-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but they ignored us and lied to us for over a year now

[15-May-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But, things are not as bad as you think

[15-May-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Now that we know Cryptopia is officially done, we can come up with a plan to make our users right again

[15-May-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It won't be perfect, but hopefully people agree it's better than nobody getting any Hush from cryptopia

[15-May-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Sounds good ðŸ˜€

[15-May-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Yeah... it will be kindaâ€™ hard to convince someone to buy Hush after he (and his coins) got burned

[15-May-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> @dukeleto  I had over 2000 Hush on Cryptopia as I was never able to withdraw them due to being "In Maintenance" forever. Are you saying there's a chance of acquiring some or all of those back?

[15-May-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nicklikestuna> You guys are doing a great job

[15-May-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Agreed and appreciated!

[15-May-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jabe we will do our best to give funds back to cryptopia users. Cryptopia is not going to tell us the financial details of each user, tho, so we don't have a verifiable way to know how much each person had on cryptopia. We are still thinking of what system will work best.

[15-May-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Yeah I can see that would be a difficulty, I have a screenshot of my balances but admittedly that is really no proof at all

[15-May-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, unfortunately I donâ€™t think our team could work off of screenshots alone, as they could be easily falsified ðŸ˜•

[15-May-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Weâ€™ll try to do right by our holders, we will attempt to get in touch with Cryptopia and do the right thing.

[15-May-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> If the site were working, the best one could do would probably be downloading a personal transaction history

[15-May-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> Unfortunately, I failed to do so while I could

[15-May-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Same here, I only got the screenshot for my own records

[15-May-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> You could've summed up every 'claim' submission and burned the rest/put it into a fund

[15-May-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> Whatever the outcome, at least I'm glad the attacker gets nothing ðŸ˜„

[15-May-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> @Berg Let's hope they give you the information, but I don't have too much confidence in that

[15-May-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Don't hold your breath

[15-May-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I have screenshots of balances withdraw history etc. Too, I think i had a couple thousand hush there too which i couldn't move out ðŸ˜Ÿ

@CryptoMessi14 @phoenix1986 @Donarito @Cryptopia_NZ Seriously. They get away way to easy! Ok the stolen funds are gone! But why are they holding peopleâ€™s non stolen crypto? This is stealing and the owners should be arrested!!!!
Twitter

[15-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is what we mean by "not your keys, not your coins"

[15-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is why me, and CG and various other people say this broken record, over and over and over

[15-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Liquidators only care about one thing now: profit

[15-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You, users who owned Hush, are a liability

[15-May-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You are the opposite of what the liquidator wants

[15-May-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They will sell all coins they have access to, at dirt cheap prices, to try to pay creditors, venture capitalists, people who are owed taxes like the gov, all that boring junk

[15-May-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Users who own coins that are still on Cryptopia will be left for dead

[15-May-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is not financial advice, but I did lose coins on MtGox. I have seen this all so many times

[15-May-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The above really only effects coins for which Cryptopia has access to

[15-May-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So for instance, Cryptopia probably has a lot of ZCL and BTCP, if I had to guess

[15-May-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They are going to sell it and crash the market, most likely. They don't have any HUSH. They don't even have v2 Hush!

[15-May-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptopia lawyers, if smart, will make HUSH a "capital loss", a total loss of funds, like losing your wallet.dat. Because that is what actually happened to them. It was stolen from them

[15-May-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that will reduce their taxes

[15-May-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so they will be happy for that

[15-May-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Maybe hush vsta pumped so they can claim higher loss

[15-May-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Wouldnt that be interesting

[15-May-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not likely

[15-May-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 50 coins of theirs had 51% attacks, and the ETH +erc20 attack was the biggest

[15-May-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush was maybe 1% of their problem

[15-May-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they had too many problems

[15-May-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I read the white paper which is why I asked if those that lost coins at that exchange could somehow get them back. Karma at work.

[15-May-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised cryptopia still has a lot to learn about karma

[15-May-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I lost no Hush btw. Other coins I had did go down with them though. :(

[15-May-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <alexn> I had more than near 4k-5k hush on cryptopia, so there is a chance for me to get it back?

[15-May-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I actually left 90% of details out of the whitepaper, out of respect for Cryptopia and because we were actively trying to get Hush back on track there. Now that they are giving up, it feels like it's time to open source all of it. Some of the details give us some important numbers, like how much HUSH was on cryptopia at the time of the attack and stuff like that

[15-May-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @alexn best chance for you to get it back is to stay active here, subscribe to Hush on blockfolio + twitter and you will hear about whatever actions you will need to take

[15-May-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If I said "tell use how much Hush you had on cryptopia or a screenshot", obviously dumb people are going to try to abuse that

[15-May-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So we need to come up with an imperfect-but-better-than-nothing system

[15-May-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Be cautious what details you do release. Privacy, confidentiality agreements, legal agreements, blah blah blah, etc...
