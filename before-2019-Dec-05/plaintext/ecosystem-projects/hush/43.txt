[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I fail to see how 100K coins had a huge effect on Hush. But we also have no intentions of premining before the new genesis block

[18-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But Hush is a coin with no dev fund or fees...

[18-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> How exactly do we intend to have capital to develop and grow and expand into new markets?

[18-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> With a $0 allowance?

[18-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We've been living that life.

[18-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Who in the community is funding our development?

[18-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We work out of passion...

[18-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> The admin of this channel

[18-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> What kind of question is this?

[18-Feb-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @nox lol, your childish behavior, we not noobies.

[18-Feb-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @nox Hush was a fork from zcash without the dev fees and community driven!

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It does not have dev fees

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We see no reward from mined blocks

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> This is a new team

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We don't have those funds, they were used a longggg time ago

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> 100K coins

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> at $0.03 a coin is not alot of money

[18-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You are aware we're in the process of overhauling for Sapling, correct?

[18-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> New genesis block is as fresh of a restart as I can think of....

[18-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Lol

[18-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I'm a scummy looking 23 year old Financial Analyst for a Forbes top 10 😉

[18-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Appearance doesn't negate performance, clearly...

[18-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> lmao

[18-Feb-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Is someone blocking this @nox guy? All of his messages keep getting deleted but I'm not seeing it in the audit log :carlos:

[18-Feb-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I guess he's still here...

[18-Feb-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I do not see him anymore either.

[18-Feb-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Can't see him either

[18-Feb-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Maybe it's the explicit content filter? could be blocking his messages since he said some bad words. It's under moderation in server settings.

[18-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> That's what I think too.

[18-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Ah right

[18-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Right as he dropped n-#$!@ they disappeared quick ahaha

[18-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> i dont see any messages

[18-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> i was wondering who Berg was talkin to

[18-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> lmao

[18-Feb-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yeah he probably got owned by the discord profanity filter after saying the n word 😂

[18-Feb-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice

[18-Feb-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Naughty

[18-Feb-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Neanderthal

[18-Feb-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i don't see any messages by that person, so I guess discord sent him to the memory hole

[18-Feb-19 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <nox> i deleted my own damn messages

[18-Feb-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> HE RISES

[19-Feb-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Ninkumpoop

[19-Feb-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jast> hush will have other exchanges in the future?

[19-Feb-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm sure we will

[19-Feb-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTC crossed $4,000 today

[19-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Honestly I get more excited when the price tanks at this point.

[19-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm looking for that $1,500 pickup

[20-Feb-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jast> I think it will go up a bit more, it will go down again

[20-Feb-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It's so great to see btc going up again

[20-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> Market up..cryptopia no updates...coins still blocked there..damn

[21-Feb-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> My hush coins are "safe" on cryptopia with this sapling ?

[21-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Roxin If the address below is cryptopia's hush wallet, the coins are 'safe': https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/address/t1bEBr1LdBQtHun7B5L82R65FgpWyyWFx8L

[21-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Exchanges hold their Hush coins in a transparent(t1) address so the fund are safe from the sapling upgrade.

[22-Feb-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I wrote a script that shows the total amount of sprout funds and their %, next will be to hook this up to our website so it can render the latest stats:  https://github.com/leto/Util/blob/master/bin/hush_stats

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `$ ./hush_stats
71319.70791807, 1.19`

[22-Feb-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so we have that much HUSH in sprout zaddrs, which is 1.19% of our supply

[22-Feb-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am trying to make things as "transparent" as possible, I know that this entire transition will be very confusing to many people

[22-Feb-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @Berg didn’t the team make money when Hush pumped to 26 bucks?

[22-Feb-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Hammerstein What do you mean exactly? The team did not make any money besides funds that we hold personally (if team members liquidated anything)

[22-Feb-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We do not have a development fund, there was no money for "the team" to profit on

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @Berg I meant no offense, I. Was assuming the team made money as the coin moves up by selling some of the coin

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We don't have any Hush in escrow for team purposes, besides our small donation funds for listing.

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Oh wow

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Did not know

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> No, the team is fully driven on passion work, we have no money, we earn no money

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> I figured Duke and team had some Hush in reserve for themselves

[22-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> And as the coin did well, they did well

[22-Feb-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We hold coins ourselves, but I've bought over 98% of the coins I hold

[22-Feb-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Duke gifted me some of his own personal Hush for some of my work

[22-Feb-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But we don't get development fees for blocks mined, we don't have that structure

[22-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So we have no income as a team

[22-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Ah

[22-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> I thought there was some incentive of that kind

[22-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Unless the community fronts us money we see nothing 😃

[22-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Well I guess buy now as it’s cheap, and if it ever recovers, the time invested will be worth it

[22-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Exactly why I hold a lot of Hush

[22-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Unfortunately nearly 10K of that is held on Cryptopia 😦 I bought less than two hours before they blew up

[22-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> 😮

[22-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> But hey, if the thing ever even remotely approaches it’s all time high, your efforts will be well worth it. 🤫

[22-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> 😊*

[22-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Wrong emoji lol 😂

[22-Feb-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If Cryptopia survives, those funds don't belong to me right now

[22-Feb-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Hammerstein there was also a very small premine of .5% but that was done by the original founders who are long gone. We as a team do not have those funds

[23-Feb-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Berg,  although those private keys don't belong to you, Cryptopia (as a business) owe you those "funds". You bought coins and they decided to do what they did. Hopefully they survive and you get your Hush.

[23-Feb-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Happy to see ppl buying hush

[23-Feb-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein it's not good to assume that people that are good at coding or mining are good at trading.  These are independent skills.

[23-Feb-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am the first to admit, I am a much better coder/miner than trader. I knew that I should have sold some Hush close to the top to take profits, but I hate centralized exchanges and trading so much, I didn't.  And I was deep in the HushList whitepaper at that time, not looking at funny lines on charts. BTC was supposed to go to 100K too...
