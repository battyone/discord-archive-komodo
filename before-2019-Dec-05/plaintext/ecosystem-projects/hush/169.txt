[dscrd-hush] <abdelbasset47> Guys how many hushs get with gtx1080

[30-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What's the hash rate for 1080

[30-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's probably more profitable with a z9 mini

[30-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> You probably get like 1 hush a day

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @abdelbasset47  I'd recommend you mine other coin and buy hush

[31-Jul-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jul-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @abdelbasset47  @AkiraX, when I mined it, I was getting around 2 Hush per day on my 1060.

[31-Jul-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @AkiraX 1 HUSH with a 1080? Geez

[31-Jul-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Mining really must have taken a turn... 
tough out there for a mining pimp

[31-Jul-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> here's an irony

[31-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> HUHS wallet syncs faster than BEAM's

[31-Jul-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> Which platform?

[31-Jul-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @AkiraX how much is btch?

[31-Jul-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> macOS, their community now confirming sync takes around 30mins

[31-Jul-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> (actually longer on a laptop)

[31-Jul-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> gonne b more than an hour

[31-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Speed of sync depends a lot on your internet speed and latency

[31-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Amount of data to sync is more easily comparable

[31-Jul-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto is there any kind of ETA on when we might expect a more feature rich version of SD? ty

[31-Jul-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh what exactly do you mean?

[31-Jul-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so unless im missing something SD wallet does not currently support private or public hushlist publishing, or file uploads. is this the case?
