Facebooks Libra verhilft der Idee einer globalen Kryptow√§hrung zum Durchbruch. Das befl√ºgelt den Bitcoin-Kurs, der die Marke von 10.000 Euro knackt. Nun will die CDU/CSU-Fraktion die Blockchain zur Schl√ºsseltechnologie machen ‚Äì nicht nur beim Geld.

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flavius890 are you using a pool or solo mining?

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flavius890> solo

[26-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flavius890 coinbase utxos must go to transparent addresses in Hush and all Zcash forks, this might change one day

[26-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flavius890 best for your privacy, is to not set your pubkey/address, so that every new block goes to a new transparent address. Then send those funds to a zaddr

[26-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you mine to the same address with all your blocks, that leaves more metadata

[26-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flavius890> ok, ty

[26-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Whenever Zcash supports mining directly to zaddr in coinbase, we will surely pull it in

[26-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that will probably be at least a year or more
