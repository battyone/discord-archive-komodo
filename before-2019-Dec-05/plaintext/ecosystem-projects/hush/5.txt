[dscrd-hush] <mossimo32001> WTF! BTCH in the announcement tell that POW changes and Coin supply change? What on history in crypto was that, is this like TRON moves of burning? changing coin supply to leeser will make the price normally high and can materialize this coin to real FIAT in early hoarders that can benefit now as the future of mined coins are in quesiton really due to power inefficinecy, but what will be the future stability?

[05-Sep-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> BTCH wasnt mined, it was airdropped, so there is no massive miner investment that needs to be protected. By making it a 50% PoS/50% PoW it is true that over time, the current holders will get diluted by 50%, but over a long time. So if there is a very reasonable expectation of a price doubling, it is making sense even for current stakeholders. BTCH is a unique situation and the situation of other coins shouldnt be applied to BTCH

[05-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> BTCH was airdropped, but airdrop was consequence of four forks (forks of four different coins). In 7 months since airdrop  low % of BTCH was claimed. So, no, holders will get diluted quickly and they will get diluted big time. This must be a punishment for those buying HUSH at 5+ USD.

[05-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> well, if nothing is changed, then nothing will change. so that is an option too

[05-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I actually bought additional BTCH.

[05-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I'm currently buying BTCH because of these changes coming to it...

[05-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Your point?

[05-Sep-18 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I'm buying too, but I would more prefer to have them in small circulating supply. Wouldn't you?

[05-Sep-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> If the coin does not attract the community with the help of mining, it will not have such popularity, you with your coins compensate keeping them on your wallet getting from POS mining

[05-Sep-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I don't think miners in general are buyers. Anyway, I'm done with that topic, because I'm not a troll. Make what you think is best.

[05-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I believe in a 21MM supply

[05-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But BTCH is fully distributed

[05-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It can't be effectively mined with no block rewards

[05-Sep-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> At least nobody in their right mind would mine that.

[05-Sep-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> That's why I'm personally on board with the doubling supply, but to be honest, I think we'll catch a lot of flack by being a "bitcoin clone" with a differing supply...

[05-Sep-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I've seen the same for bitcoin diamond or lightning or green or whatever one of those things chose to increase supply.

[05-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But doing nothing doesn't seem very appealing for me, with how things currently stand with BTCH.

[06-Sep-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> Btch was mined.  I mined hush

[06-Sep-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> Whats going on with hus guys?

[06-Sep-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <youngseies> Any update?

[07-Sep-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Here is something to think about relevant to BTCH supply: We airdropped about 16M BTC into the BTCH chain, but there have been many studies about how most likely, about ~4M BTC is lost forever, on broken harddrives or owned by dead people or whatever. That 4M BTCH that corresponds with it is "dead", it will never be bought/sold/mined, and that means that current BTCH supply is actually less than 21M, if you think about coins that can be bought+sold. SO, *if* BTCH supply doubles to 42M (seems likely, but written in blood yet), the accessible supply will be 42 - 4 = 38M, which is good for current BTCH hodlers, because it means that they will not be diluted by a full 2X.

[07-Sep-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> what is the reason behind increasing supply? makes any sense? if it's money for dev, better to foundraise BTC - as giving away BTCH will decrease price when dev sell it

[07-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> I see it as just scaling, cant see poin in that

[07-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> @dukeleto  I believe much more BTCH can be dead, as probably most people that could have it (thos who have BTC) never heard of BTCH

[07-Sep-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo we want to make BTCH mineable, and to do that, we must change the supply, or reduce the number of BTCH that people hold on the new chain. Increasing supply seems more reasonable

[07-Sep-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> I see, but why make a coin mineable ? sorry if stupid question 😃

[07-Sep-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> Is mining needed to support the network somehow?

[07-Sep-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> If it’s not mineable.  It’s just s token

[07-Sep-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> so ?

[07-Sep-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> I can understand that some guys in community may have bought some asics in the past and want to monetize them even more, but like to know some reasonable argument 😃

[07-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> only one resonable argument for me is miners support network, if not - makes no sense to have miners

[07-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> but maybe I dont know sth

[07-Sep-18 05:20 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I think the reasoning behind it is that no one's really using BTCH for much now. With miners will come more interest as there are real block rewards to come for years.

[07-Sep-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> having miners will indeed secure the pre-notarized blocks

[07-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> in that case make sense

[07-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo having mining in a coin creates an entire ecosystem, and if you don't have mining, you don't have that ecosystem

[07-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which means mining software and various mining pools mining your coin, which also adds a lot of liquidity

[07-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH has very little liquidity right now, it's not bought + sold much. If you want to sell, you break the orderbook

[07-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with active miners, we will always have people buying + selling BTCH

[07-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so having miners is a catalyst. Miners want to sell some coins to pay for electricity or take profits, and then traders/investors buy it from them

[07-Sep-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH would have been mineable from the start, but KMD asset chains were not able to be made mineable until a few months after BTCH was released

[07-Sep-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> hmm this arguments are not really logic to me - as you say lack of liquidity means - selling push the price down rapidly, and I so miners will push it only in that direction ... only argument I find reasonable is sustaining the network

[07-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> to kepp the price stable traders must find interest which is totally different thing

[07-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> maybe kind of vision should be first created

[07-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> or else we can just sum it up as an interesting experiment that is useless 😛

[07-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> in terms of investment

[07-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> the ecosystem idea is also a blured thing... many teams talk about ecosystem but actually it hardly exist anywhere (acosystem is when you have a marketplace or the token can be utilized for a specific usefull purpose... then groups of interest come together to exchanges some values and do business)

[07-Sep-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> to sum up - I would suggest to think about few possible scenarios/outcomes of the change and what is really a core thing. If it is a use case for token to sustain and build value then miners not sure are correct answer. For sustaining the network  security miners are fine argument.

[07-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Agree- majority of miners don't buy. They sell. Take Hush for example- plenty of supply, despite it being at pathetic levels.

Hush needs to fulfill it's ambition of having usable layers on top of hushlist to get buyers and tradeable liquidity, imo. BTCH needs to find its own way. mining is not the solution. There needs to be a purpose, too- which is kinda happening (btch as payment gateway).

[07-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> But maybe I;m wrong and having miners also will create some magic value 😃

[07-Sep-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> Being a hodler of BTCH I can also take it if we admit it was just an experiment with no realworld value it that's the truth let it be, then maybe better  leave BTCH and focus only on Hush ... idk

[07-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> however I like the BTCH ticker so would be nice if it get some success

[07-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I guess we are all entitled to our opinions 😃

[07-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> you are much more entitled for decisions as this project is like 99% your work or sth like that

[07-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I personally, think BTCH is way more interesting if we adopt VerusHash and have quantum-resistant hash function that prefers CPUs to mine it. That will get people excited, just as it did in Verus. Without mining, there isn't a lot going on. I can see your perspective tho, and cryptoconditions being enabled on the new BTCH chain is what may bring a lot of intrinsic value

[07-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with CC on BTCH, we can make BTCH a coin that other KMD asset chains utilize, that seems like a good idea and gives it a reason for being

[07-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> now sounds more like an idea for BTCH 😃

[07-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> cryptoconditions are pretty exciting, it's a whole new way to think about smart contracts, and it just makes more sense to me than all the ETH stuff. I never drank the ETH koolaid

[07-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> yes  CC wil bring some fresh air to crypto and allow some interesting aps

[07-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is the option to *only* enable CC and not make BTCH mineable, but it feels like if we gonna hardfork, lets make a few changes

[07-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we make BTCH mineable via CPUs, then we have a nice spectrum where HUSH can be mined with GPUs/ASICs and BTCH via the CPU.

[07-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can learn lessons from both sides at once 😃

[07-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> basic question is if BTCH has sth really unique that other tokens do not have or we try to enforce the value. In case of 1. it's really unique, then there should be a specific usability that any other token does not offer or offer in a worse way. If second - we have sth so we try to create value for it - then it's more about marketing and hype work to me, or maybe even useless.

[07-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> I'm not really miner so not excited by mining possibilities GPU, CPU or whatever. My laptop not strong enough.

[07-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> One more funny question - is BTCH good token to be use by people < 18 ?

[07-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> PS I'm starting my small project to make an AI for BTC trading. If it works the project could be expanded and BTCH could become for example a rev token for BOT generating revenue - but it's a distant perspective. But in that case it would have a real world intrinsic value. And CC could be used to auto send revenue generated by BOT to all BTCH holders

[07-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo> I'm only able to make small part of it anyway

[07-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @passcombo For laptop owners, there is a great prospect of earning BTCH through POS mining, for this it will be enough to keep it always on
