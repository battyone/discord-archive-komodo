[dscrd-hush] <Tupakito> Too bad they missed to mention Hush :/

[01-Oct-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yeah, most places don't seem to mention that

[01-Oct-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been a HUSH dev much longer than a KMD dev

[01-Oct-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but people don't know HUSH, it's ok I guess

[01-Oct-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It raised awareness of the entire KMD ecosystem, and that is ok with me

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c if you want to add to the bounty, feel free

[01-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If people work together, the bounty can be shared. I want to see this information come to light, if people do good work, you will get paid by me.

[01-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have many ideas of how to write the exploit but my free time is very little right now

[dscrd-hush] <denio> The problem is that such bugs don't seem to interest anyone in the mainstream. Every day we hear about how bad Facebook and others deal with our data and what they do with it. But even in my lessons I notice that even young people are hardly interested in what happens to their data. Why should it be any different in the Cryptoworld? Everybody thinks "Private Coins" are the future...but to question why? No, I'd rather take the next hype with me...slowly it's getting boring. I find nowhere is the discrepancy between actual achieved and marketing BlaBla so great as in Crypto

[01-Oct-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio that is why I am paying 10,000 HUSH

[01-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not many would do the work for free

[01-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Facebook isn't built with zcash protocol either. This is a protocol-level bug, not a company spying on us (tho many companies would love to use this kind of bug in secret!!!!)

[01-Oct-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> i know i just wanted to say that private data isn't worth anything to most people.

[01-Oct-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> they simply don't care what happens to it. Whether their IP becomes visible or not...but I like to be convinced by the opposite. I give 1000 Hush to it

[01-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio agreed, most people don't care

[01-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but all the people at NSA, FSB, CSE + friends that want Tor + Zcash + Monero to work enough so they can hide on those networks, those people are extremely interested in this stuff

[01-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Their lives depend on it and the lives of their coworkers depend on it

[01-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They don't want it to work for everybody

[01-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Or be easy

[01-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just enough so they can hide in plain sight

[01-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If people would understand this, everything would make more sense.

[01-Oct-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Ppl are paying to give they data #kyc
They dont Even know who they are giving it

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Coin exchange.io is closing

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX do the work

[01-Oct-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> make it happen

[01-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @aledel you are right, people give their most personal data away to strangers, for the chance of gambling

[01-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but i have hope for the future! We have to educate our children about the topic privacy...and i think they will get it. They are the first native Internet/Computer generation

[01-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zero-Knowledge Math, *if implemented correctly*, can give us privacy

[01-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's never been implemented correctly, yet

[01-Oct-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Then that 3th party sells ur data to highest bidder or lose it coz of poor "security"

[01-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> since i'm in crypto, i think security is a myth...but a myth that some guys can maybe bring in reality

[dscrd-hush] <maruse> Hi Duke what about this???

[01-Oct-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> http://duke.leto.net/2019/10/01/zcash-metadata-leakage-cve-2019-16930.html

[01-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> I want to say, you see the bug, but can be resolved??

[01-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @maruse what about it, we have been talking about it for days?

[01-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, people misunderstand this stuff so much

[01-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @maruse tldr: it's complex

[01-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash is lying to the world

[01-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's been fixed in a source code release, but most people need binaries

[01-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And I don't 100% trust zcash anymore, never will

[01-Oct-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We need the exploit to verify we are now secure.

[01-Oct-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> thanks to @denio for adding 1K HUSH to the bounty üëç

[01-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Ppl get these "free" servises with out knowing/ignorin that they are product of that free servise

[01-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you don't pay, you are the product.

[01-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with cryptocoins and full nodes, you "pay" by running a full node and helping the network

[01-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> And Zerocoin Protocol have the same??

[01-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that costs electricity, internet, etc..

[01-Oct-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @maruse the coins i mention in the article are affected, i didn't look into zerocoin coins. Do you have one in mind I should look at right now?

[01-Oct-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I saw the price of Zcoin was up on this CVE in Zcash news, lol.

[01-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So funny how the market reacts to some info, and not others

[01-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Literally nobody cared about Sapling Woodchipper, but everybody cares about this CVE

[01-Oct-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Ppl goes where money goes

[01-Oct-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> @dukeleto I have the tipicals: hush, Zer, Zcl, Komodo, Arrr. I though that ZeroCoin Protocol and ZeroCash Protocol were differents.   Coins: Zcoin(xzc), Pivx for example???

[01-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zcash protocol != zerocash protocol

[01-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zcash inherits from zerocash proto, and improves

[01-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so you are a bit confused

[01-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> XZC and PIVX are zerocash protocol

[01-Oct-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the others are not

[01-Oct-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmm, pivx is a dash fork

[01-Oct-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> stuff gets complex

[01-Oct-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> @dukeleto This sure üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!! Over information in net, make me crazy!! Thanks for your time and knowledge Duke üëç

[01-Oct-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: the exploit is only related to sprout+sapling zaddrs, so far that I know. Sprout zaddrs were FUCKING LUCKY to not be affected

[01-Oct-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash caught a break, but also, without proof, do you really believe them?

[01-Oct-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sprout has the same exact bad code as Sapling.

[01-Oct-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SAME EXACT

[01-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but because of the code that USES that code, it was lucky. We don't know if every zcash coin was lucky

[01-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we only know that ZEC happened to be lucky with sprout

[01-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And they left that sprout code there!!!!

[01-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I was aghast

[01-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Any sane coder would add "defensive coding" to that, and prevent that same bug from ever accidentally happening in sprout

[01-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but since they were working in secret, lying to the world

[01-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They just did what they want.

[01-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: This kind of bug may exist in many other coins

[01-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I just happened to see it getting fixed in ZEC

[01-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Does this make everybody cozy and warm?

[01-Oct-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I will look in Zerocash coins, i am intrigued now
