[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> OUR WEB WALLET IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL üéâ https://wallet.myhush.org/

[21-Apr-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> should i make an inevitable mention ;?)

[21-Apr-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Haha, it's inevitable.

[21-Apr-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> I see same people still mining HUSH ( https://hushmine.pro/) , same HUSH3. What will be with HUSH after airdrop ?

[22-Apr-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Andrei HUSH is our ticker still, HUSH3 is our komodo asset chain name. The old HUSH chain is not worth anything, that pool should not be mining it

[22-Apr-19 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I joined the pools telegram channel and told them

[22-Apr-19 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hopefully somebody sees this

[22-Apr-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but also, that pool is only 2% of the nethash of the old chain

[22-Apr-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just wow

[22-Apr-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> Noted, next:  you use for hush web wallet http not https, and i see needs upload wallet dat on web? It is gift for haker ?

[22-Apr-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> https://wallet.myhush.org/

[22-Apr-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> firstly, there is HTTPS, and you should use it

[22-Apr-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have gone on long rants against web wallets. They are so insecure for so many reasons

[22-Apr-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but so many people use it

[22-Apr-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Andrei it's recommended that you download the web wallet to your computer, if you must use it

[22-Apr-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but web wallets are inherently insecure

[22-Apr-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because of web browsers and DNS and BGP and so many reasons

[22-Apr-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Andrei it has some features to parse wallet.dat, you don't have to use it.

[22-Apr-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Using a full node on your computer is very much recommended

[22-Apr-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that web wallet talks to our explorer API under the hood

[22-Apr-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Andrei let me know if you have other questions about the web wallet

[22-Apr-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we only do open source stuff around here

[22-Apr-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Never use a web wallet of any kind on "free wifi", please people. Only access the web wallet from internet you "trust"

[22-Apr-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Be very careful of using the web wallet from some kind of internet cafe, very likely it could have a keylogger and be very simple to see that you went to a website and typed a seed phrase.

[22-Apr-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> ^ All good advice above.

[22-Apr-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <juni> I got nothing after airdrop

[22-Apr-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andrei> On today I see two hush explorers, old and  new. Old  HUSH paid  hushmine.pro, and show one balance,  new R wallet, explorer show others summ after airdrop, but totaly it is one wallet  R and t. How you will fix it ?

[22-Apr-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Andrei There's nothing to fix. hushmine.pro still hasn't updated to the new chain. that's hushmine.pro's fault

[22-Apr-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Andrei if you look at the same address on old and new explorers, they won't have the same value, because it's the amounts at block 500,000 that were sent to the new mainnet

[22-Apr-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @juni which address?

[22-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> hush3/Btc?

[22-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <juni> it in wallet web

[dscrd-hush] <maruse> @dukeleto I have my coins in Tradesatoshi. I want create a wallet in the web wallet. I can send them from tradesatoshi to the wallet without problem?? Is any advice about hush hush3??? I am newbie and really I don‚Äôt know what to do. I lost the airdrop and I think for hold is more useful web wallet that Tradesatoshi

[22-Apr-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <alex78> try first create a hush wallet on Tradesatoshi, not created ...

[22-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @maruse you didn't lose the airdrop, TradeSatoshi does not have deposit/withdraw enabled yet, and they haven't upgraded to hush3

[22-Apr-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <alex78> there is a long hush is not working

[22-Apr-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @alex78 not sure what you mean

[22-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <alex78> when you try to open the address hush on Trade satoshi writes that it is impossible.

[22-Apr-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg please ban @cuel

[22-Apr-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @alex78 TradeSatoshi has not updated to HUSH3, which is why they have not enabled deposit/withdraw. We have contacted them various times, we can do only so much. Please open a support ticket with them and ask when the new HUSH v3 chain will be ready for deposits and withdraw

[22-Apr-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the more users that contact them about HUSH, the faster they will realize they are losing money by not having deposit/withdraw working correctly

[22-Apr-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> Yes I will do this too, only if we make press they will resolve

[22-Apr-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, that helps

[22-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> as long as I don't touch either, they should be fine

[22-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Scirockoe> So that airdrop is only the hush tokens from the old chain to the new chain right? Or are we getting bonus coins? üòÅ

[22-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Scirockoe you are getting upgraded coins on a new faster, more secure chain. The old coins are not supported by exchanges, this is a "swap"

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Not necessarily to drink rare, enough those that like. There are after all such whisky as Bells, Big T, White horse and many other. Do you drink in a cocktail with Kola? Or ice?
