[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> why do people trade on non-popular exchanges

[25-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> besides the access coins they can't find anywhere else

[25-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> or is that the only reason lol

[25-Oct-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Often, promising coins appear on non-popular exchanges, such as Verus

[25-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KillahJon> thanks

[25-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> different exchanges have different sign-up requirements/etc, as well

[25-Oct-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> In any case, it will be better if HUSH does not depend on a single exchange.

[26-Oct-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <alitimate> The more exchanges, the better !

[26-Oct-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Will HUSH push for a Marketing Campaign now that HUSH 2.0 is out?
Maybe worth waiting until Cryptopia enables trading, but we can use that time to prepare the campaign.

[26-Oct-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Andreas its a community driven project so if you would like to contribute materials for a marketing campaign im sure the team will be happy to use them!

[26-Oct-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal agreed. I believe the time of relying on Cryptopia is coming to an end. They responded to us, but we still have no instructions from them, on how to restart trading. I think they are overloaded with many of their coins being attacked

[26-Oct-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is a new feature of DPoW called "dpowconfs" which I am in the process of porting from KMD to Hush, it's something that specifically for exchanges

[26-Oct-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a way of making it trivial, no code changes for an exchange, to protect against double spends. they just use a new CLI option when starting: `hushd -dpowconfs`

[26-Oct-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> dpowconfs changes the meaning of "confirmations", to make them aware of DPoW. What it means, is that confirmations will never go above 1 until a transaction is notarized

[26-Oct-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so confirmations=1 means not notarized, confirmations > 1 means notarized. Since all exchanges wait for more than 1 confirmation, their systems will only work on notarized transactions, if they turn on dpowconfs

[26-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> without that, exchanges need to do lots of extra work/code to check if something is notarized, which isn't going to happen realistically, in many cases

[26-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> makes it as simple as possible for an exchange to protect against double spends

[26-Oct-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Keep being a wizard Duke! 😃

[26-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it was jl777 that came up with DPoW confs, I am just a journeyman. I helped port dpowconfs from Komodo `fsm` branch to `master`, which helped me learn the insides

[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> @RunningMantheCoin Ah man... I hate to say this, but HUSH used to have a "marketing team" and they were telling us for the last 1 year!! that it doesn't make sense to market a product until it's released. Now it's released, but the marketing team is long gone :D
I'm not trying to bash anyone about this, but saying that it's a community project is like pointing fingers to nowhere.
Noone in the community will want to put in serious effort in Marketing as most of us only own a small amount of HUSH, so there is no  incentive to do it. And the community does not have access to make changes or post on the twitter account, website, facebook page, etc.

I think we are back to the orignal problem. That is: there is no budget for anything as the mining rewards go 100% to the miners.

[26-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Andreas the community does have access to the twitter account & website. They are updated quite frequently so im unsure when you've last updated yourself. I do agree that its tough to have a marketing presence with no budget- But @Berg is now part of the core team and is working on a variety of efforts

[26-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Yeah...I admit I haven't checked the twitter for a while.

[26-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> & HUSH 2.0 is not the product release which was talked about. Thats HUSH-NG. Hush 2.0 is Hush with Dpow implemented

[26-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Its one of the few coins that are protected from 51% attacks

[26-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Ah.... I though HUSH 2.0 and HUSH-NG are the same

[26-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> To my knowledge, Hush-NG is going to be a new interface which is very simple to use. New GUI that the ordinary consumer is able to use. Right now the swing wallet is only for the hardcore fans

[26-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> May I ask why the HUSH team is so much against introducing a 10% "tax" from the mining rewards?
That would solve all the problems this project has.

[26-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Also, since @dukeleto is part of the core Komodo team, he has tons of connections that will surely be able to help us down the road in  releasing said GUI. The lead dev on Komod is @jl777c  who i believe is the single largets holder of Hush

[26-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> The mining rewards is a question that im unable to answer unforutnatley. I do agree that a "founders reward" of some sort would be helpful. For example in Bitcoin Hush (BTCH) they are implementing staking and will stake the BTCH founders bag in order to earn rewards which could then be used to pay devs just like founders rewards would

[26-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Yes, the strong relations with the Komodo team is a very big plus for HUSH. May be the single biggest reason to invest in this project.

[26-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> I would 100% agree

[26-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Hush takes a back seat to the KMD ecosystem as that is always the first priority. But it doesnt change the fact that HUSH has the deepest bench of hardcore devs that can push this farther and faster than any other team could

[26-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> its just a matter of patience

[26-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> As far as fundementals go, Hush is a grand slam home run. But you're correct that we do have some issues- like relying on one exchange for 95%+ of our liquidity, small budgets for marketing, etc

[26-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> With Cryptopia not updating to HUSH 2.0 is has been furstrated for lots of Hodlers b/c it looks like the project is at a standstill. But there is no reason that Hush can do a 10-50x in the next alt season

[26-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Cryptopia will update their wallet sooner or later. I'm not worried about that part.

[26-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> The thing is: If they want to delist HUSH because it has low volume, they would still need to update and fix the wallet first so people can withdraw their HUSH. But if they put effort in it, then it actually doesn't hurt to keep it. Especially if dPow protects the chain. So I'm not worried about getting delisted. It's just a matter of time until trading will be enabled again.

[26-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Most definitely. The update will come- but we are working hard to get listed on another exchange so we dont have to rely on one central exchange again

[26-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> I think @Berg has applied to more than a dozen. The upcoming Sonox exchange is going to be listing Hush as well

[26-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> I know 😃 I have submitted a "few" votes during the summer 😜

[26-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> hahahah yes & thank you! 😃

[26-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I've been holding off on a full fledged marketing campaign for 2.0 since we're struggling with trade volume.

[26-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto I fully agree that the more HUSH exchanges have the better, let them be small. Wait for more than a month while Cryptopia does something has become unacceptable

[26-Oct-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> @Berg Oh wow 😃 good to know. Thanks Berg!

[26-Oct-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <paia> STEX (and maybe in future Sonox) would be great alternatives to Cryptopia. And I agree with Berg, that in current situation it's better to wait for our major exchange to be fully operational. I am too waiting to buy some more $HUSH. :thinkaboutit:

[26-Oct-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gdo369> Hush must listed on Binance ! :D 🚀 🚀 🚀

[27-Oct-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I've been trading (and buying up Hush)  on Tradesatoshi. There's plenty of alt-coin tips being passed around in the "chat box". Although they're not worth much, it gets people trading. I end up trading over to buying Hush. I've given Cryptopia the flick... for now.

[28-Oct-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> saying "briefly" doesn't make it true, I am calling "fake news" on them. I haven't heard anything new from them, but maybe @Berg has

[28-Oct-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they do seem to be aware of DPoW and that they need to upgrade now, at least

[28-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Can we say to Cryptopia we have a mobile wallet now(agama)? Would improve our coin rating.

[dscrd-hush] <Halar> Hello everyone

[28-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Halar> can anyone tell my why hush has crashed too low?

[28-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Halar> any specifix reason and why cryptopia is taking so long to upgrade

[28-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Halar> specific*

[28-Oct-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Halar, I don't speak for the developers on why price has dropped so much. But buy up Hush while it's low. Not worth mining (on GPU) at the current price. If it goes up I might. Cryptopia won't give any specific reason why they're taking so long. I've tried opening a support ticket only for them to close it off as "resolved" with a vague, canned reply.

[29-Oct-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 sure, yes, we have a mobile wallet 😃

[29-Oct-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> @heguli97 that rating is so weird though, almost everything has a yes and you still get 2,5/5 😄

[29-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Mobile wallet should make the rating go to 3 or 3.5.

[29-Oct-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Very nice, and much faster than Cryptopia which is supposed to be a better exchange

[30-Oct-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I believe Satoshi has been updated for some time now. They responded to my initial outreach within like half an hour of sending it, they just failed to let me know if they had updated or not. They responded just now because I pinged them again last night to check in and see if they really completed it.

[30-Oct-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So they've likely been updated since Hush 2.0 was released.
