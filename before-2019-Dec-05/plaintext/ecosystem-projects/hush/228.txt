[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i guess a 1 sat burn will be just as effective

[18-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if things work out, yes?

[18-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes, 1sat burn is the equivalent protection, it seems

[18-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmmmmm, this is a lot of data even for me to take in

[18-Sep-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 100,000,000 * 21,000,000 max Hush ztransactions, if we do 1sat burns in all zxtns

[18-Sep-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Quite a price to pay for privacy

[18-Sep-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it wont be possible to do that anytime soon

[18-Sep-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what is 100 million seconds

[18-Sep-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh

[18-Sep-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> 60 million years

[18-Sep-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> of CPU time

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmmm

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i would not worry about it

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe I am wrong, but I got 1157 days

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> something is not right ðŸ˜…

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> time 21 million

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> times

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh duh

[18-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 1157 days to make 100,000,000 xtns, then times total supply

[18-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our total supply will be mined in about 30 years from now

[18-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Trying to take this all in

[18-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, I guess it does not limit things much. It just makes HUSH more valuable, since it would be constantly have built-in deflation

[18-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 1sat burns might be worth it

[18-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, for PIRATE having a 0.0002 "txfee" is not a big issue

[18-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> for HUSHlist usage, 1 sats is fine, can be always done

[18-Sep-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in the case of amount=0 xtns, if you chain many together, it gets very hard to tell where the funds are actually going. I don't think HushList amount=0 memos need the 1sat burns, but I don't fully understand all of the analysis. Maybe they would benefit from it

[18-Sep-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in any case, 1sat of HUSH is a crazy small amount of funds, and so is 2sat

[18-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it could be a 0 sat burn is ok too, but not sure how that is handled

[18-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > Who knew you had to destroy zfunds to make them safe, lol

[18-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Do we know this for sure. This is a fascinating conversation but has it been proven yet. No disrespect to @ITM but aren't we jumping the gun a little?

[18-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c raw zxtns can also fight the analysis

[18-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can do a (t,z) => (z,t) xtn with raw xtns

[18-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That fucks up some analysis

[18-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> thanks for the tag jl

[18-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> i'm highly interested in reading ITM's paper

[18-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @ITM youre gonna publish a paper on this right? ETA?

[18-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh well, ITM has been doing and talking about this awhile. jl777 believes the technique is sound. That is pretty good enough for me

[18-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh don't ask people for ETA's unless you give them a paycheck

[18-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> ITM has created dependency graphs

[18-Sep-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> from a practical point, it makes sense

[18-Sep-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> for pirate, integrating a default tx fee of 0.0001 + 0.0001 (or 0.00000001)  to a burn address seems to mitigate this

[18-Sep-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @dukeleto raw ztx does not use any different method, i dont see how it would be any different

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @mrlynch yes, we are already working on adding that to the daemon

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c there is currently no way to have a taddr and zaddr input, without using raw xtns

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so analysts assume things

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> raw zxtns break some assumptions

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> would it be a hard coded zs address in the daemon? or computing a new zs address each time?

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> if it's hardcoded wouldn't knowing that address render the exercise moot?

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch new one each time for each xtn

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hardcoded would be no good, it would identify it

[18-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> we are trying to make a provably unspendable zaddr, like all 0s pubkey

[18-Sep-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if it can never be spent, then it wont be able to be spent, ever

[18-Sep-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmm, or we could make something *provably* unspendable, that is different

[18-Sep-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @dukeleto yes, but whatever those assumptions are, can be accounted for. the fundamental reverse proofing is not mitigated

[18-Sep-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need to know the zaddr with pubkey=0, not sure I have seen that

[18-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i am certain ITM can account for whatever nonstandard rawtx you make, the reverse proofing is based on a dependency graph of the zutxo

[18-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c yes, they can be accounted for. But if they are in active use, it reduces the tools of the analyst. So I believe it's in the interest of people who want privacy, for a chain to have some xtns with raw xtns that give analysts a harder time. If I make transactions like (t,z,z,z) => (z,z,z) and some of those zaddrs are getting amount=0, it really makes life hard for @ITM, I hope

[18-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if I do that every block, combinatorial complexity kicks in

[18-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the reverse-proofing is not economical

[18-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> if i understood this right, ITM has managed to track addresses through digitalprice and tradeogre by sending many notes to their deposit addresses and wait for them to be consolidated/withdrawn?

[18-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's cat-and-mouse

[18-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> in this case users must know that when they withdraw funds they have to move funds to multiple/different zs addresses, although that seems not enough

[18-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch  it's not specific to an exchange, he can just use the chain  + explorer

[18-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and with zaddrs, you don't know the address

[18-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ITM is able to link together zaddrs, i think "linkability analysis" is the technical name

[18-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> ```So far I got to know who transfered from Tradeogre to digitalprice, digitalprice to Tradeogre , but graviex people are not withdrawing as much```
i was referring to this

[18-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch oh, i didn't see that

[18-Sep-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, he sends dust attacks and then uses how it is spent to follow the trail

[18-Sep-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a lovely attack, when you think about it

[18-Sep-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> yes, we must fix

[18-Sep-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> needs a good name

[18-Sep-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i dont suppose there is a way to prevent the system sending/receiving/handling tiny dust amounts? Like a min tx size?

[18-Sep-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> increasing tx fees might have the same effect

[18-Sep-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> @gigamesh i guess exchanges can implement a check for small notes and send to a burn address, but how would you know what small amount is? it can be 0.0001 or 0.0000001 or 1 or 2

[18-Sep-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i doubt many people send less than 0.1

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ummm

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> or 1

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> amount=0

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList memos

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh preventing dust does not help

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the amount size does not help

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's just cheap to send dust

[18-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The attack could work if I send you 42 HUSH, too

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whatever you adjust the smallest size to, the attacker adjusts. Not really viable

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> @gigamesh the point in question is not people sending less than 0.1 but the analyst

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> but the cost increases right?

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are trying to prevent an attack from a blockchain analyst

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> studying the chain

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> But the more txs the harder and costly are analysis or? Is there a amount of txs where it's not economical to do that?

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio yes

[18-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the attacker will need a small farm of GPUs to crunch data, but that is cheap

[18-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think i know a few people with a small farm of GPUs ðŸ™‚

[18-Sep-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio for nation states, there is no good "not economical" point

[18-Sep-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and they are the ones that pay for blockchain analysis ðŸ™‚

[18-Sep-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but there is a point where the analysis is so expensive, that only certain addresses will see that analysis

[18-Sep-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> OK nation states... Yes that is true

[18-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> forget about gpu farms.. a nvidia gdx workstation will do the job just fine

[18-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Itm send me a few data yesterday what to need for 10 Millions tx

[18-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so ITM sends dust to z addresses?

[18-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> correct?
