[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Hello

[28-Oct-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Regnar> Yea I'm traveling right now but depending what time I get in tonight I'll get you the link

[28-Oct-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda thanks, nobody has tested on 16.04 yet!

[28-Oct-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> is there going be a SilentDragonSuperLite for android sometime in the future, cause that would be cool? a native wallet for hush on mobile

[28-Oct-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 it's possible to compile SDSL for any system that has at least 32bits and 4MB RAM. So yes it's possible, but I am not sure when it will happen

[28-Oct-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> first we will try to get a desktop SDSL out

[28-Oct-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and also we will try to make a binary for our DragonHeads, which will be ARMv8 binaries, very different

[29-Oct-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> You mean more secure?

[29-Oct-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> The best way to create more privacy for yourself, is to harden the operating system.

[29-Oct-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Some people are willing to give up more convenience than others, and are willing to change their habits. Others might want more security, but want all of their google apps etc.., and that is completely fine, as well.

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> ___
A misconception is that you can download one piece of software, or buy one device, and instantly gain privacy.

[29-Oct-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> ok, so what do i need to do

[29-Oct-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> You gain privacy, on android/iOS/windows/linux/OsX, by understanding operational security and using it properly.

[29-Oct-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> What do you want ?

[29-Oct-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> What's your goal?

[29-Oct-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i dont know what my goal is yet, but try to be as secure and private as possible

[29-Oct-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> taking many small steps

[29-Oct-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Do you need to hide something?

[29-Oct-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Or is this a personal goal?

[29-Oct-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i dont have anything to hide

[29-Oct-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> so its never been priority

[29-Oct-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Are you willing to go out of your way most of the time, when you're using your phone or your desktop, to keep your info more secure?

[29-Oct-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> You dont need to answer that.

[29-Oct-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> So you have a One Plus 5?
