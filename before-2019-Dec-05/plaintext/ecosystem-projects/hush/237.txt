[22-Sep-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> android background?

[22-Sep-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> looks dope

[22-Sep-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Why not

[22-Sep-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> It fits perfect on the phone

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am trying to make a Linux debian release of hush and :SD: , gosh why aren't things easier?

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Debian?

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "linux binary"

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Not the easiest

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> generating binaries for people pretty much always sucks

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Why not Ubuntu, mint, fedora, Lubuntu

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have a `debian` branch going

[22-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Haha

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @PrivatoshiÂ² ubuntu, mint and lubuntu are all "debian"

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> fedora is not

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> dont forget tails ðŸ˜… :troll:

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TAILS is debian

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> I'm asking @gilardh to help with the fdroid repo

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need these debs for tails too

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @PrivatoshiÂ² awesome

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Get it looking nice like Guardian Project

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Tor

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need hush.deb and silentdragon.deb for so many reasons

[22-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @PrivatoshiÂ² yes, sounds awesome!

[22-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> We can put those in our repo

[22-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a github release, not actually in git source code, but close ðŸ™‚

[22-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have Mac + windows binaries

[22-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need linux, some people are requesting it

[22-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i always compile from source, so i never use them on linux. but they are necessary

[22-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that means me fixing 29 scripts in our git repo

[22-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then generating a release

[22-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am 19 levels into that hell

[22-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> We need to make sure that SD Android is keeping ,cellular network always active

[22-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @PrivatoshiÂ² no we don't ðŸ˜‰ Why do you say that?

[22-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Lol

[22-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Czar of Android, why `cellular network always active` ?

[22-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Make sure it doesn't disconnect

[22-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what about wifi?

[22-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> We need it up and connected

[22-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> WiFi yeah

[22-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> That works

[22-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> One or other

[22-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> interwebs of some kind

[22-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not a full nor light node, tho. it doesn't need constant internet, fyi

[22-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it does a ping every 4 minutes

[22-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Have we ran Wireshark on this to see if anything goes through?

[22-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to your desktop wallet as a keep-a-live, and updates fiat prices and transactions

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nobody has run wireshark. But i did read every line of code in the app

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> If any other apps are getting anything

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @PrivatoshiÂ² it's all TLS/SSL

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> encrypted blobs

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Sweet

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> people can record ciphertext of TLS sessions, that is about it

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> 80/443 stuff

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> IP info is leaked

[22-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but that is about it. Wormholes now, that is very different

[22-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> wormholes can do bad things if they are evil, but they are an optional convenience

[22-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> They have mobile wireshark

[22-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> another layer is we need to lock down the android app, give it less permissions to do transactions

[22-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Oh yeah

[22-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> It needs limited permissions

[22-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e. we need a setting like "only allow android app to send transactions less than X amount" and all that jazz

[22-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it doesn't ask for android permissions

[22-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> That pdf app in the channel

[22-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am talking about wallet permissions

[22-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> It is permissionless

[22-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Ahh I see

[22-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our android app asks for no permissions, until the QR reader part asks you if it can take a pic

[22-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that's it

[22-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> But that would make it stand out

[22-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Txs less than certain amount

[22-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Maybe if you told it 30 HUSH , and it splits it up randomly

[22-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> 17 & 13 one time

[22-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Bc if u analyzed the txs u would see like, txs under 50, SD

[22-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> maybe if amount is over x, then ask for pin code?

[22-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio i like that feature, useful

[22-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but, I am trying to protect the SD full node wallet from a malicious Android phone with SDA on it

[22-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need some kind of PIN feature

[22-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many features like that

[22-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <PrivatoshiÂ²> Can u explain that to me?

[22-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @PrivatoshiÂ² sure

[22-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think about worst cases a lot

[22-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Such as "what if this metaverse thing can de-anon most privacy coin?" lol

[22-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What if your phone gets malware, after you install SDA?

[22-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that malware says, hey, I can talk to a full node wallet!

[22-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SD needs to protect itself as best it can

[22-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the current codebase, SD and SDA trust each other too much. There is no way to say "make this android phone a watch-only wallet" or "only allow this android to spend up to 100 HUSH per day"

[22-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> stuff like that

[22-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the only option is "give full control"
