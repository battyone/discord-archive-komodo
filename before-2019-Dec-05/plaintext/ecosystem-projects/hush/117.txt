[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Mr_Billion i know that you can create a new faucet, i don't think an existing faucet can be filled by anyone else than the owner of it who knows the address.

[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Curious why it's called Hush "Dragon" ? what's the meaning or purpose of adding Dragon to it. Why dont we just call it Hush wallet?

[11-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Also my imaging editing software license expired so having to renew it and then ill be working on that.

[11-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763

Hi, dev!

[11-Jun-19 11:28 PM] pascalist#3188
All coins with transparent address are received in a wallet!
Please tell me - How to receive the coins which are on private the address?

[12-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <pascalist> are you asking about funds in Sprout zaddrs and how to claim? Those funds were not airdropped, but if you can prove you have those funds, we have set aside funds to re-imburse Sprout people

[12-Jun-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It would be nice if you could prove it via a viewing key, but those only show funds going in, not coming out of a zaddr. So basically the only way to prove is by providing the private key(s) of addresses with Sprout funds to the Hush Team, we verify balances on old Hush chain and then send the appropriate amount on the HUSH v3 chain to a provided address.

[12-Jun-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The above should sound scary, because it is scary. You should never give your private keys to *anybody*! In this instance, the keys have no financial value and it's the only easy way to prove you had the funds, so by disclosing keys with no financial value, you get funds worth stuff. It would be cool if there was a way to "sign" a message with zaddrs, like taddrs can do (I reported this as a bug to zcash many moons ago) but evidently that is not easy to do and so the above imperfect method is what we have.

[12-Jun-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mr_Billion just about every coin has a wallet called CoinWallet and the idea of calling it HushWallet sounded too boring. radix42 actually came up with the name, and I liked it and kept it. Naming things is hard

[12-Jun-19 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mr_Billion> Naming things is hard, I agree.

[12-Jun-19 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Additionally, Pirate (ARRR) is doing the exact same process above. I sent them my private keys via a shielded memo, which is better than email or Discord/Signal/Telegram/Whatsapp. It makes sure that as few people will have access to that data as possible

[12-Jun-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I would say call the wallet Silencio

[12-Jun-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Silencio v.1

[12-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Just because dragons has nothing to do with communication or privacy

[12-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> But maybe with komodo

[12-Jun-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @dandy_sandy if you don't have the old user/pass, I am not sure

[12-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> usually it is fine

[12-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> rarely it might cause you to reindex when you startup

[12-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dandy_sandy> @dukeleto  yes thats the way i wanted to take if there is no other_ thx

[12-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you don't know the correct user/pass, your full node will not listen to your RPC commands

[12-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @dandy_sandy i have accidentally done this before too, it happens

[12-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It would not be good if you had a very busy wallet, like an exchange, and you `kill` it

[12-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But you have a wallet doing nothing, I imagine

[12-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's not receiving/sending 50 payments a minute/etc

[12-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @dandy_sandy try a `kill -15` instead of `kill -9`

[12-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that asks the process to gracefully seppuku, instead of forcibly killing it, basically

[12-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dandy_sandy> yes there will be no big trouble _ 
i have also the komodod running and do not find the hushd in the ps -ax
you think this one is the one to kill:
./komodod -ac_name=HUSH3 -ac_sapling=1.....

[12-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @dandy_sandy yes, that is it. `hushd` is a wrapper for that command

[12-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @dandy_sandy if you `cat ./src/hushd` you will see all that stuff

[12-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `hushd` is a bash script around our own custom `komodod`

[12-Jun-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
