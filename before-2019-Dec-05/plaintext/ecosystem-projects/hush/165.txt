[dscrd-hush] <D2D> I was thinking this about my directory

Basic listings will stay free as they are, and higher positions can only be voted by the communities, not bought.
I also don't want to add affiliates or adverts which track users with cookies.

So, In a few days I will be adding a new feature to the directory, and those who are listed can buy "power memberships". This gives them a full dedicated page, which I can totally customise with different elements, including charts, mining stats, price and logo (a bit like CMC, but richer in content)

The power members will also have a little thunder icon on the list, so they stand out a little bit amongst other listings.

And...because Hush have been the best community for voting and the most enthusiastic and supportive of the Privacy Alternatives website, even sharing it on Twitter and Reddit, I'd like to give Hush a 1 year of "power membership"  for free

Let me know what you think : )

[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> @gigamesh Well Ben Franklin may have said it 240 years ago, but Duke Leto said it more recently...And he might have said it without ever hearing of Ben Franklin say it.

[27-Jul-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @D2D Sounds great. Higher positions shouldn't be bought. It is also understandable power memberships are not for free ‚Äì it is an extra ÀùserviceÀù.

[27-Jul-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I admire your enthusiasm. Big üëç  for giving a chance to small cap coins.

[27-Jul-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Giving HUSH power membership for free is awesome. You can make it even 2 years for free. As you wish, you decide...

[27-Jul-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Thanks! Yes the idea is to keep it as ethical as possible

[27-Jul-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> !tip @D2D 20 hush

[27-Jul-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> üí∏ @halo kitty rules sent @D2D **20.00 HUSH** (‚âà $1.06).

[27-Jul-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> thanks!

[27-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> i'm also thinking of creating a coin for the directory with optional z addresses. But I tested the Komodo composer and I realized  it would be quite expensive to create. I'm also thinking about Verus as an option to build  a blockchain, will keep researching

[27-Jul-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Do you have an intention to launch your own exchange?

[27-Jul-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> For a hobby coin is dPoW quite expensive, but a must-have for a serious business. Becouse you are publicaly pro-KMD, I guess KMD would give you a nice discount on wallet, explorer etc. Also, at the moment Mobile atomic DEX is more a commodity than a must-have, for example. It is likely you can get most of it together for about 5000 USD/year.

[27-Jul-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Sorry I meant for the directory, not exchange

[27-Jul-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> Yes if I launched a blockchain on Komodo, it would need to have dPoW, that's one of their best features

[27-Jul-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @D2D A controversial idea for you: what about ÀùadoptingÀù one of KMD assetchains without much activity. For example, BTCH has almost everything the big ones have...

[27-Jul-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> But the idea of a section for exchange is also in my mind, but not sure if it's much more complicated for regulations and compliance

[27-Jul-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> For example this new swap exchange offer partnerships where you integrate their service:

[dscrd-hush] <D2D> https://sideshift.ai/

[27-Jul-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> and they also have z addresses  for Zcash

[27-Jul-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> maybe Komodo offer something similar, not sure yet

[27-Jul-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <D2D> --
I had never even heard of BTCH, interesting. Found this:

[27-Jul-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @D2D Give me your R-addr. I'll send you some for experimentation. I'm holding a bag, but I'm not sure z-addr are enabled at the moments.
