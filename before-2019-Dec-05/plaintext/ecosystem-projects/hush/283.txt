[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's kind of scary that commit fixes a CVE, it's so sneaky

[10-Nov-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This bug doesn't really effect most people, except maybe exchanges+pools

[10-Nov-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> even then, only people with very bad security practices are really vulnerable

[10-Nov-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so yes, this is a CVE, but it's not crazy critical. Most people don't use stuff in a way that is exploitable

[10-Nov-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is the kind of bug, where if you had a rogue employee, who was on the same network as your full node, they could hack into it when they should not be able

[10-Nov-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> same network or same machine
