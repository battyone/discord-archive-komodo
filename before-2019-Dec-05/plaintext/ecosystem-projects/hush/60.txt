[15-Apr-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Electricity is expensive here

[15-Apr-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> 16 kwh

[15-Apr-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Summer will be 20 kwh

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ewww

[15-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X for your elec rates, CPU and FPGA mining is what you want. GPU or ASIC is too much electricity costs

[15-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not financial advice, just my opinion

[15-Apr-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I bought an F1 from HAC and I am happy with it, and I mine VRSC with it: https://www.hashaltcoin.com/en/miners

[15-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> wow. that elec consumption ...

[15-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> seems like there won't be much left for gpu's soon :{\?

[15-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _will give 200 ARRR for every working 1080TI you don't want (up to 500 units)_

[dscrd-hush] <penguin> `sudo flame gpu[i]`

[15-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> `sudo literally`

[15-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `sudo cat yes >>literally`

[15-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> what do you plan to do with all those gpu's lol

[15-Apr-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> mine equihash

[15-Apr-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> 😮 at that power cons. ?

[15-Apr-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> or sudo sarcasm ?

[15-Apr-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if 1 makes a penny then 100 make a dollar 😉

[15-Apr-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> haha okokok

[15-Apr-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> bulk is the answer to profitable mining because costs are distributed on scale

[15-Apr-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> that's why all my GPU motherboards hold 13

[15-Apr-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> agreed, there's quite a few interesting options that appeared recently for such gpu's

[15-Apr-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> you can go quite a bit higher if you have biostar boards and the supporting cpu

[15-Apr-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I got a ton of B250 boards

[15-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> try out the pcie-splitter, if your cpu can support a larger amount of channels

[15-Apr-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> the 4 cores can do 32 gpu i think

[15-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> havnt had the chance to try it myself yet though - but the splitter is specific to the biostar boards from what I remember

[15-Apr-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I bought some 4ways early on and didn't have much success with them

[15-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Zmini only take about 300w thats why I picked it well  and because the price on ebay was way better than anything 🤑

[15-Apr-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> and having the power company lock in my bill for a year helps...:thinkaboutit:

[15-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> everything  is waiting on an airdrop

[15-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `Zmini only take about 300w thats why I picked it well `
yeah, wattage isn't much more than a TI and at base they are just under 14x the hashrate

[15-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Are you waiting for the coin to come alive?

[15-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Inevitability What magic did you imagine happened in the last 4 hrs?

[15-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Ah ok , depending on card on MB specific volting would need to be set - provided the MB + cpu supports it

[15-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool I understand that the coin is dead. What about you?

[15-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> why would you say that .. lol

[15-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I understand that your narrow mind has no concept of currency and all you care is if you can play "hot potato" with it

[15-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Because the coin is missing from all exchanges

[15-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> lmao

[15-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> fek CEXs

[15-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Inevitability CEX dependence is literally the anti-crypto

[15-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Have you never read the Bitcoin whitepaper?

[15-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool I don't care about you! You continue to mine this coin, buy it somewhere , But this is a big stupidity.

[15-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> peer-to-peer isn't peer-to-bank-to-peer

[15-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `But this is a big stupidity.`
Yes, yes you are

[15-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> wow😑

[15-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Tell me what happens to the coin. Will she live again ? Back up your words.

[15-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> It's already alive; if you understood crypto, you would know that
CEXs are meaningless

[15-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool I mean you said

[15-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> CEXs are the worst thing that's ever happened to crypto (even worse than csw)

[15-Apr-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> You mean I said what?

[15-Apr-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool Then why can't I exchange it anywhere?

[15-Apr-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> You can exchange it with me
peer-to-peer

[15-Apr-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Simple question. Give a simple answer

[15-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> it gets no simpler than that

[15-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> do it

[15-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> peer-to-peer, exchange with me

[15-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I am interested in exchange in the market only

[15-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I'll give you 1 KMD for every 5000 HUSH you have

[15-Apr-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> there, you now have a market

[15-Apr-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> The coin is dead , you're trying to play with toys. All clear.

[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Inevitability we just launched the worlds first pure sapling chain yesterday. The airdrop is on its way. The upgrade has already been sent to exchanges & then markets will go live. Take a chill pill

[15-Apr-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Are you deving for hush now?

[15-Apr-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Inevitability Official response from Safe.trade discord: "Hush is transitioning to Hush3, and we are waiting for the airdrop. For more info check their Discord"

[16-Apr-19 12:32 AM] fintechj#4292
where can we find a working address to mine to for hush?

[16-Apr-19 12:35 AM] fintechj#4292
are we using z1 sapling addresses or using t1 non-sapling?

[16-Apr-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <fintechj> new Hush addresses are the same format as KMD, starting with R, we also have new Sapling `zs` addresses, but I don't know of pools that support those yet

[16-Apr-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The airdrop of funds is coming, we want it to go off flawlessly, not create financial bugs on mainnet. Everyones UTXOs are SAFU

[16-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you don't have trolls in your cryptocoin community, it means you aren't doing anything interesting
