[04-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e. why do you find it useful?

[04-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> more hits than 90% of websites that use the Shopify ecommerce (and blogging) platform

[04-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> this happened before with my radix interview

[04-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i think it means 500-1500 impressions iirc

[04-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> solid

[04-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> bearing in mind The Daily Chain prob captured most hits

[04-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i could get numbers off Alex but id guess a total of 5k -10k impressions

[04-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @dukeleto I find it useful looking at it from a broad perspective. It uses sensors in the phone, to secure a room, or to secure that device. 

Would if there were sensors like that, around a mobile app, or they "traveled" with a message, to ensure it remained untouched?

[04-Aug-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto I had it open in one tab, Check now and then. They spend 50% of the time debating the same thing over and over. I still feel more people contribute out of the company then within the company. Yet all the decision making is just around couple of guys.

[05-Aug-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Zcash flip with hush.  Sure why not.  Is hush better than zec at the moment?

[05-Aug-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What's valuable is liquidity.  Lots of major exchanges with zcash

Disclosure: I plan to move ~20% of my crypto portfolio to ZCash this quarter.

After transactions are complete (first initiated earlier today), I‚Äôll still be majority BTC, but ZEC will leapfrog ETH as my second largest holding.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi YEC is just a wing of ZEC, basically

[05-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All the people who own the most ZEC, they were awarded a massive pile of YEC. Which is why it's a "friendly fork" and which is why Zcash Company is actually helping them

[05-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> YEC is a huge pile of free money for ZEC

[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> YEC is precisely the same tech as ZEC, which equihash params changed to allow FPGAs/GPUs to mine instead of asics, for now

[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We have a higher mission here tho that serves the people

[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is all it is.

[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> YEC is a logo+name change, and changed 2 numbers relating to mining. That is the extent of YEC tech

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Privacy, for me, is key.

[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yeah, privacy is important to me too. I see it eroding, even in my own life, in all directions. So that is what motivates me to work on Hush

[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> To give people a tool to get back a small bit of privacy

[05-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And no privacy coin should sacrifice or do anything, to possibly increase the chance of putting it at risk

[05-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The past 5 years, I feel like privacy has been one side taking and the other conceding.

[05-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And that's not to say projects like HUSH don't play their part, bc they damn sure well do

[05-Aug-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I just mean the bigger battles, where regular people just concede privacy, without caring ...and it affects us all

[05-Aug-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Lots of GitHub commits

[05-Aug-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What motivated you to work on btch?

[05-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I remember the Bitcoin Hush fork

[05-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> First fork to what...pull from 3 different projects

[05-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I actually bought Hush on Topia, to get BTCH

[05-Aug-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> i do like how in crypto, we get a second, third, or even fourth shot at it...

[05-Aug-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Same

[05-Aug-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH was an immense learning experience for me and made me a much better cryptocoin developer

[05-Aug-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For that reason, it will always have a special place in my heart

[05-Aug-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It was the first time I was really forced to read large parts of BTC source code, with mentoring from jl777, to understand how to do the airdrop

[05-Aug-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, it was the first airdrop, that I know of, which pulled UTXOs from 4 sources into a new blockchain

[05-Aug-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't think anybody even tried 3, probably somebody did 2 somewhere in history

[05-Aug-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH + BTC + SUPERNET + DEX = BTCH

[05-Aug-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SUPERNET + DEX are kmd asset chains, basically investment tokens that payout profits occasoinally

[05-Aug-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We have plans for BTCH, it will rise again. Mostly we need more people who want to do the work, and are willing to be paid bounties/etc. We do have a large BTCH dev fund of 150,000 BTCH, which has never been spent

[05-Aug-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can delegate, but I can't do everything

[05-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> One day I hope to be a 0.1 x jl777 engineer, but right now I am still in the 0.01 x jl777 range

[05-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto If already speaking... 10 months ago was jl777 willing to help on BTCH. He said something as Àùit is up to the community to decideÀù. If nothing else, it is weird one of you is lead dev and the other holds the keys to the dev funds. Maybe the two of you  should discuss the situation in private...

[05-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> when I first started talking to jl777, I was a exp(-x) x jl777 engineer, so I really have made quite a lot of progress since then

[05-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules there isn't anything weird about it, and this channel is probably best to talk about it. James and I talk almost every single day

[05-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules at the time, I didn't feel that I could safely protect + backup the BTCH dev funds as well as jl777 could. And I have full trust in him holding the funds. It's really as simple as that

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto  So there is a plan you will be managing these funds?

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules i work for free, so why do I want to volunteer for another free job of managing money that is supposed to be paid to me for doing work?

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's quite weird

[05-Aug-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I like to code, not do paperwork

[05-Aug-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have never needed access to the BTCH dev fund because I have never requested to be paid from it

[05-Aug-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I trust both of you. But it is not very practic way if one would like to spend a money and the other is holding the keys. If nothing else, you maybe will not allways agree in every decision. oOne of you can say paying x-amount to y-stuff is OK, other can say it is too much. I'm just saying it is better if both things (lead dev/funds) are done by the same pearson.

[05-Aug-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <maruse> @dukeleto which are the references in dev for you??? People that really are brilliant!! Thanks

[05-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> The btch fund is illiquid anyway

[05-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is some good marketing for Hush

[05-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> The reason there is no liquidity for hush right now is because people know if they sell.  They are never going to buy back under these prices again

[05-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I mean, liquidity is generally low, but there's plenty of HUSH out there for sale
