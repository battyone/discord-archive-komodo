[dscrd-chips] <sg777> after big

[04-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Understood your logic

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> I made my action

[04-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Can you see what I did?

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes DCV node can see the tx status..

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> since when you make an action your paying to DCV

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> players can't see anything from other players..

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> But how can I know what to do

[04-Jan-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> If I dont know what other players did

[04-Jan-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I'm storing that information in a matrix, I can print that info..thought i.e unnessary..so can I print previous actions of all the players for reference

[04-Jan-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> It even affect my valid betting size

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> If somebody bet I can only raise 2x bet

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> If nobody bet I can bet any size >= 1 Big blind

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> And etc

[04-Jan-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> is raise should always be 2x of bet...

[04-Jan-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and in the initial round does first raise should also be >=big_blind

[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> http://www.pokertda.com/view-poker-tda-rules/
```41: Raises A: A raise must be at least the size of the largest previous bet or raise of the current betting round. If a player raises 50% or more of the previous bet but less than the minimum raise, he must make a full raise. The raise will be exactly the minimum raise allowed.

B: In no-limit and pot limit, an all-in wager of less than a full raise does not reopen the betting to a player who has already acted and is not facing at least a full raise when the action returns to him. In limit, at least 50% of a full raise is required to re-open betting for players who have already acted. See Illustration Addendum.```

[dscrd-chips] <LocoMB> I am very hopeful about this! Poker is a mainstream application, and when it finally gets some afficionado/ business savy Poker guys on board (and a proper GUI with all the bells and whistles), it can become a real game changer! 🃏
