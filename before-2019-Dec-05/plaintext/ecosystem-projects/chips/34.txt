[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Every block chain with a Casino dAPP, has this one...  TRX, EOS, IOST

[27-Aug-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> @Privatoshi see cc-dice channel on komodo discord

[27-Aug-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> tron development is more fasterer but komodo quality is better

[27-Aug-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> they have develop the same "projects" ideas of komodo in less time .. damn

[27-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> It's about quality

[27-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> 100%

[27-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Good work being done here guys..
Very much appreciated

[28-Aug-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @Privatoshi that will be easy to do

[28-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> If we solve poker that will be trivial

[28-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Why?

[28-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> What's the big deal with poker?

[28-Aug-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @Privatoshi many moving parts

[28-Aug-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> seems very similar to chips even using LN

[28-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 ^^ maybe there is something we can take away from that?

[28-Aug-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> I'll look for some more stuff you guys might find useful

[28-Aug-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX  sure I'll look into it

[28-Aug-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> @hyperDEX If this material isn't useful, and I'm wasting time, more than I am helping--please speak up üëç

[dscrd-chips] <helios> I want to tease √† tournament with my contact pro poker game. Do you have √† date approximate for release ?

[31-Aug-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> There is no official date for release, nor do I think it will be release ready for quite some time. Definitely start floating the concept to see if they're interested and let us know!

[02-Sep-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ClaysonFrost> Could the devs please respond to emails from CoinExchange.io

[02-Sep-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> what email ?

[02-Sep-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @ClaysonFrost ^^^

[02-Sep-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> @NutellaLicka @PHBA2061 don't worry. i got in touch with coinexchange.io team

[05-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> CHIPS has a Multi-Sig donation address!
A multi-sig donation address is an address that requires multiple people to sign transactions prior to actually sending any funds. For instance, this is a 3 of 5 Multi-sig address. Meaning 3 out of the 5 authorised people must sign the transaction for it to be processed.
This specific address will replace all other CHIPS donation addresses and has @sg777 @jorian @PHBA2061 @Strob and myself as the authorised signers.
This will be the address NN's and other community donations will be put into.

`bRFaD5CPeb7jVENWf65CoVEADZUVYW2FoS` is the address. Feel free to transfer into it like any other address, both CHIPS or KMD!

If you have any questions, please ask!

I think that the [dscrd-chips] doesn't copy anymore the general channel of Chips discord but it relays messages from announcements channel. There is more activity on the other channels

[13-Sep-19 11:20 PM] phm87#7395
I was able to fix the problem that leaded me to disable Chips. I'm happy to annonce that Chips mining is enabled again on UniMining.net <https://github.com/jl777/chips3/pull/36>
The NH order that I've set up should run less than 10 hours but hopefully, due to delays between NH and pool and huge NH min diff, it reduces the diff. I don't plan to use NH on Chips on long term
