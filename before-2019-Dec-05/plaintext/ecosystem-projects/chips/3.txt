airdrop?

[15-Jun-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Alright> Maybe put this on hold until VRSC ac_eras is implemented into Komodo. First era is POW for distribution, rest is solely POS

[15-Jun-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Alright> or well you could create it using VRSC's daemon right now maybe?

[15-Jun-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I was thinking of creating CHIPS64 a 100% PoS assetchain and then when we have enough participants to distribute it

[15-Jun-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I will just need to add staking for all addresses in the wallet feature first, but i think getting enough participants will take longer

[15-Jun-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the goal of CHIPS64 is to find the best staking strategies, so it is best for people to start with the same amount

[15-Jun-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <blackjok3r> I am in. 😄

[15-Jun-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <xrobesx> I'm in for some CHIPS64 staking

[15-Jun-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> Add me to tester's list too 😃

[15-Jun-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Youplab> Hi, maybe I missed something but I didnt understand what will happen to current CHIPS if a new CHIPS64 asset chain is coming ?

[15-Jun-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <osta> Add me too !

[15-Jun-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> CHIPS64 is a test chain as I understand. a test game chain.

[15-Jun-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Youplab> So CHIPS will still be the coin right ? You can add me too for the testing , I have some dev skills , working in bank IT , if it can help

[15-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yes, it is just a game specific coin

[15-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it could be called POS64TESTCOIN

[15-Jun-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> #pos64testcoin for those who want to help out with the above

[15-Jun-18 05:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
how do I get to that jorian?

[15-Jun-18 05:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I just joined discord :/

[15-Jun-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> oh you are in komodo discord?

[15-Jun-18 05:15 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes, is that chips discord?

[15-Jun-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes

[15-Jun-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> okay here now

[15-Jun-18 05:16 PM] xRobeSx#5136
joined 1 discord and got another one 5 seconds later hah

[16-Jun-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> What kind of poker are we talking about with CHIPS?

[16-Jun-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> CHIPS itself will be able to support any sort of poker variant, PANGEA will be for texas holdem

[16-Jun-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> made pad to have list of users who wants to test this POS64TESTCOIN:
http://pad.supernet.org/N8ycKr7Fwt

[16-Jun-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> better is to be in CHIPS discord and in channel #pos64testcoin channel to stay up to date with it's development and testing.

[16-Jun-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> Is pangea also a coin? Or some kind of software?

[16-Jun-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> How is the CHIPS poker played? Inside of lightning channels?

[16-Jun-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
PANGEA is a KMD assetchain coin and it will have the poker software that runs on top of the CHIPS

[16-Jun-18 11:49 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, how can I join the POS64TESTCOIN channel on discord?

[17-Jun-18 02:20 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Thanks!  
I'm allready in #chips , didn't realize it's the same 😫

[17-Jun-18 02:21 AM] CrisF#3405
...and now I see this is the chips channel...

[17-Jun-18 02:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Time for a break.

[17-Jun-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, chips has its own discord, but the general is linked to KMD discord in here. The POS64 chain is in the chips server.

[17-Jun-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a few guys keen to play aswell. Should be interesting.

[17-Jun-18 02:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, thanks!

[20-Jun-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> How did CHIPS launch? Looks like almost all of it has been mined already. Was it an airdrop to BTC holders?

[20-Jun-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> no airdrop - simply mining

[20-Jun-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> many people joined mining quickly - that's why most are already done

[20-Jun-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> easiest way to get in was to buy on coinexchange

[20-Jun-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> and block time is 10 seconds

[20-Jun-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> yes

[20-Jun-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> coinexchange still is the easiest way to get CHIPS, price is still low

[20-Jun-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> or use barterdex

[20-Jun-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> yes if someone bought BTC on the bottom price is really low

[20-Jun-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> I'm worried it was mined so fast, maybe just one person has 15 mln CHIPS

[20-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> well can you prove that you are sure not 1 prson have example 5 mln BTC ? 😛

[20-Jun-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
highly unlikely, it has been mined for about a year. SuperNET also mined and only managed to get about 2 million during the early days

[20-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> and why it's worrying if true?

[20-Jun-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> even if that was teh case it could be either positive or negative - depoending on timing. For example if very few people got Chips then the price could go up easy. But it's not going up that easy by itself, so my guess it's quite distributed. OR at least market manipualtors does not own too many.

[20-Jun-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <HoHumBug> "maybe just one person has 15 mln CHIPS" 
http://chips.komodochainz.info/richlist

[20-Jun-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> first 25 addresses got  lucky number 77.7%

[20-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> The most any address has received is 6.5 mil and I know one of those top addresses was my pool

[20-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> Which clearly wasn’t just me and was distributed to the numerous miners

[20-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it isnt decentralized to thousands of people, but definitely seems to be in then hands of over 100

[20-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so it has the typical distribution of a lot of cryptos in the early days

[20-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I just merged in the momo code into KMD, which is the precursor to getting it into CHIPS

[20-Jun-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <xrobesx> nice work james! I just checked the komodo commit 🙂 don't quite understand it though

[20-Jun-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> what is momo ?

[20-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> Wow, top 100 addresses have all the CHIPS

[20-Jun-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> 97% of the CHIPS

[20-Jun-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> So does mining continue now or is it just dpow?

[20-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> mining is for fractional CHIPS,maybe soon CPU mining is possible again

[20-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dPoW is there for the securiyt

[20-Jun-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"maybe soon CPU mining is possible again"
I'm sure that some jackwagon that just bought a ton of ASICs will likely mine it with a ton of GPUs before then

[20-Jun-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> arent you the whale with 150 million CHIPS?

[slack] <ButtcoinSub4k> :thinking_face:

[20-Jun-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <HoHumBug> _only has like 30k left and will probably dump them to buy 6 more z9 minis_

[20-Jun-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <HoHumBug> it's a gamble, for sure, but I'm betting that I can make more back in the long run than I can holding

[20-Jun-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <cascrypto> got my mother in chips, she will hodl as a queen. and in the end loss all on games she gone love that investment, getting rich and then have fun playing

I see some more chips volume here though

[21-Jun-18 08:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
Its the same data... 86 usd sound about right at current kmd price

[discord] <jl777c> CHIPS LN network

[21-Jun-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we can create this starting very soon. I want to get some CHIPS LN nodes live and funded so we can offer using CHIPS as micropayments

[21-Jun-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it would also mean to port all the existing LN gui and tools over onto the CHIPS network

[21-Jun-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> bounties will be made available for creation of such. current codebase should mostly work with LN after the recent updates

[21-Jun-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i think we need LN GUI, LN explorer equivalent, network visualizer, etc.

[21-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> anybody wants to take the lead on this?

[21-Jun-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if we also ran low margin CHIPS/KMD and other pairs on barterDEX, that would allow conversion to and from CHIPS

[21-Jun-18 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> @jl777c I'll try to bite on LN stuff, since I might need to get my hands dirty with LN stuff this way or another in coming days.
If you already know some LN GUI and LN which might have caught your attention and you liked, please let me know.
I'll be just doing google search on all that, since I never took interest in segwit and LN stuff.

[discord] <grewalsatinder> cool! thanks @CHMEX 😃

[21-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> will also be asking for help from other communities and see if I get some refernces to good open source projects for these.
I'm sure they will also be very happy helping since most of them are maximalist on bitcoin and segwit stuff... lol 😄

[21-Jun-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> basically I want CHIPS to have all the best LN solutions all live working, funded, etc. combined with active marketmakers it can allow people to get LN experience without risking BTC coins, plus BTC txfees are still needed to do the channel creation and that can take a while. with CHIPS it happens quite quickly

[21-Jun-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> So I envision the chips website to have a very easy way to get up and running with a CHIPS LN wallet in addition to Agama, a way to get a channel established and payment sent and received
