[discord] <jorian> i got it to work by manually cloning libbacktrace repo in lightning/external/, i guess that submodule is missing somewhere

[25-Jun-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ok, so now that i have a LN node up, i guess i need to open a channel to someone?

[25-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ```
~/lightning$ cli/lightning-cli listchannels
{ "channels" :
    [  ] }
```

[25-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ```
~/lightning$ cli/lightning-cli listnodes
{ "nodes" :
    [  ] }
```
i guess i need to wait for others

[25-Jun-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> who is mining CHIPS? we need to be using the latest version in dev branch

[25-Jun-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> ok blocks are going again, had a 20 minute gap of course caused by my testing it

[25-Jun-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if you have a second node you can  create channels. also you can fund it

[25-Jun-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes, i'm syncing a second node now

[25-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> should listnodes show all nodes?

[25-Jun-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> on one node there's a lot of `call cli.(estimatesmartfee)` output

[25-Jun-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> trying to fundchannel gives an error 
```
26b49c7a33d08424ddfd9fab0f7187410ea chan #1: Opening channel: sent ERROR feerate_per_kw 2500 above maximum 1265
```

[25-Jun-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> oh i remember i think. need to set fallbackfee?

[25-Jun-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> no, still not able to fund channel. connecting is possible though, but funding returns the above error (on the node where i'm connecting to)

[25-Jun-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ```
~/lightning$ cli/lightning-cli dev-setfees 2500 2500 2500
{ "immediate" : 2500, "normal" : 2500, "slow" : 2500 }
```
to make it 2500

[25-Jun-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> but once i fundchannel, it crashes the client

[25-Jun-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> ok, it seems sg777 will  need to debug it later

[25-Jun-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I made a use case for CHIPS, totally unrelated to anything else, just because it is inexpensive and has a fast blocktime

[25-Jun-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> mpnet runs on CHIPS

[25-Jun-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> whats mpnet?

[25-Jun-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> nevermind, saw the explanation elsewhere

[discord] <Mr CASIN0 üé∞> Hey, our long term project is to start ICO for our gambling project. We're looking for people that have already walked the road and have coin listed on coinmarketcap. Do you guys offer anykind of partnerships, we can make your coin "the thing" again.

[27-Jun-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> @noashh should look into that

[27-Jun-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Jun-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> got the final few things debugged and we are almost ready for POS64 test. I added a new rpc call getbalance64 that will show the mature and immature balances for utxo in the wallet. this will allow you to see where your coins are.
I will make a way with marketmaker to generate 64 addresses (and their privkeys) so you can create an address per segid easily

there is also alright's method to generate addresses

So the first step is to use one method or the other to generate addresses and register it by posting it in a JSON tha tis parseable. That will allow the creation of a global map for the segids using -addressindex.

In order to make it more interesting I will put up a 1000 KMD price to whoever stakes the most during the one week stakefest. After that we will evaluate the next step. hopefully we get some tools during the first phase and for the second phase I will be looking for the best algo to maximize results, likely a 2000 KMD prize. Likely we will need some automation that generates coin transfers based on the algo and we can have some submissions for the algo competition

[03-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> staking contest, 1000 KMD first prize for staking the most coins on a POSTEST64 chain!

komodod is able to launch independent chains with PoS/PoW generation of blocks. the ratio can be 0% to 100% PoS. The PoS uses a unique 64-way segmented staking where each utxo's address is in one of 64 different segment ids (segid) and each segid creates a staking battle within each segment. Each block the "0 segid" rotates and becomes eligible to stake first. Every 2 seconds, the next segid becomes eligible, so after 128 seconds all utxo are eligible, but the lower segids are having the advantage.

The goal of the contest is to find the best algos for allocating your stake across the different segids. A naive allocation of 1/64th to all the segments would be better than having all funds in one address, but the game theory requires to know where the stakes of the other people influence how you allocate your funds.

In order to participate, join the CHIPS discord as we will conduct the testing there since this is like a game. To generate 64 addresses, the latest marketmaker has a gen64addrs api:

source userpass
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"gen64addrs\",\"passphrase\":\"default\"}"

of course use a better passphrase than "default", it will return an array of address/wif and also just the addresses. post your 64 address array in the CHIPS discord to register for the contest. the gen64addrs api will also print out the required importprivkey cli calls to import all the addresses into a wallet.

there is a getbalance64 call in the komodod that will print your wallet's segid balances. we will start the contest this week, likely on Thursday, so there is a few days to get setup. use the dev branch for both komodod and marketmaker

[03-Jul-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <osta> where I can found last binaries of marketmaker for OSX? please üòÉ

[03-Jul-18 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> I doubt the binaries are updated with the gen64addrs api call

[03-Jul-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we would need a new barterDEX build

[03-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dwy> Thought i've seen a date / info, but can't find it anymore :s. Is there already a planned date for this test ? Are the details somewhere available or will be relased just before the test ? (chain name etc...)

[03-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Which branch of komodod should we use for POSTEST64? How to launch? `-ac_name=POSTEST64` and what the other params?

[03-Jul-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `use the dev branch for both komodod and marketmaker`

[03-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> as for the params, not released yet

[03-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Understood. Thx for tip.

[03-Jul-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Seems "game" with allocating funds between addresses (segids) is similar to VRSC PoS algo. In VRSC every utxo is participating in staking (btw, very interesting idea, i like it). To get goal hash should be lower than PoS target. Where hash = F(hash_function(utxo_txhash, other_params) / utxo_size) ... On each block we get various utxos hashes, bcz other_params included. So, each block every utxo can be possible lucky to stake a block if it's hash <= pos_target.

[03-Jul-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Small visualisation of VRSC staking algo to better understanding.

[03-Jul-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Decker is each line there a separate UTXO you are staking?

[03-Jul-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Yep.

[03-Jul-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> So I'm guessing there is some advantage to splitting larger UTXOs?

[03-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> I'm still not able to find a goal with splitting ... seems hash function have a good random distribution.

[03-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> But at all seems you are right ... larger utxos have more chances to mine a block. Problem is in that nobody have too much VRSC to split for example in 100 utxos per 1000 VRSC each ) Because all currently mined coins are timelocked.

[03-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Genius idea.

[03-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Even if VRSC will costs nothing on market - i will still like it, for interesting ideas.

[03-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Yup, for some google cloud credits, I can't complain üòÇ
