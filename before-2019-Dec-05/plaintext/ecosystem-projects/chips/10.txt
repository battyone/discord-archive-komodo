[dscrd-chips] <Alright> his T9s are keeping the network unstuck

[30-Jul-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> 🙄

[30-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> if profit miner has more than 100TH, the difference between 21 and 35 TH as a network total is about the difference of a mouse pissing in the pacific ocean

[30-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> difference is network being stuck for minutes as opposed to hours when the profit switcher leaves

[30-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> now all you need to do is figure out how you're going to pay for the $800 per month that it costs in electric over the CHIPS earnings for me to do this

[30-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `CRC error counter=603`
fek me the amount of cards I have that are now at EOL sux

[30-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> 😭 My fav batch 1 S9 is at : `GH/S(avg) 7,038.562`

[30-Jul-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> 1/2 my shit is rekt and somehow I managed to jack the diff *up* by 50% 😹

[30-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> @SHossain the diff is now doubled, should I stop mining now?

[30-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> your coice. i'll leave my miners on just to keep the blocks going 😃

[30-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> jokes aside, with as much as is stuffed up, I'll probably go back over there and turn all off except 2 S9s

[31-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> _is setting up clean assetchains with only 10M bandwidth , so he might miss a few blocks and/or have a slew of late blocks_

[31-Jul-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> Seems 2 cores and 4G RAM is a really bad vm setting for this idea

[31-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Yeah, you will need at least 12 cores to sync them... then you can drop to 2 or 4.

[31-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> well, I made a weak vm and ran `./assetchains` 😂

[31-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> hahah.... I tried to sync 1024 chains 500 - 1000 blocks long on a 12 thread intel server with 256GB of ram.... litteraly cant be done all at once.

[31-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> ended up rsyncing all the blocks from other servers.

[31-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> @ComputerGenie i tried doing ./assetchains on a low end server the other day and it was unresponsive for almost 24 hours 😃

[31-Jul-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> lol

[31-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> well, it didn't help that it set 5 of them to gen 😛

[31-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> you can do that, if you use cpulimit to 2% or something. lol

[31-Jul-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <AkiraX> Hello

[01-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> This is what I get for being nice to @Alright 
70+ CHIPS that I can't do fekall with because I lost my consolidation script 😭

[01-Aug-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I'll consolidate them for a fee

[01-Aug-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright>

[01-Aug-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> LOL

[01-Aug-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> just send privkey here

[01-Aug-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> consolidating them to 0 isn't what I have in mind 😛

[01-Aug-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> setup your payment processor

[01-Aug-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> make it pay to a separate address every so often

[01-Aug-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I'm a solo miner, I don't have one of those

[01-Aug-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> 😛

[01-Aug-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> >give solution

[01-Aug-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> >oh I deleted that from my software

[01-Aug-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I had a script that bunches 660 UTXOs, but I can't seem to find it; I guess I'll have to remake it 😣

[01-Aug-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> because I had the consolidation script, I never had any need for "payments" from myself to myself for myself

[01-Aug-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> did you remove payment processor from knomp?

[01-Aug-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> that's pretty useful for asset chains

[01-Aug-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> you can set it up to send .05 coin payments instead of dick loads of .0001s

[01-Aug-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> no, the public release will have payments because it's expected for non-solo pools

[01-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> lol.... I just mine to a pubkey thats not imported anywhere...

[01-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> for AC that is..

[01-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> guess I need to sort out some way of recovering them too...

[03-Aug-18 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Dealer

[03-Aug-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> sg777 made the game logic which can find it out the the player who got the highest card

to run this in different terminals one needs to do  run ./bet dcv ./bet bvv ./bet player and ./bet player in four diff terminals
to run with curl , I'm adding that documentation...
to write CC contract for these what are all the necessary parameters that you would require in the winning result, let me know, I'll add those..
The winner of the game is player :0, it got the card:4
{
method: "result"
playerid: winner_player_id

[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> @Alright my ASICs are down now. they burnt the socket board of the garden shed where i was operating them from. guess, that wasn't powerful enough. need to wait until my friend gets that fixed

[03-Aug-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> O.O

[dscrd-chips] <kpprabhu> Can someone share me guide on wallets and how to move chips from coinexchange

[06-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> @kpprabhu When you "have coins" on an exchange, it's just like having money in a bank: you are at their mercy if/when you ever get what is owed to you

[06-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> you don't actually own any coins on any centralized exchange, you have a balance on a ledger sheet and a promise

@eclips the chips network is not so fast at the moment last block was found 30 mins ago

[dscrd-chips] <Alright> ....and the network is stalling again because genie rage quit 😐

[07-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @SHossain how's that wiring? 😅

[07-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> couldn't focus on that yet

[07-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> Don't mess with Genie. we had a nice plan :abusedsmily:

[08-Aug-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> We need a plan about CHIPS, can we not switch its algo away from ASIC to stop that much hash being spammed at it?

[08-Aug-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> A CPU algo seems to be a good idea, although I have no idea how much work it would be to change that.

[08-Aug-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I know this is not something james would have time to do either. I am not asking him to do it.

[08-Aug-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> maybe it can be changed to verushash

[08-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> How much work is that to do?

[08-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> not sure. havent dealt with mining algo code in the bitcoin codebase

[08-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> but it cant be that hard as that is the most common change forks make

[08-Aug-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> Verushash sounds like a good plan

[08-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Do you want me to see if I can get a Dev for this? I might know someone.

[08-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I have another suggestion. To change to dgw v3 difficulty algo. It will decrease difficulty even when no blocks are being mined, but also ramp up much much faster if somebody decides to "profit switch " it.

[08-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I will look over next few days if there are any SHA256 coins using this, and see if we can copy paste it in.

[08-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <daemonfox> Seconding Verushash

[08-Aug-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> where is the oradmap?

[08-Aug-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> It depends on how hard it is, I am def down for verushas even though i cant mine it with my main server. I do have a 2700X on the way next week.

[08-Aug-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> IMO as bounty manager, this is the most important thing to get sorted for CHIPS, if the chain is stalled it makes testing anything apart from BET pretty hard.

[08-Aug-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kpprabhu> Guys..is it safe to move chips now. Blocks are not that frequent. Can my transaction get stuck ?

[08-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> yes we should offer a bounty to change CHIPS to verushash

[08-Aug-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Dealer

[08-Aug-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Aug-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> sorry, i can't assign role here. Ask @jorian or jl777

[08-Aug-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it doesnt seem to let me

[09-Aug-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> OK so we want to change to VerusHash, I guess with that difficulty algo can stay much the same, we don't need to change yo dgw v3 which stops profit switchers stalling the chain?

[09-Aug-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> _thinks "we" is not the correct term in this case_

[09-Aug-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Do we need to vote on it? Lol I think your 30k chips is pretty in significant.
