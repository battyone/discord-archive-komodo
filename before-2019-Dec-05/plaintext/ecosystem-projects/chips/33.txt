[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> @grewalsatinder you would need to port all things jl added to KMD to CHIPS codebase. It's feasible, not "easy" but not horrific. A lot of copy+pasting code from KMD into CHIPS and then getting it to compile correctly

[14-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> might be hard to disentangle only nSPV code from KMD to put into CHIPS

[14-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Ok

[14-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> so you would end up modifying a lot of code for CHIPS

[14-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> CHIPS is a newer btc api, too

[14-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> so there is all that annoyance, various structs/etc changing names/etc

[14-Aug-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> that is my guess, James would know more

[14-Aug-19 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Okay üëç

[14-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @PHBA2061  do you have any machines with 8GB space, since my nodes are of 16GB and I never see the bus error in my nodes..

[14-Aug-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> for the gui  use the `develop` branch of pixelshove repo`https://github.com/norbertdragan/lightning-chips-frontend/tree/develop` and for the backend use the `poker_test` branch of `bet` repo....the backend nodes should start as follows:

[14-Aug-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> `./bet dcv <dcv_ip>` for dcv `./bet bvv <dcv_ip>` for bvv  `./bet player <dcv_ip>` for player

[14-Aug-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> rather than entering the ip's manually in the gui for testing you can create `.env` files in `lightning-poker-front` root directory...and copy paster the addresses as below in the `.env` file created

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @dukeleto  sometimes im getting `bus error` on the 4GB machine, when i do backtrace it's always either in `malloc` and `calloc`, i posted the logs below...

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> if you have any suggestions on this please share...

[14-Aug-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> probably it failed because it can't find contiguous blocks of memory to allocate ? the total memory usage is only about 1.7 Gb, so I thought 4Gb would be sufficient.
I'll be testing on my own 4 Google VM first, they can be scaled if needed, then on Vultr's nodes later

[14-Aug-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, is there a way we clean up and swap the remaining memory looks contiguous..

[14-Aug-19 07:32 AM] phm87#7395
Maybe define a big swap file

[14-Aug-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> how to do that, any reference links please..

[14-Aug-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @PHBA2061 when I run the `free -h` it's showing very less free memory..

Bus error
In computing, a bus error is a fault raised by hardware, notifying an operating system (OS) that a process is trying to access memory that the CPU cannot physically address: an invalid address for the address bus, hence the name. In modern use on most architectures these are ...

[14-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> Get more memory, nothing else gonna fix that. Maybe close down all unnecessary programs

[14-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> Or change the code to use less memory

[14-Aug-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> thanks @dukeleto for the inputs..

[14-Aug-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @PHBA2061 I guess we need to setup atleast 8 GB machines....meanwhile I'll try make changes to code to use less memory..

[14-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> compiling almost takes much more memory than users need to run it, FYI

[14-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> average users won't need 8GB of ram, but devs need that to compile

[15-Aug-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> @sg777 I just tested it on my own 4 nodes, increased the RAM to 8Gb, still got random crash on 1 of 4 nodes (below is a backtrace on 1 player node):

free -h shows about 5Gb free on each node, I'll try to increase the amount of RAM to 16 Gb tomorrow.

[15-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> @sg777 increasing RAM to 16Gb doesn't seems to mitigate the problem on my side, still run into random crashes with `malloc_consolidate `

[15-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I'll debug, thanks for testing.

[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> When competition?

[18-Aug-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> If you mean when will CHIPS host a competition. We will do this when we have launched the official application. There will be alpha and beta testing in the medium term though

[18-Aug-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> I'm excited :)

[18-Aug-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> How are you guys going to set yourself apart from other crypto casinos? Like edgeless. I guess they are not fully decentralized... But they have low fees which people like. It would be cool if you guys reduced fees and added a tip the dealer option. Poker pros normally tip the dealer, I wonder if they would tip the ecosystem üòÇ

[18-Aug-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> The current plan for rake is 1% which is significantly lower than every online poker facilitator. 0.5% to development, 0.25% to dealers and 0.25% to BVVs. This is subject to adjustment once we have considered all of the factors at play.
I dont mind the tip the dealer option though. That sounds like a reasonable thing to add. 
The biggest draw card for CHIPS is the decentralised, trust less nature of the dapp.

[18-Aug-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <allbits> Can dealer portion of rake be a parameter set by dealer?

[18-Aug-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I'd suggest not. I think it doesnt require a variable parameter. The idea is to give people an incentive to setup a dealer node, not to create a set of tables with different rake amounts.

[18-Aug-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Im sure the dealer nodes will get great tips. I know poker players, sometimes they only win 100 and tip $5, pretty nice! I wouldn't üòÇ

[18-Aug-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> If you look at the pic below, the average rake of different facilitators is around 4-5%. 
I'd suggest that even having a 2% rake would be a massive improvement for players and provide some decent dev funds

[18-Aug-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> I thought edgeless or a different crypro project had 0% rake? Or was that 0% house edge?

[18-Aug-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Maybe less rake for using chips

[18-Aug-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> But im overcomplicating things üòÇ

[18-Aug-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Im just excited, crypto conditions will be great for chips and I think people will be really interested in playing :)

[18-Aug-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> It would also be cool to see chatting enabled or maybe select an emoticon face while betting. Part of the fun of poker is trying to read the others.

[18-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> @NutellaLicka what is the average rake size vs popularity? Does a lower rake actually equal more popular?

[18-Aug-19 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> That is a hard one to measure. Rake size is actually hard to work out, and a lot of them have rake back incentives if you play a lot with them. The article I pulled that from did the math over 1000 hands I believe.
I know poker players care a lot about rake. Especially professional ones. Be cause they have to put more hours in, to get the take that they have paid back. The more rake per pot they pay, the less money per hour they're getting

[19-Aug-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Also there are many other factors driving people to poker sites. Things I've noted are: Rake, deposit/withdrawal features and facilities, the actual players on the site and how they play(whether they're majority professionals or amateurs), whether the site offers different tournaments, whether it's mainly cash games, how many hands one can play at a time and how smoothly the application runs when opening multiple tables.

[19-Aug-19 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Tournaments would be cool. $10 buy in.

[19-Aug-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I'm sure there would be plenty of variations of buy ins and prize pools

[19-Aug-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> ```jl777c07/02/2018
with pangea poker there will be a dealer settable rake and a percentage will also go to pangea. 20% of the pangea goes to BET```
Looks like the intent is to have a dealer settable rake as you've spoken about

[19-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> bots are a real issue, pro players will not come back once some bots show up. private tables, or invite-only tables are a must imo

[19-Aug-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> I like that idea, private tables sound good. Or maybe set tables for certain win rate and account age. Idk how to actually protect, seems like this is an issue all people are facing. I guess it is hard to differentiate between bot and human. Other than with chat. A chat to gameplay rate maybe üòÇ but then they would spam chat.. idk

[19-Aug-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Maybe a minigame during breaks that only humans can solve.

[19-Aug-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Captcha alternative that works.

[19-Aug-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Or maybe the game settings could be made in such a way that using a bot is not worth it. Random cards.

[dscrd-chips] <LocoMB> umm .. are CHIPS devs aware of this naming collision?

[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> they started years after CHIPS, what to do?

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @dukeleto do you know of anyone who would be capable and interested in this task?
@grewalsatinder just for your awareness, we need to find somebody else to complete the verushashv2 port

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @blackjok3r - lizard tamer 
If VerusHash V2 is brought into CHIPS code, would this be an easier transition to bring it into KMD code to be used on SmartChains?

[23-Aug-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> @NutellaLicka I know that already.

[23-Aug-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> probably don't need verushash v2 anymore.

[23-Aug-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> @jl777c might have some solution.

[23-Aug-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> adaptivepow will fix this exact issue and would only require changing the getnextwork function

[23-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> @NutellaLicka no, I don't and it sounds like chips might not need/want verushash, which is maybe the best course of action
