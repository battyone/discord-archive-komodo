[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I have much the same amount though.

[dscrd-chips] <Alright> computergeniecomputergenie
is there any-feken-thing that you're not a contrarian about?

[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> ` Lol I think your 30k chips is pretty in significant [sic].`
not sure what my current trade holdings has to do with willingness of no one else to mine the damn coin, but sure....

[09-Aug-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> There's no shame in admitting that you've gotten all the use out of mining that you're inclined to be involved in. üòâ

[09-Aug-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I meant for Vote weight

[09-Aug-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> The chain clearly no longer needs to be mined for profits, it needs to be mined so that we can use it!

[09-Aug-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I have a shit tonne of chips, as it is they are worth  almost nothing. If the chain dies they are worth 0.

[09-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> poor decision not to sell more when they were worth $15,000 lol

[09-Aug-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> So, because you didn't dump yours I should switch to a new mining format?

[09-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I dont know what you mean.... The chain needs to work... With it so easily attacked with ASIC's because hte blockreward is so low, we need to do something about it... Mining is not all about getting free money.

[09-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> It creates blocks, so the chain can be used üòï

[09-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `Mining is not all about getting free money.`
Then get to mining üôÇ

[09-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> And who is this person that you imagine is going to "attack" the chain for 97 cents worth of coinage?

[09-Aug-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> or $1.95 if dPoW is set at 200

[09-Aug-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @ComputerGenie you don't think people "attack" chains just for the lulz?

[09-Aug-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright>

[09-Aug-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> it doesn't open the chain up to any attack vectors

[09-Aug-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> although, someone could selfish mine while the chain is stalled because notarizations are not happening

[09-Aug-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `you don't think people "attack" chains just for the lulz?`
I'm entirely certain that some people do

[09-Aug-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I agree

[09-Aug-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> going to suck for you when I broadcast my longer chain

[09-Aug-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> yes, going to completely suck for me to not get any of the coins I'm not currently mining üôÑ

[09-Aug-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> not actually selfish mining üòõ

[13-Aug-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> @blackjok3r I saw your post in POS64 but switched to here so we can keep that about the Staked chain...

Do we have confirmation that people are actually going to mine CHIPS if the algo is switched to Verushash?

I know your server can't, and some of mine can't, and I'm not sure how many people are interested in the low BR. 

I know we have to do something to keep the chain moving, I"m just curious if there are confirmed people who will mine with it

[13-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Shossain and james both wanted it done

[13-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> notaries can mine the chain, for ever and it will never break no matter price or block reward

[13-Aug-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Genie got really really angry about it

[13-Aug-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> roger that, as long as someone will mine it.

[13-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> I think what he got angry about was that he planned on fees down the line when CHIPS is up and running, now it's switching to something that will create added equipment expense for him to do so.

[13-Aug-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> Miners don't seem to like buying equipment for just 1-2 coins. ü§∑üèø

[13-Aug-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I think his point was more, "there's nothing wrong with SHA256, just no one wants to mine it.." because its unprofitable. Which is why I was just checking above that people will actually mine VerusHash

[13-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> Small block rewards aren't very intriguing for people no matter what the algo

[13-Aug-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> Going by what all I read, he didn't seem to have much ability to mine VerusHash with what he has

[13-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> the point with VerusHash is that its CPU so notaries can mine it... no amtter wheather its profitable or not, because its basically free

[13-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I cant even mine it on my notary... üò¶ so am doing all the work for others to gain the CHIPS in minign rewards.

[13-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> not that I have go too far... all I get is million of compile errors atm

[13-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> yea I was going to say you can't mine it ha. And personally I'm not going to put a bunch of NN cores on mining. I'd prefer to mine on a specific machine

[13-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> That seemed to be his other point, that you're taking something open to all and limiting the amount of people that *can* mine it

[13-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> but good work joker, it will be cool to see

[13-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I do see genie's point.  And when the day comes that CHIPS/bet is being used a lot, BTC miners could have been interested in the fees.

[13-Aug-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> the point is, that if the chain is getting profit switched it stalls..

[13-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I understand that and still agree with him in a way

[13-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> we don't value it enough to mine it now..

[13-Aug-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> Hey guys, I'm just trying to add a few suggestions.

Is adding merge mining an option. I know various older coins have played with that type of thing. Though I believe that even on those, hash rate has historicaly declined with out new coin reward. Too bad Komodo miners couldn't merge mine chips.

The profit switcher seems more of an attack. If the attack is really only feasible till chips takes off, what would be the cost to add hash till chips is seeing more demand? 
Maybe POS Chips? What do other coins do to protect against this issue?

[13-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> profit switching isn't an "attack", it's just a fact of profitable mining multiple coins for miners

[13-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Profit switching is only a problem for low hash rate coins. Chips has dPoW so doesnt need a massive hash rate. And its dicciculty algo isnt great either. Must be straight BTC clone, but adjusted faster I think. I have been advised not to try anduse dgw v3 diff adjustment now either, it has attack vectors too.

[15-Aug-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> the project is alive?

[15-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> yes this project is alive

[17-Aug-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miningpools (miningpools.cloud)> chips will be changed to verushash? if yes 21 mln of chips mined how will be calculated?

[17-Aug-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> It might be... Havent been able to get it to work so far

[17-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> coin emmsiion will remain the same, may change difficulty calc and port to VerusHash so it can be CPU mined... may aldo change to 20s blocks instead of 10s.

[21-Aug-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <superslack> where can I find an explorer for chips

[dscrd-chips] <thedawson13> Thanks. Store in agama?

[24-Aug-18 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> agama works nicely, yes

[26-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> what's going on guys

[26-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> any betting games yet?

[27-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 is debugging the LN payment and then the first (simplest) game will be ready. once we get the simplest game working, making more complex games is a matter to update the game logic. that is an independent process without any particularly difficulty, we are solving the decentralization problems first

[27-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we have a plan of incremental improvements/enhancements that will evolve the current codebase to the full solution, but since we are not marketing yet, you will need to track progress via github

[27-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> thanks for the update

[27-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> making a decentralized gamble out of this would be really nice

[27-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> yes, it will be very random

[27-Aug-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> and LN will be able to be used for realtime betting

[27-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> when its ready I want to try adopting a game to the Chinese crypto community

[27-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> Chinese are the biggest gambler in the world

Did the chips airdrop get distributed? I dont see any in my agama wallet.

[28-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> Chips has never been an airdrop. It‚Äôs been all PoW mining since the start

[28-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 lets discuss the dev details here from now on. as we get closer to usable tech, it is time to be more open about things

[28-Aug-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, I taken off last couple of days...I'll post the update on `pay` command here...

[28-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> chips chain is stalled.. was there a solution for this already?

[28-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> just read a bit above. staking a la VRSC?

[28-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and did computergenie leave again? üòÖ

[28-Aug-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> anyways, i can't help test LN when chips chain is stalled

[28-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Yes, I tried to port VerusHash to chips, not stake just the hash function, so that it was a lot harder to hash attach it and stall the chain.

[28-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> But I couldnt get it to work.

[28-Aug-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> nice that you tried

[28-Aug-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> this badly needs a fix

[28-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> https://explorer.chips.cash/ is down

[28-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> has been for a while

[28-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> chain still stalled? I can rent some hash

[28-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @grewalsatinder needs to redirect it to another explorer

[28-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> kind of hurts to keep doing that though

[28-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> maybe @jl777c can reimburse? or would that be symptom treatment

[28-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> someone either has CHIPS in the switching algorithm and doesn't realize what they are doing

[28-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Give me address 
Will update

[28-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> or is deliberately attacking us

[28-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @grewalsatinder http://chips.komodochainz.info/

[28-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Okay will use it's IP

[28-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> if it is someone doing it unknowingly, maybe we just hardfork to get rid of them and hope they don't come back?

[28-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> that'd be a temporary solution

[28-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> literally just change the client version

[28-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @un Haiduc feel like unstalling the chain? üôè

[28-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> who is un Haiduc? is he the reincarnation of computergenie?

[28-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> Because of equihash miners coming in tomorrow, I have 0 sha miners that aren't in boxes awaiting shipment to our larger location; so, there's nothing I can do, currently.

[28-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> if your stratum is still up @Alright i'll point my little usb asic's back
