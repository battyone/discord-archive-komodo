[dscrd-chips] <miningpools (miningpools.cloud)> 179 messages!, pool verushash compile üòÑ

[30-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> does this mean hardfork?

[30-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miningpools (miningpools.cloud)> this is correct git ? https://github.com/miketout/chips3/tree/verushash

[30-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> it will, but it needs a height activation once it has been tested to actually work

[30-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> The first step was this, getting it to compile with verushash functions. Now someone needs to set chipsd to use verushash function and connect 2 nodes, they should go on a hard fork as soon as they connect to each other. I would advise doing it in a VM, I can try to get onto this, if nobody else can, but I am busy on scaletest stuff now, and dont want to leave that until its all finished.

[30-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miningpools (miningpools.cloud)> the idea to move chips to verushash it's a great solution for me. Max number of chips remain the same ( 21 mln ) ?

[30-Aug-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @blackjok3r you should get back to scaling

[30-Aug-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i'll try to build it and maybe @grewalsatinder and me can get it to work together

[30-Aug-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i did a `autogen.sh` successfully on OS X and now in configure phase

[30-Aug-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> sweet there is plenty of people on this. Thanks for finising it off guys, the bounty was only set at 5000, chips but james said it could be higher. I am fine with 2000 for my part, it was only an afternoon and I learnt a fair bit.

[30-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> we'll ask the bounty manager to pay out a bounty.

[30-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> oh wait...

[30-Aug-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> ```In file included from src/cryptoconditions.c:14:
./src/json_rpc.c:4:10: fatal error: 'malloc.h' file not found
#include <malloc.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~~```

[30-Aug-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> happens on make on mike's branch, could be an OS X issue

[30-Aug-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> iirc thats what stops nheqminer for verushash from building on osx too

[30-Aug-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> any extra dependencies i need?

[30-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> gcc 6?

[30-Aug-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> that was one of the build errors I was getting.

[30-Aug-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> oh i was on the wrong repo

[30-Aug-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Try mike‚Äôs repo
verushash branch

[30-Aug-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> was someone able to build it?

[30-Aug-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> `./chipsd -algo=verushash`?

[30-Aug-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> if it's `ac_algo` then it's wrong since chips isn't an assetchain

[30-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> all right, got it built

[30-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @grewalsatinder up for a test?

[30-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Late late night. M on mobile only

[30-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Tomorrow will try

[30-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> If not traveling

[30-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> ok, no worries

[30-Aug-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> @dukeleto Linux compiles fine. Other OS's should have been the same as before, but that is an OSX header issue.

[30-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> likely from something else than these changes, as nothing related to core headers should have changed at all

[30-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> OS X is like the uncle you never invited to the party

[30-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> was it working on OSX before?

[30-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> good question. I am pretty sure c-lightning works on OS X, but not sure if CHIPS preserved that

[30-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i have compiled c-lightning on OS X recently

[30-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> my guess is that there would be no differences in supported OS's from the VerusHash change

[30-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i probably am the first person to try compiling CHIPS on os x

[30-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i am crazy like that

[30-Aug-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i think i've beat you to it. i had a CLI version of chips on osx, that much for sure.

[30-Aug-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> that ended however when i switched back to linux 2 months ago

Hello. Anyone here looking to work on a dice contract gui?

[09-Sep-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator you should have a go at that, I can help with it, I have logic for how to play the game mostly done but its coded in bash script only.

[09-Sep-18 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Happy to work on front end and linkage.

[09-Sep-18 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
been playing with vue lately, but got sidetracked tweaking the scale vis

[09-Sep-18 12:33 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
once that's green lit through tests, ready to dive into the next thing

thanks, I ended up following this to compile chipsd https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2078449.msg20793493#msg20793493  I guess there aren't binaries around.

gentleman, is there a working block explorer somewhere?

im stuck trying to "make" lighting. Keep getting a libbacktrace/configure: not found

[23-Sep-18 04:38 PM] jorian#4555
@jspook16 you need to add it manually

[23-Sep-18 04:39 PM] jorian#4555
@sg777 is the above still not fixed or does @jspook16 have the wrong branch?

[23-Sep-18 04:40 PM] jorian#4555
Btw, the bot is not linked to the chips discord anymore

[25-Sep-18 12:06 AM] jspook16#3059
thanks @jorian  I will have to look at this again this weekend

[28-Sep-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kpprabhu> can we move the chips from coinexchange to wallet. is it safe perform this operation now ?

[28-Sep-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> we need the same kind of hype for CHIPS as now with PIRATE üòÑ

[28-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> actually chips would be perfect to be full zksnarks like pirate

[28-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> private chips

[28-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> but maybe not allways? before a gmae you need to sometimes show you have sth to play with?...

[28-Sep-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> but on the other hand you could make a deposit to special account to prove yourself... situation will be more interesting when CC comes to pirate... then maybe no use on other then non private chains

[28-Sep-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> PS I dont not exactly believe pirates value will grow and last untill it will get true CEX liquidity and some wider usage

[28-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> and CEXes are not sure as govs will preffer to close full private chain - money loundry as first usage will come for sure

[28-Sep-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> so some way of decentralized market will be needed anyway

[28-Sep-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> Chips uses CC and I believe pirate can't do that.

[28-Sep-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> but will in the future

[28-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> PIRATE wont ever get CC

[04-Oct-18 07:45 PM] mobipoi#5774

[08-Oct-18 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kpprabhu> Hey guys, chips wallet is halted on coinexchange. Can anything be done about that ?

[10-Oct-18 04:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.   

DM me for the link and I will get you setup with the creator.

this seems to be pretty dead - where did Pangea actually go?!?!

I'll leave this to someone else...

[20-Oct-18 07:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
Thanks! - I am on the CHIPS discord anyway ... I was just wondering about the work Mr.E did for tha Pangea GUI some time ago and hoping it could be salvaged because it sort of .. went away
