As some people know, on top of working as an Entrepreneur, I am now General Partner at Starchain.capital. I am convince that a successful ecosystem need outside money to grow. I will spend some time everyday here to help entrepreneurs that are looking to build projects on Komodo platform. We will also work on adding here other VC friends. Komodo has a great community and a great tech, let's push it. @Bitcoin Benny and I share the same vision. Cheers

@Fab√ò so what exactly is this channel for? Is it to find projects within the ecosystem which could use funding and leverage your position at starchain.capital and other vc to help them out?

[23-Jun-19 10:56 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Yep I thing the goals are #1 to provide support to whom has an idea and technical skills but never build a business from the ground up (growth plan, legal, marketing, financials, management) #2 provide feed back to whom needs financial support to build an mvp or to help scaling

Need to put my head around it but seems to be big

[30-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Raising money from LPs and deploying capital is very costly automation could lead to finance more projects and solve scalability issues. This is big

[30-Jun-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it allows to onboard new users in seconds, with a fully validated blockchain

[30-Jun-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so speed of an API wallet like electrum, but the cryptographic proofs that is almost as good as a full node

[30-Jun-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
2GB+ of data needed reduced to 20kb

[30-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Fab√ò#8941
This is brillant congrats

[30-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Fab√ò#8941
How could we take it from here (building a mvp)?

[30-Jun-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to add nSPV support to an SPV wallet, and also make some small changes to the daemon to support it

[30-Jun-19 02:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Fab√ò try BreadWallet on your iOS or Android Wallet. There is a core library of that BreadWallet in C language open source, available on Github. It is very possible to upgrade that library to have nSPV supported. But that needs some C dev who's capable to understand that and nSPV requirements, and upgrade that code to make it nSPV supported.
Once it's supported all sorts of Mobile to Desktop nSPV supported applications can be built. The same exact lib can be then also be used for AtomicDEX in its backend.

[30-Jun-19 02:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But, for that you have to make a team assembled who can do this task.

[30-Jun-19 02:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Read my few chat lines in #ask-jl777

[30-Jun-19 02:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it will clear you some things on it

[30-Jun-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not that much work given a dev who can update breadwallet

[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Used for AtomicDEX this is BIG @grewalsatinder

[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Well we need to showcase this

[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is an existing SPV wallet for zcash, that would speed things up

[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
True üôÇ

[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it does solve the problem of supporting millions of users

[30-Jun-19 02:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Fab√ò using that bread wallet lib is basically eliminate the need of setting up Electrum Servers, which also costs money and time to maintain, and also not as equals to the decentralisation as the actual peer to peer network of the blockchain itself. So, that's in my opinion is multiple times superior solution to build.

[30-Jun-19 02:41 PM] Fab√ò#8941
A platform need to allow Millions of users if not hundred of millions it is the only way to scale and to create a valuable ecosystem

[30-Jun-19 02:41 PM] Fab√ò#8941
To me that start with financing and basis financial tools üõ†

[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Fab√ò#8941
As we need to take care of the people that build this ecosystem

[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Fab√ò#8941
I am not a dev but I am committed to bring people in and partnerships

[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Fab√ò#8941
For that we gonna need docs and mvp

[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can help with project/product management regarding that breadwallet lib if you need help.
I can definitely help define the tasks and guide the devs who wants to pick this task.

[30-Jun-19 02:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I don't have to good grasp of C/C++, I just know what needs to be done where to go to get what a dev need to get things started with.

[30-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@jl777c good with that ?

[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV wallet wont be a direct revenue generator

[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
support for it would allow any ecosystem coin to ramp up to million(s) of users, just using its p2p network

[30-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Right this model I agreed won‚Äôt create direct revenue but will bring users and projects which impact the value of our ecosystem and bring inflation (versus other assets) which is a form of relative money creation (increase in purchase power)

[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i think a proof of concept would start with an existing SPV wallet, add support for zcash protocol if it doesnt already have it, and then add the nSPV speedups

[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Amen

[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
üôè

[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the server side, we can just do on demand as it is just making some p2p message handler for existing rpc calls

[30-Jun-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be a month or two worth of work for an experienced dev.

[30-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Make sense

[30-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Who will act as a product manager

[30-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Fab√ò#8941
(I don‚Äôt try to assume that it will be you)

[30-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
*who sorry

[30-Jun-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i can help with what exactly needs to be done, but best if somebody else takes responsibility to get all the various things done

[30-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Copy that thanks JL

[30-Jun-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so we need an SPV wallet dev to customize breadwallet or equivalent

[30-Jun-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i can make sure the server side is done internally

[30-Jun-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and somebody to manage the miniproject

[30-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Fab√ò#8941

To me @grewalsatinder the best option would be to create a nSPV channel

[30-Jun-19 02:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The idea would be to take the changes done in iOS wallet to the breadwallet core, so this core can be used in different GUI applications, so it is not just limited to this breadwallet iOS or Android UI forks.
