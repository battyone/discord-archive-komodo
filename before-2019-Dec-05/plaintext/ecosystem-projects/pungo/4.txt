@gsnew let me know, if top bar runs and runs seems like electrum servers might not be responding, but I just tried and works fine for me

[27-Dec-18 02:18 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I fee appears it means electrum server is responding. If fee doesnt appear that might be the issue. Might also depend on your physical location, let me know more info and retry again

hi

[28-Dec-18 06:25 PM] RNI#2666
got 100pgt on pungowallet .. from an earlier airdrop

[28-Dec-18 06:26 PM] RNI#2666
trying to transfer them to agama but it says "connection error. please try again".. 🤔

[28-Dec-18 06:29 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hi there @RNI I suggest you to update wallet. Please make sure you have backed up the 24 secret word list (24, not less!)

[28-Dec-18 06:32 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
uninstall and install again the wallet. For some comments I have been getting seems reinstall should do the trick. Just checked and PGT is working fine

[28-Dec-18 06:35 PM] RNI#2666
thanks! you're right..i'm not having latest pungowallet. will update and try again

[28-Dec-18 06:45 PM] RNI#2666

me and @Senda  we put theorders, but do not see each other in hyperdex

[28-Dec-18 09:51 PM] SadykovT#2123
who made the trade ?

[28-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Senda#7983
nop 😦

[28-Dec-18 10:02 PM] SadykovT#2123
I think it was a test swap when adding a token to Hyperdex.

[28-Dec-18 10:06 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes also thought about it

[28-Dec-18 10:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
guys, there's something very strange in Agama wallet. I read about the airdrop so I added Pungo in native mode, or I believed it was, it has green logo with the name Pungo (PGT). It downloaded the blockchain pretty fast, but then the orange symbol 'native' changed to the green 'erc20' . From the activate coin menu there's a Puregold Token (PGT) , it seems a conflict between it and Pungo

[28-Dec-18 10:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
in fact they have the same logo

[28-Dec-18 10:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I must have added the wrong one

[28-Dec-18 10:44 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I was actually adding it in light mode and couldnt find it

[28-Dec-18 10:44 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but guess I should switch to native mode

[28-Dec-18 10:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I was using native, maybe in lite mode it works

[28-Dec-18 10:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I found that if I try adding Pungo in native it always add the Erc20 one

[28-Dec-18 10:48 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I have used in lite mode, seems problem is in native, will try now

[28-Dec-18 10:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
restarted Agama, same issue. Both have same logo and ticker and it adds the Erc20 with either choice

[28-Dec-18 11:14 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
agama marks it as ERC20 but just sent PGT and it gets it

[28-Dec-18 11:14 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hehe

@Senda

[28-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Senda#7983
I don't understand

[28-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Senda#7983
I see orders on other coins

[28-Dec-18 11:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
let me check again

[28-Dec-18 11:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
the thing is I dont see any coin offers

[28-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Senda#7983
On ZEC i see buy orders for example

[28-Dec-18 11:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I think I saw yours before

[28-Dec-18 11:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
let me check

[28-Dec-18 11:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
@Senda

[29-Dec-18 12:03 AM] Senda#7983
My buy offer is 0'4 kmd for 1 pgt

[29-Dec-18 12:04 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
this one seems different

[29-Dec-18 12:04 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
its a sell offer to sell pgt

[29-Dec-18 01:25 AM] Van#5829
hey guys, how to claim the airdrop on agama wallet?

[29-Dec-18 01:31 AM] Senda#7983
@Van you don't have to claim nothing. It was snapshot on 10th december to agama wallets with +10 kmd

[29-Dec-18 02:00 AM] Van#5829
i believe i have more than 10 kmd on the date of the snapshot, but i dont see any pgt tokens when activating pgt native mode on my agama

[29-Dec-18 02:37 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

might be agama glitch with pgt

[29-Dec-18 02:37 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
or switch to lite pgt on agama

[29-Dec-18 03:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah no tokens here either. I will try the light version or wait for agama update

[29-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Van#5829
do i need to reimport my private keys to the agama in order to get the airdrop?

[29-Dec-18 11:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I see them on atomicexplorer, havent tried agama yet, thanks!

[29-Dec-18 01:45 PM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
what was the date of snapshot ?

[29-Dec-18 02:38 PM] Van#5829
can someone give insight to my missing airdrop?

[29-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Senda#7983
snapshot on 10th december @discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh

and how many Pungo were given per 1 KMD ?

[30-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Instel7#1416
Someone here? One user called @jony#9693 wrote on Chainzilla's "General-discussion" channel, he said that pungo "stole" his zilla from your wallet. His profile looks weird. I thought he was a bot for his profile picture but apparently not. It would be nice if some of you guys could read what he wrote, you can access to the discussion without leaving komodos channel, joining #chainzilla

[30-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Senda#7983
@Instel7 yes it's something strange. And now he say it's closed without no explanation...

[30-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Senda#7983
@discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh  they airdroped 10 pungo to all addresses with more than 10 kmd

oh

[30-Dec-18 09:47 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
10 Pungo

[30-Dec-18 09:47 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
ok

[30-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Instel7#1416
Yes @Senda it's a little weird

[30-Dec-18 09:50 AM] Instel7#1416
Here at my country is late and I have to go, let me know if you can figure something 👍

[30-Dec-18 09:51 AM] Senda#7983

[30-Dec-18 05:05 PM] jspook16#3059
@Senda yeah it definitely was NOT the the pungo wallet. I think it was user error

{Reactions}
👌 

[30-Dec-18 05:47 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @Instel7 jony reinstalled the wallet and worked fine

[30-Dec-18 05:56 PM] Elmis#0347
I cant find any token of the airdrop in my Agama wallet . Did you have to fulfill any other condition besides having more than 10 kmd to receive the airdrop?

[30-Dec-18 05:58 PM] Elmis#0347
Do the kmd stored in Ledger wallet also participate in the airdrop?

[30-Dec-18 05:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
have you checked in explorer?

[30-Dec-18 06:12 PM] Elmis#0347
Does it mean anything?

[30-Dec-18 06:37 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
in agama? there is some issue about way handles PGT make sure to be in lite mode and maybe logoff login again

[30-Dec-18 06:38 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
seems it tags it as ERC20 but as far as I tested I was able to receive and send

[30-Dec-18 06:38 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
guess that should be fixed in new version team was already reported
