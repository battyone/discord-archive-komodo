Thanks for the reply @kimmel (Pungo.io)  @bishop . No problem at my end, it all looks good, but this is why I always test my initial investments. Cheers

[18-Sep-18 01:24 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
please contact me directly if you might be able to help

[18-Sep-18 01:47 PM] hastrup#8742
i was able to buy flawless thanks!!  how do you become PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICE i se that crypto.com i having a relly hard time to delivier

[18-Sep-18 02:04 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
thanks for your trust @hastrup we have different plans, we hope to be able to push them forward after the sale ends

[18-Sep-18 02:07 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
payment processing service can be done in many countries, we have some places in mind where it seems likely; however we will need some backing to advance steadily on our plans. As you know we are releasing different products, depending on the amount raised we will need to rely on our products revenue also to fund our expansion 😃

[18-Sep-18 02:26 PM] hastrup#8742
Ok thx I'm looking forward to see you advancements in the field I'm selling out of my mco holding because you give me my privat key so thx to you for giving me the power to controle my own money and the ability to buy a tomato whit them 😁

[18-Sep-18 03:51 PM] hastrup#8742
I'm a little confused. The buy back fund that gives 0,50 usd back. So if I give 1 btc for x amount of pgt and the price on btc goes to the roof . Can I buy back my btc for the same price?

[18-Sep-18 03:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
let me try to explain. Revenue from our products goes to FUND. Right?

[18-Sep-18 03:52 PM] hastrup#8742
Yes

[18-Sep-18 03:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
this FUNDS can only be used to Buyback Pungo tokens

[18-Sep-18 03:52 PM] hastrup#8742
Yes

[18-Sep-18 03:53 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so you can sell PGT on any exchange that supports them...or come to us and we will buy them back with the funds accumulated in the FUND.

[18-Sep-18 03:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
So for example, if we accumulate crypto in the FUND, and the value of this crypto is 10 million USD

it means that we can buy back to any one who requests to do so, at 1 USD/PGT

[18-Sep-18 03:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
So for example, if we accumulate crypto in the FUND, and the value of this crypto is 10 million USD

it means that we can buy back to any one who requests to do so, at 1 USD/PGT, as there are 10 million PGT (imagine all are distributed)

[18-Sep-18 03:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however the idea is that this FUND is here so every token holders can be sure that there is something backing TOKEN VALUE

[18-Sep-18 03:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if our business goes good, FUND keeps increasing as the time passes

[18-Sep-18 03:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
which is something I find totally logic...btw

[18-Sep-18 03:56 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if you see the "revenue fee" is similar to the one most exchanges apply, 0.2% per operation

[18-Sep-18 03:56 PM] hastrup#8742
Ok I see. Is the fund open to see? How much it hold?

[18-Sep-18 03:56 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
it means everyone trading on our platform...we take that small piece and send to the FUND

[18-Sep-18 03:57 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes, the FUND data will be published by https://openingchain.org

Ok thx :)

[18-Sep-18 03:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
they will publish the FUNDS stored, where those funds come from, how many PGT we (as a company) hold, how do we give a way the PGT we control...

[18-Sep-18 03:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so basically they will publish everything related to how we handle things. You can take a look at our paper at https://pungotoken.com

[18-Sep-18 03:58 PM] hastrup#8742
So it could be 2usd/pgt. whatever the fund hold devided by coin supply?

[18-Sep-18 03:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
rigth

[18-Sep-18 03:59 PM] hastrup#8742
Thx :)

[18-Sep-18 03:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if we accumulate 20 million, its 2 usd/pgt

[18-Sep-18 03:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however I would say that market will probably trade over "real price"

[18-Sep-18 03:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
depending on expectations

[18-Sep-18 04:00 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if FUND holds 1usd/pgt but we are doing great...market would expect value to grow fast so probably it will be better for any holder to sell in the open market...

[18-Sep-18 04:00 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
well, if it happens with coins backed by...nothing...I guess that a coin backed by a real value behind should perform much better

[18-Sep-18 04:00 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
😃

[18-Sep-18 04:05 PM] hastrup#8742
Yes I see. I just have a friend that pointed out that he was not that willing to use his btc in the event that btc goes back up and I can understand his concern. Therefore I will buy back the kmd I have used on pgt. So it's the Fiat I have used and not my kmd holdings. But thx for the explanation. I understand now 😊

[18-Sep-18 04:35 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
cool, btw you can buy KMD on https://peer2.cash by bank transfer quite easily 😃

[18-Sep-18 04:39 PM] hastrup#8742
Thx I will check it out to see if your rates are near bitpanda :) then I will definitely buy from peer2.cash :)

but actual price 0.4 usd
time to update the sale page😄

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] pbca26#5430
also, just noticed the same issue i had while working on new version of agama mobile
>Uncaught SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode
either you forked too early or not in sync with the latest
i think it might be relevant on old phone models/browsers
but i'm not 100% positive on what's the cause
compiling everything inc. agama-wallet-lib to es5 fixes the issue

[18-Sep-18 08:57 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

[30-Sep-18 07:59 PM] bishop#9773
To measure the interest in the token, is it safe to just monitor the top address on the richlist to know how many tokens have been purchased? Last I checked, there wasn't a tracker on the website.

[01-Oct-18 09:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @bishop we havent set a counter because the PGT backed price will be set only on tokens officially sold/airdropped

[01-Oct-18 10:01 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
that means non distributed tokens wont count. And we guarantee we wont sell PGT in markets under 0.5 usd and if we sell over that price, ie 0.6 usd/PGT at a later occasion we will send this extra 0.1 usd/pgt directly to public fund

[01-Oct-18 11:14 PM] bishop#9773
I was mainly interested to see if/when you sell the entire token sale or if there is a lack of interest.
