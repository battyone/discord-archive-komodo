[01-Jan-19 02:26 AM] Regnar#6164
I just submitted PGT to be listed on Coinpaprika including links to white paper, linkedin of team members, block explorers, API endpoints for circulating supply, coin icon (from BarterDEX github).

[01-Jan-19 02:28 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure if PGT is on other exchanges yet besides BarterDEX/HyperDEX but the information for them there is incomplete. So Idk how they will list it with markets/price without that information. I'll see if I can update that stuff as well.

[01-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Regnar#6164
But it might be only possible to list if PGT is on an exchange with price information.

[01-Jan-19 01:44 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @Regnar thats great we are setting up links/repos to start gettig listed sometime soon

you might want to change the port

[09-Jan-19 02:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
does it cause issues?

[09-Jan-19 03:00 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
not sure why we set this one, its just the one we are using right now but if it needs to be changed for a good reason can be changed

[09-Jan-19 03:01 PM] jorian#4555
KMD uses that one

[09-Jan-19 03:02 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so it creates some kind of incompatibility?

[09-Jan-19 03:03 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes wait a moment I think thats not correctly set

[09-Jan-19 03:03 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[09-Jan-19 03:04 PM] jorian#4555
if i use KMD as electrum i cant use PGT anymore

[09-Jan-19 03:04 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ok so only when setting up all electrum servers together?

[09-Jan-19 03:05 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
guess from a mobile client doesnt care where remote electrum has the port set right?

[09-Jan-19 03:10 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I mean, I understand we cannot set 2 electrum servers on port 10001 because only one would work

[09-Jan-19 03:11 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but from a light wallet point of view, I guess it shouldnt care calling Server A for coin A on port 10001 and Server B for Coin B on port 10001

[09-Jan-19 03:12 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
btw I think I missed the port and checking with devops because seems port its 10002 😃

[09-Jan-19 03:13 PM] jorian#4555
it's your mobile application using that port

[09-Jan-19 03:13 PM] jorian#4555
hmm. i don't remember actually

[09-Jan-19 03:13 PM] jorian#4555
but there is a reason

[09-Jan-19 03:14 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I just sent PR with updated ports

[09-Jan-19 03:18 PM] jorian#4555
@cipi knows

[09-Jan-19 03:21 PM] cipi#4502
as long as the hostname is another one, it does not matter, you can use same port
on the server it does matter, you can't tell 2 daemons to use the same port

[09-Jan-19 03:35 PM] cipi#4502
explorer link is this PR is wrong, i guess: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/229/files
GUI add txid to the link from explorers/PGT and expects to get the transaction
should be something like `["https://explorer.pungotoken.com/tx/"]`

Hi team, I sent my pungo tokens to my agama wallet. Now I get the error message: Connection error! Trying to switch to another sever.

Are my tokens lost or what can you do now?

[12-Jan-19 11:59 AM] TLMTroublemaker#2623
can i do now

[12-Jan-19 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
@TLMTroublemaker check up ^^. Use the mobie app by Pungo

[12-Jan-19 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
or, if you want to use Agama, use Pungo Native mode

[12-Jan-19 12:11 PM] TLMTroublemaker#2623
Thx @SHossain I will check it out and use both, like Pungo and Komodo 😉

[12-Jan-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
@TLMTroublemaker try Agama lite mode now. should be working
