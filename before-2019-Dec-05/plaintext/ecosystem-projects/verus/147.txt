[dscrdvrsc] <Zero C00L> i7 6700 getting 8mh sound right?

[20-Apr-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me check the pinned excel spreadsheet from #cpu-hashrate for that.

[20-Apr-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> reported hashrate for that CPU vary between 4.7 and 10 MHs

[20-Apr-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So, 8 MHs sounds fine

[20-Apr-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zero C00L> Ok thanks.  Just joined the discord a few min ago, so wasn't aware of that pinned

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> NP. I saw you entering

[20-Apr-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zero C00L> so FPGAs are heavy here?

[20-Apr-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, not really. The only FPGA out there is from hashaltcoin, the F1 & F1+

[20-Apr-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But for those machines other algo's are more profitable...

[20-Apr-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We are all anxiously awaiting the release on the UKminer V1

[20-Apr-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If they deliver what they promise, it should do 70MHs @ 80Watts, which is better than the most efficient CPU now (Ryzen 2600 , 17.5 MHs @ 65W)

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i think i was lucky to get that bio. wayback engine has a dozen or so "captures" only one of which  worked

[20-Apr-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @gigamesh As one of the creators of Microsoft .NET - one of the worlds most popular frameworks for programmers after Java - Mike has a pretty impressive background for sure.

[20-Apr-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> Maybe we should focus on the project itself,PBaaS......

[20-Apr-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Wow. Impressive resume (understatement).

[20-Apr-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> that's only part of the resume, there is even more interesting stuff to discover, like 3D printing electrical circuits etc. yes @Ted i agree "the code speaks for itself", but if you don't code (like me) that doesn't help so much. So you research what you can. Learning a bit about Mike's past has been a real treat. I mean, he helped build Microsoft.

[20-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you find the 3D printing YouTube video?

[20-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> In line with the recent rumblings of more awareness for our great little project that could, and the community's efforts to that end, I have  a question about veruscoin.io. Has there been any discussion about updating/upgrading it? It is the first destination most people will go to learn about our project, and the biggest aggregated source of more data and knowledge on the project- it directs people to the code, whitepaper and vision paper, the wallet, all social media, etc. Being the main landing point for all newcomers, I was wondering if others thought it needs more? I know it's not a priority, compared to the actual work of building the whole point of the website itself, but is it considered important enough by the team and community to get a facelift and upgrade?

[20-Apr-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I ask, having zero technical skills helpful to building websites, btw.

[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> I have a little side bit of Verus that I want to keep safe for a rainy day, is there any material risk in keeping this balance in a wallet that I have the pass phrase for, but nothing else (no wallet.dat)...? Seems a coldish type option?

[21-Apr-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ABK as long as the passphrase is sufficiently strong and you really can't lose/forget it, it should be fine. if anything happens to your memory, of course, then it's gone.

[21-Apr-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> @miketout it‚Äôs the seed phrase that generates the private keys in the wallet, guessing this would be secure? Yes major risk is then losing the paper it‚Äôs written on...

[21-Apr-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> @miketout congrats on this project too, it‚Äôs shaping up amazingly well

[22-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ABK thank you! As I said, it‚Äôs a community effort, and I think this is just the beginning. Maybe I misunderstand your question. You cannot reconstruct the whole wallet from just the HD seed in the wallet. There is a way to generate the Sapling addresses, but only the Sapling addresses are HD. I would recommend either keeping your funds in one address, for which you have the private key, or backing up your wallet or wallet dump file (see z_expoerwallet).
