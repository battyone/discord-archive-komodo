[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> PBaaS is like a rusted out frame on a truck.  No joke Hardcore.   Need to know when to walk away knuckles busted....  and come back rested with a blow torch  and patience! üòõ

[29-Jan-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Coinminer> Anyone know the Transactions Per Second of the Verus Blockchain? Obviously it hasn‚Äôt been under any real load yet, a theoretical estimation would be great.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Chazmainian Devil your comments are baseless, as is your false pretense of knowing anything about me or my motivation around work, and FUD around PBaaS. there is no burnout happening, and PBaaS is looking more like the next generation of Teslas than your description

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> OK, I reread your posts, @Chazmainian Devil. maybe, as I thought at first, you are well meaning. i am ok, and thank you for your concern, if that's what it is. i will interpret your comparison to the truck frame as hard work and taking breaks, not saying PBaaS could really be compared to something in bad shape. it's in good shape and coming along nicely.

[29-Jan-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @miketout sounds more immature than malicious, methinks.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @basti @kristof_profiteers aacoin recently got a bit of a bad feedback around here. DP may be the better choice.

[dscrdvrsc] <kristof_profiteers> Tried sending 1  verus to Dp. Almost 20h and it hasn't arrived . Anyone tried deposing vrsc to digitalprice

[30-Jan-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> i had a slight problem this morning with dp, but to there defence i think it was either a time issue ( just needed longer to go through ) or human error on this end , thankfully all coins are now present in my friends wallet so all is good

[30-Jan-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz (Not Giving Away BTC)> @kristof_profiteers  Check the explorer?

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Looking at the dumpster fire Cryptopia has turned into, I'm suddenly glad they dragged their feet so long on listing Verus....

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Just a thought lately:
I have been seeing LOTS of Fake Stake Articles coming out. 
Any resources I can point people to for verus solution and an introduction to these people?

[31-Jan-19 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Also, this morning DigitalPrice announced they had wallet display issues.  
"Should be fixed" but ask them in their discord if you still can't get anywhere.

[31-Jan-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> @miketout mike, so for the uninitiated (like myself)

What's the difference between transparent and sapling? Other than privacy (I think) why would it matter if you use either on an exchange?

[31-Jan-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @FishyGuts I haven't heard from DP about a display issue. Was it with Verus? Also, there is not a known fake stake attack on Verus. We check all parts of the stake transaction before storing a block, which prevents propagation, and any header only attack on individual nodes also requires PoW, which is a benefit of the hybrid approach. I also plan to put a better-than-pow solution to even a targeted header attack in the PBaaS upgrade.
@jbates58 I have asked if CryptoBridge will support both transparent and Sapling out, which they should be able to do. If so, mobile wallets will be supported for withdrawal before they also support z-transactions. z-transactions on input would mean that to send Verus to the exchange, you would need a native wallet until we or someone adds z-transaction support to a mobile wallet that supports Verus. That is planned, but we will likely focus on PBaaS over mobile z-transactions until the Zcash z-transaction wallet is finished as well. They are taking the same approach we would take anyhow.
The arguments for would be privacy for all exchange users in and out. The argument against would be privacy for all exchange users in and out as well as needing a native wallet to send coins to the exchange. For example,

[31-Jan-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> great

[31-Jan-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> since z-tx mostly make sense having big pool of shielded tx, I watch Verus as a coin where z-tx are just a bonus not so much in use in reality

[31-Jan-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> while there is a difference between t-tx and z-tx maintanance  t-tx are more important it seems in this context ?

[31-Jan-19 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Hey @FishyGuts, nice to see u in our discord. I hope u hang out more here. Also, I'm looking forward to u interviewing mike about PBaas.

[31-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> I voted thump Up. I like the function to use z adress for Exchange. But the native mode is not for mass adoption. This could scare off some investors who are unfamiliar with it. Still support from me. You have  to go new ways.

[31-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> I would wait until the zdeposit/zwithdraw is stable before enabling it.

[31-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> also exchange -> exchange wont work if one requires zaddr

[31-Jan-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> staking used to be `mining with 0 threads`

[31-Jan-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook so we cant stake on new wallet or we cant mine right

[31-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> `-mint` is the goto way iirc

[31-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jan-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jan-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and this is the `coin control` interface

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> fuck doing that via json on commandline

[31-Jan-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> you can mine or stake or both on the GUI @GlorymanRTS

[31-Jan-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> it works

[31-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I've tested it

[31-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> does it work for anyone else?

[31-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> check your debug.log

[31-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> how did you get it to work?

[31-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> when I run gui, and use the CLI to look at the feedback, I can see it stake or mine depending on my GUI settings

[31-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it should say 'verusstaker enabled' or similar

[31-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and it should say so on the bottom end
