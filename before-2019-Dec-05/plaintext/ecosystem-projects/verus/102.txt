[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The charts do look rather loaded tbh

[16-Jan-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I feel like something has to pop with vrsc trading soon. The order books are the fullest I have seen but with the lowest volume of trades

[16-Jan-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> More than they have in a while

[16-Jan-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Sorry I didn't mean to misquote you

[16-Jan-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> What I meant is that the order books on the exchanges are getting pretty stacked, but few trades are taking place so it would seem like something will break out one way or the other

[16-Jan-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have not seen as many orders on the books as I am now. Especially on dp

[16-Jan-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Stex is pretty dead though

[16-Jan-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This is my only point.
I think the purpose of being on CMC is about the same as, announcing projects on Bitcointalk, it's a standard within the community.

[16-Jan-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I don't care about the price

[16-Jan-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> being on cmc is good. Being on a bunch of shittier exchanges though might not be so good

[16-Jan-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> people will judge that

[16-Jan-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You just need to get on one where you can get on CMC

[16-Jan-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Unfortunately, that requires to be listed on an exchange that charges for a listing

[16-Jan-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's a funny system

[16-Jan-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz I agree, it's best to get on as many exchanges for as little as possible

[16-Jan-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman Well there's no point to be on exchanges that have no volume

[16-Jan-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Well, now that Gloryman has chimed in we all know the solution

[16-Jan-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lol

[16-Jan-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's been settled

[16-Jan-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm kidding. Good morning to everyone

[16-Jan-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> What about Korean exchanges?

[16-Jan-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or something like Gate.io?

[16-Jan-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Kyc

[16-Jan-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No US residents can use them

[16-Jan-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> so?

[16-Jan-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> True

[16-Jan-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Let's look into it

[16-Jan-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If the goal is to get on an exchange which is on cmc then that doesn't matter, and it opens up other markets

[16-Jan-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig  Now you're talking

[16-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> A lot of people visit CMC and look at the Recently Added

[16-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> A lot

[16-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And they do it daily

[16-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Any other exchanges come to mind?

[16-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are quite a few basically captive markets which foreigners can't touch-- Japan, Korea are two

[16-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Huobi, OKEX are both pretty big?

[16-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are plenty of questionable exchanges... fcoin, fatbtc(pretty shitty, but I've made some loot from it), bitforex

[16-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> COSS could be an option but I kind of hate them. They have such a hard time dealing with anything which isn't erc20

[16-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> pretty xead

[16-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> dead

[16-Jan-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> indodax

[16-Jan-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I used to love them till they booted US citizens and required kyc

[16-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> no trading fees

[16-Jan-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Bitso is a Mexican exchange. No KYC required

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are a few Mexican exchanges

[16-Jan-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I can't remember the other one though

[16-Jan-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I've only traded on Bitso

[16-Jan-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I kind of miss Bitso. It's pretty great. Deposit cash at any convenience store 24/7, and seconds later buy crypto.

[16-Jan-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Hell, I paid my rent with that exchange too

[16-Jan-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Originally yeah but I haven't lived there for a couple years

[16-Jan-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Kind of pointless if you aren't dealing in MXN though

[16-Jan-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm actually going to delete my comments back to the original one about CMC

[16-Jan-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I don't use Crypto-Bridge exchange, but I'll donate a little to help get VerusCoin listed on more exchanges!

[16-Jan-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I began using it back in October, I'm really trying to use more DEX's in general and they are a pretty cool one...and with cmc and ease of use it could help get VRSC listed on cmc imo

[16-Jan-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I havent really used any exchange since 2017 üòÇ

[16-Jan-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I'm in HODL mode again.

[16-Jan-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ha, nice!

[16-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I sent ~1.37 ZEC and ~250 KMD.  üçÄ  Hope to see Verus get listed!

[16-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I horde my VRSC sorry, i keep üòÇ

[dscrdvrsc] <inkrs> look at the bright side, there's no more "wen cryptopia"

[16-Jan-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Interesting one @Patrick ManBearPig looking at it now

[16-Jan-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Chinese, but it's pretty well known

[16-Jan-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So exciting! Lots of new potential listings, if we all seek out and apply I think together we can get sooo much done!

[16-Jan-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I haven't sold a single red VerusCoin since I started. In fact I sold most of my alts for Verus

[16-Jan-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> The question in 2019 isn't When Binance?, It's When Verus?

[16-Jan-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763

Thanks for all you've done to date to  benefit our project!  ‚ù§

[16-Jan-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thank you again @FishyGuts and @hellcatz as well, awesome.  I'm donating now as well ‚ù§

[16-Jan-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> COSS is looking decent again after the recent upgrade, could be a good option. Otherwise going to pop some money towards the Crypto Bridge listing... Don‚Äôt have a lot but every bit helps I suppose

[16-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thank you @ABK don't know how it will go, but with ARRR being on CB and their idea of co-announcing and getting z-transaction support, we are asking for that as well. I think it would be a pretty big deal to have a DEX supporting z-txs as well. Like I said, this was not part of their original offer, but it can't hurt to ask. Thanks to @FishyGuts of Pirate for the support and idea!

[16-Jan-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> CB is awesome!!!  Exactly 1 year ago I had a bad experience with Craptopia when they took all trading pairs for coins besides BTC down for three months. Shady.. plus rumors about what they do with POS and MN coins -- They would stake all the coins under the one wallet for the coin... and not remove them from staking till someone physically move the coins off the exchange. That can have evil effects on a POS coin. How decentralized is that anyways? If you are a POS or MN coin you are better off sticking to DEX's where that trick is not possible.  Good decision there!! Go VERUS! üòÉ

[16-Jan-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @FishyGuts @miketout thanks and great ideas! Exciting stuff! So donations are open now?

[16-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Wouldn't hurt to ask Cryptopia for a partial refund on their listing fee and also get delisted off of it..Because of what I mentioned above with staking... Taking what you get back, add it to CB funding and disassociate  Verus from Cryptopia completely.  What Cryptopia had happen is not what a new coin wants happening from the start.  Stick with the DEX's  P2P is what it always should have been.

[16-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Chazmainian Devil that is a shame and an interesting point, I never really considered that- large exchanges staking for the coins they hold. I wonder if it would have a large centralizing effect for the larger exchanges

[16-Jan-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Most definitely!   Think about how long people have coins on those exchanges and not in their wallet??? Yikes! Murder for staking coins.

[16-Jan-19 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It would be nice if cryptopia did issue some sort of refund for the deposit but I would be really surprised if that happened and I wouldn't hold my breath for it. Like you said I guess it wouldn't really hurt

[16-Jan-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Chazmainian Devil any idea how many coins are on digital price at any given time? Cryptopia is much larger so I can imagine. This is the first time I've heard that brought up though but it doesn't not make sense

[16-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Yes, doesn't hurt to try to get the fee back but also would be a BIG plus if VERUS was only listed on P2P or DEX exchanges.  All listing a POS coin on a non-P2P exchange does  is devalue the staking coin and centralize it at the same time. All the coins they make is pure profit...and you then can imagine what they could do with price manipulation or when they "Sell" all of those staked coins.

[16-Jan-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes but at the same time it shouldn't be that massive in the scheme of things, like the max amount they'd ever have would have to be a really huge amount staking against the full current total supply to have a centralizing effect

[16-Jan-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  Good point

[16-Jan-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'll contribute. 
Do we still need to be approved?

[16-Jan-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cruz Thanks dude. Me too, count me in as well. I think it would be nice and a good step forward to push the cmc thing

[16-Jan-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  It will bring more people here, a lot. And I'm sure some will be talented & will want to contribute. In my opinion, exchanges have been the financial winners in crypto, up to date. And it's bs that DP isn't on CMC.

[16-Jan-19 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I mean either way I stand behind a listing that will benefit us in the bigger picture and cmc seems to be able to help there so if specifics aren't a huge issue then I'm not too particular, personally

[16-Jan-19 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> @Godballz , it can be major to a new coin that is only listed or first listed on a non DEX...I've seen it happen multiple times now. Besides, it's not like you would be able to prove anything like how much is on a wallet thru block explorer that was actually staking. Especially with this coin.

[16-Jan-19 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well you can't stake from a private address so it should show up on the Block Explorer but that could always be broken down into smaller addresses but I'm not disagreeing I definitely think that's worth considering at least

[16-Jan-19 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not sure which Exchange is being leaned towards or what the best reasons for choosing one would be. I imagine it would be important to have a good-sized one with exposure rather than a no-name one obviously but if the end goal is CMC then it shouldn't matter so much right? And in that case any qualifying one should do

[16-Jan-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So if that's the only reason and the cheaper or free one would be a good option but if that's not the only reason and I would guess that it's always better to have multiple reasons then it might be better to pay the fee and go for the bigger one but if there are free options I guess more than one choice is also possible

[16-Jan-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  Maybe I'm getting you confused with someone. What is your most recent Medium article?

[16-Jan-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Consider DEX only. All you would see in block explorer is small addresses from 500-1000 coins which are called nodes in the Staking world.  On non-DEX exchanges you would have to add all the coins on the exchange up for Sell orders to understand the size of their wallet in coins that they could potentially stake.  Bigger non-Dex  exchange you get the worse it gets and the faster the coin is devalued.  DEX only please!!! üòÉ  I forgot that you also have to add all of the coins on the exchange that do not have a sell order on them too... See how bad the situation snowballs on Non-DEX?

[16-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Non-DEX it is

[16-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> LOL!

[16-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Jk

[16-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Haha

[17-Jan-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I would guess exchanges make more from trading fees than they do from any kind of staking conspiracy, but who knows

[17-Jan-19 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @ABK It's hard to endorse coss when everytime I try to transfer to or from there I basically have to consult a psychic hotline and hope that it shows up in a reasonable time frame or without needing to open a bunch of tickets

[17-Jan-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Patrick ManBearPig  haha that sounds reliable.. and @Cruz since you asked, the Medium  link is- <https://link.medium.com/X19zhgljjT> but the reddit link has a bit more added info too- <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/afj7ae/the_problem_with_pow/> also a different post that briefly explains Verus , meant to catch people's eye and draw them in, in order to simply get the word out in case anyone wants to share or create a similar post to help spread the word- <https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/afgs37/fixing_pow_for_miners_pos_just_wasnt_enough_for/>

[17-Jan-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm going to look into some of those DEXs, haven't really used one but have heard good things. Curious about the usability and layout of these
