[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> But, i did see the pool i mine on change there wallet address , not sure why

[29-Dec-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boss father of all> 52hash works ?

[29-Dec-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boss father of all> or just luckpool ?

[29-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Pretty sure all the pools are uptodate and working

[29-Dec-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> Wow who's getting all the blocks? I have five machine solo Mining and nothing 😦   I have 10 Xeon chips on mining rigs on lucky pool and I have gotten just 4 verus so far 😦

[29-Dec-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> Something definitely doesn't seem right.

[29-Dec-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> We don't even have to compete with GPUs at this time!

[29-Dec-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> My guess is the verus fork marketing campaign worked and got all the verus cpu miners across the world up and running in time for the fork , just a guess though 😎

[29-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> Nah...

[29-Dec-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> Yeah mining solo was a bust and even the pool mining wasn’t worth it, for me. I managed just over 1 vrsc overnight.

[29-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> That was a disappointment... going back to mine Nerva...

[dscrdvrsc] <66tbird> My Agama wallet upgraded to ver. 5 but after clearing it out early this morning the txid can't be found. Things just moving super slow or what?

[29-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @66tbird are you in sync? I’m not sure what the problem is. Do you mean that you had transactions on the old version that aren’t there anymore?

[29-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @miketout The fork would affect staking if everyone else staking forgot to upgrade!

[29-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig true

[29-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <PureHate> can someone hit 2gh after this update ?

[29-Dec-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> With a lot of CPUs

[29-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <PureHate> can  you set 1 worker with a lot of CPUs  on actual mining Pool ? ¨_¨

[29-Dec-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <PureHate> anyway its just dummy qst when you look lot off stats

[29-Dec-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Yes. As long as you don’t name your workers, or use the same name, they all look like one.

[29-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @miketout  is your new asm stuff documented somewhere? If I were to recreate it in C++ I mean? I had your VerusCoin v1 hash running with my own custom made miner client and wanted to try and get v2 running too, but with C++.

[29-Dec-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And code != documentation 😉

[29-Dec-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There are two versions now. One is mostly asm. One emulates the asm and is in C++, but assumes little endian data layout. Right now, Chris is probably 80+% done with a cuda version, and I am about 90% done with a fully Python implementation. Those will be complete before there is any detailed write up. For a while, the code will serve as the documentation with more portable and different versions in progress.

[29-Dec-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> can someone send me a dm to aacoin or a link to there site thanks

[29-Dec-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Well, my day has come to a close and everything has been splendid on my end. Great work on implementing the fork! G'night

[29-Dec-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Good night zpajk , nice work today buddy 😎

[29-Dec-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Tommygun007 https://www.aacoin.com/#/trade?symbol=VRSC_BTC . this is a normal, not referral link. they have a deal for registered accounts until the end of January to participate in the staking pool at a lifetime fee of 1%. after that, they have said it will be 20% staking fee. i keep a little there and get regular returns.

[dscrdvrsc] <Grenwolde> looks like 5 farms have over 50% of the hash

[30-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Grenwolde> need to get those gpu's on

[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> z adresses ?

[30-Dec-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Sapling addresses start with "zs", and are the more advanced private addresses

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crupti moving my last comment here to keep #cpu-hashrate to hashrate postings
i've tried other services' VMs in the past, and I'm convinced that they are often slower than they are supposed to be. some xeons actually do quite well. BTW, I have finished the Python VerusHash 2.0, and it is working, waiting for Electrum testing and deployment. You can see the whole hash here:

[30-Dec-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> sure doesn't seem like decentralization is happening. FPGAs were better than huge CPU mining farms

[30-Dec-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you'd prefer secret mining by a very small number at 20x the best efficiency you can get with commodity equipment that can enable real decentralization? I'm looking forward to GPUs and even seeing what FPGAs can do, but right now, these miners only get a better deal than you due to their own economies of scale. I believe real decentralization happens when an unlimited number of people feel they can compete in mining and staking. At this time, everyone can mine proportionally to the CPUs they control, everyone. It will likely be similar in economics, maybe a little better with GPUs, and we will see what FPGAs do when they come back. Blackminer has said they are working on the algorithm, and there is an interesting other company, who seems to be making a nice offering with the community in mind. I do believe that when FPGAs come back, they will at least come back openly, and everyone will get to make choices with more information. As we saw in the early days of Verus, which also had some large CPU miners, these are likely mostly independent entities, just as the many more miners of smaller hashrate, who now have a chance, collectively make up a much longer tail. i'm just keeping my CPUs pointed at Verus. My GPUs are cold right now.

[30-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> 10% is much less than 75%

[30-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> granted 10% is bigger than 1%, but it is a lot less than 75%

[30-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and before the single fpga pool had about 75% of hashrate, which is above 50% and not a very good thing at all.
with current distribution of hash across various large CPU farms still it seems half the hashrate is from solo miners

[30-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and this is before the GPU come back, so to make any judgements now is premature

[30-Dec-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @miketout @GEBucky   There are valid points to be made on both parts of this decentralization discussion.  I'll still go in favor of the agile developer that pulls off such a smooth fork.  Although, it is discerning to look at hashrates from top-5 miners and realize it's around 1/3 the network hashrate.  All we can do is keep trying.

[30-Dec-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> as opposed to one at 75%?

[30-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> usually when assessing a change, you compare the before vs after, not the after vs theoretical perfection

[30-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and this is very similar to the early days CPU only period. the GPU mining should smooth things out more.

[30-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if the top 5 miners in BTC combined, it would seem to be a lot more than 1/3rd

[30-Dec-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what we are seeing so far is quite amazing result, the proof of the pudding will be the GPU and fpga performance

[30-Dec-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @miketout I am still complexed by the "secret mining" phrase. Nothing secret about it. Came up with a fast algo that ran well on F1 with Verus, and the individuals that owned them did benefit. But wan't some secret corporation. Blackminer just figured out a great solution to your algo, and it was individuals, not corporations mining it. How level is it with the hashrate chart I just put up? I just think it's like putting speed bumps on the buggy path to slow the cars down. It may work short term, but it just seem like a bad strategy and what I see would seem to demonstrate that. I have nothing but respect for your project, the hard work that has gone into it, and the future potential. I think the race to balance between decentralization and innovation is healthy. It will be a continual battle why we are on POW. But we gotta stop with the "secret shit". Yes - people use code names when the get a jump. It's called competing. Not sure Bill Walsh published his playbook every week. 😃

[30-Dec-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> And a FPGA developer will eventually find a 1 Gh/s solution - maybe not Blackminer but someone will. So I admire the goal and respect the vision of the project. Will be interesting to watch those hash rate distributions in the coming months. Socialism is hard to pull off in technology

[30-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The hash to energy consumption will be more economical

[30-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GEBucky This is explained many times over, see #announcements for example. The few FPGAs tried to hide it and didn’t want to cooperate after being exposed, which lead to the algo change to level the playing field instead. And there’s even a bounty out on a open FPGA miner, verus isn’t against FPGAs as a whole.

[30-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's better long term

[30-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> For all of us. The fpga will be back

[30-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hopefully it can still be profitable and more balanced

[30-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I am actually looking forward to when gpus get involved again

[30-Dec-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> hi, i'm just fixing all \o/ my stuffs, expect proper service again before the end of the day

[30-Dec-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @zpajk ya I read it a while ago. lol - "exposed". Kinda like "exposing" the first GPU miner. Evil bastard.

[30-Dec-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it'll take an hour or 3 tho

[30-Dec-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> bootstrap *should* be first, then the alternative explorer, then electrum servers

[30-Dec-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @zpajk cooperate with whom? Perhaps a look at Satoshi's white paper may help. The whole idea behind trustless transactions is not having any alignment between the underlying coin, or the people doing the transactions.

[30-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think it's proper style to mix in some good behaviour with the 'full freedom', thus cooperation at some points seems logical.

[30-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and you can always choose not to be the only one to have a massive advantage and thus not look fishy

[30-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Who do you think is going to "cooperate" in a world where everyone is looking for a technological advantage. This isn't a freaking commune  .

[30-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i do however get your point tho. it's maybe just boiling down to a 'style question' in the end

[30-Dec-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @0x03 fair enough - I think the algo coding freaked people out. But GPU folks do it, FPGA folks do it. Just protecting IP if they came up with a better miner

[30-Dec-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so we're effectively trying to replace the one elitary system ('world financial system') with another, where patents on EVERYTHING will be given out? so to properly participate, you'll have to expose the same properties as in the old system, as a fuckton of money to get enough mining hardware? hahahaha

[30-Dec-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that doesnt make a lot of sense. sadly is partial reality already

[30-Dec-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> I see both sides of this - and have a pretty good stockpile of both FPGAs and GPUs. Concerns me that the battle will be destructive to some really good projects. But Darwin is gonna win here - just life.

[30-Dec-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this one may be an unpopular opinion: we're kind of playing good vs. bad all of the time anyways.

[30-Dec-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> good being the one who plays fair

[30-Dec-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> bad the one who doesnt

[30-Dec-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> think about it, how would the non cheating good win against cheating bad?

[30-Dec-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not going to happen

[30-Dec-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> unless good changes it's ways

[30-Dec-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or the conception of 'good' (over evil) changes in peoples minds

[30-Dec-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> otherwise good is stuck to be the loser forever

[30-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 😃

[30-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but you can still cooperate

[30-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 😛

[30-Dec-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <its> @GEBucky Right now I have a dozen machines on Verus. I have also mined it with GPUs in the past. All the miners I have used have been open source and this seems to be integral in this community. I do have a couple of FPGAs running on different algorithms so I have nothing against FPGAs. At the end of the day, a successful coin has to distribute itself to the widest number of people and enable useful use cases. There is a lot of room for experimentation how to get there.

[30-Dec-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> There isn't a right or wrong here. This debate is essential to the future of crypto, at least POW crypto. But there are a lot of great closed source miners (zenemy, trex, cryptodredge). I don't begrudge them for keeping their IP private and charging a fee. If you don't like it, don't use it. Kinda my thinking there.

[30-Dec-18 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> I haven't seen ios anywhere on github for anyone to download

[30-Dec-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GEBucky Like I wrote before, this has already been explained before. Verus has ment to be a good mix between tech, and they have rightfully done so. FPGA folks weren't playing along, so there was a algo change. This time around they might have a change of heart, maybe not. Then we'll see the state of affairs. Right now you're bringing up the same old arguments before the fork, which aren't speaking to this specific project. g2g pack for a trip.

[30-Dec-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> We will see you soon @zpajk

[30-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <its> @GEBucky Again, it depends on the coin and its community. I have used both open and closed source miners and usually it is not a prime consideration for me but the Verus folks have a slightly different view. I bet they would react the same if a closed CPU miner gave its users 20x advantage.

[30-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> My opinion on the fork is that it went perfectly. 100% of people with a decent cpu and decent electricity rates can compete. We always knew that the Chinese with cheap hardware, cheap electricity and cheap overheads would build farms that are better. With the new GPU miners on the horizon there will be a similar situation where big Chinese gpu farms will have a big advantage. The spreading out the hash rate now is much better. It's pretty much as good the project can realistically make it.

[30-Dec-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Where exactly do you think the folks that have about 60% of the hash on Verus are right now?. Vermont? no. Kansas, no?. Don't get all xenophobic on the Chinese here. Lots of us companies building FPGAs (most are actually US based) and it has very little to do with electricity rates.  Have a look at that hash distribution. There must be 10,000 Threadrippers on Verus right now. they are not super efficient from an electricity perspective.

[30-Dec-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> And I did put 4 very high end CPUs on Verus - and we will see but right now not seeing how you get to the 100% working. I do not want to be  a hater here - but I am a realist. So will see how the hash distribution, and returns work out for CPUs. I will happily report my results.

[30-Dec-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> If it was possible to identify where the big miners (PoW inflation) were coming from,  I imagine a distributed system of the future should be able to block them from reaching more than a total percentage of the hash --  like ddos attackers & cloud flare.
