sure, fixed prices are always possible... but then they are "fixed" üòÑ

[11-Sep-18 09:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
like orders on a centralised exchange, and then you go in and change them when you want to, or write a bot to do it depending on mid market price

[11-Sep-18 09:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
btw, just seen an order pop up

[11-Sep-18 09:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that you?

[11-Sep-18 09:30 AM] cipi#4502
problem is that you will have to change it all the time... may be feasible with 10 coins, but not with 250

[11-Sep-18 09:31 AM] cipi#4502
no, i have not setup VRSC on my bobs

[11-Sep-18 09:31 AM] cipi#4502
i think it is grewal

[11-Sep-18 09:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
hmnnn

[11-Sep-18 09:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
something does seem right anyway

[11-Sep-18 09:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
created an order but it doesn't seem to be getting snapped up

[11-Sep-18 09:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
@grewalsatinder is that your Bob? ‚òù

[11-Sep-18 01:21 PM] jspook16#3059
I will put some up tonight if you still need them

[11-Sep-18 06:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
that would be great

[11-Sep-18 06:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
we've added Verus to HyperDEX in master

[11-Sep-18 06:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's just there aren't any working Bobs

[11-Sep-18 06:10 PM] lukechilds#2707
so no one will actually be able to trade it until there are

[12-Sep-18 01:43 AM] jspook16#3059
I guess those were my offers that were up earlier, i didnt look closely. I have two trades that went through (or at least show complete on my end). Did they show up on your end? @lukechilds

[12-Sep-18 01:46 AM] jspook16#3059
@lukechilds  I also have one "never started" (all these are on barterdex)

[12-Sep-18 01:47 AM] jspook16#3059
@lukechilds let me know if that was you. I'd like to reimburse you since i feel i had the price a bit high

[12-Sep-18 04:55 AM] cipi#4502
i have setup VRSC on one of the mm nodes... pubkey 8adbf9d5de4fb49ec1fca9ca3f28ba384715752de1197c9cddbb756c3d2a1a7c

[12-Sep-18 06:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@lukechilds heh.... I did that bob setup a long time ago. can't be mine.... if it is say hi to it's ghost from me üòÅ

[12-Sep-18 11:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jspook16 nope, wasn't me, none of my VRSC trades went through

[12-Sep-18 11:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
I did get a few `-1000` errors though

[12-Sep-18 11:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
not sure what that error code means but could be "never started"

[17-Sep-18 11:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@cipi is there instructions anywhere to setup some bobs?

Hello! I just started some mining in agama, it says 70 megahashes, is this ok? Will some coins show up in my agama eventually? ü§î  thanks!

[20-Sep-18 03:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
It might take you a while solo mining @Lennart but you can try. You might want to use a pool though

[20-Sep-18 03:34 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I don't think the link to Verus discord is working anymore

[20-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Lennart#9331
I have never mined before

[20-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Lennart#9331
Is there a howto anywhere?

[20-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Lennart#9331
Finding a pool etc

[20-Sep-18 04:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I don't know of any guides. You'll need to download a miner onto your computer.  https://github.com/veruscoin/nheqminer for CPU or https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer for GPU mining.  There is a list of pools on https://veruscoin.io/

Once you download the miner, you basically just input your VRSC address and the url/port of the pool you want to use

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I read things about monero and how they onion there transactions so they are untraceable after that, but im trying to find out why this person iv been speaking to thinks lightening for btc is better, i think but im not that clever on these matters that its not as good as zk-snarks

[23-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Thanks @JohnWestbrook

[23-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @miketout thanks, i do understand this i think, i trust the info iv seen that this is a super private way of transacting or just sharing info, im just still searching online for an answer to how this is much better than this lightening network,

[23-Sep-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @stretcher83 for privacy, nothing beats zero knowledge, because zero knowledge proofs separate the data from the proof of the data. That's why Monero and the ring sig based coins are all moving to bulletproofs or other forms of zero knowledge proofs. Lightning uses the Sphinx protocol, which is basically an improved Tor to provide multiple layers of encryption. This is still encryption of all relevant data, so theoretically, it can eventually be cracked, but to do so is very hard. To perform mathematical operations to ensure that transactions are correct, the lightning network needs to know the values of the transactions, which is another way to correlate who is doing what. This data also isn't used on zero knowledge transactions. While one can argue that Lighting has added a layer of privacy, I don't believe that privacy comes close to the theoretical privacy in zero knowledge systems.

[23-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Thank you mike, that is very clear for me to understand , üëçüèº

[23-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Basically zk-snarks is (zero knowledge proofs)  which transmits no relevant user data ,and the lightening network does not have this, lightening network only encrypts data,  it has data that could be de-crypted , and used against the user in some fashion

[24-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Daiyox> I'm a day late to the party, but for what its worth lightning network I believe is analgous in a very loose / high level way to Komodo's dpow.  It's a network with the ability to record data on a blockchain for record keeping when needed, so 1000 transactions may take place, then a "snapshot" is created on the BTC chain recording that...I'll take Verus / Komodo's method any day over that method, blockchain (Verus)-> blockchain (KMD) -> blockchain (BTC) .. A "Network" with snapshots is great for maybe cryptokitty level stuff, I would't trust my Satoshi's with it though

If any of you guys have a minute to clap and retweet a quick article about a Komodo dICO called Equaliser please do. It will help spread the word about all the coins in the  Komodo ecosystem, as well as add much needed exposure to  Equaliser.

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It looks like you could be on your own chain, im not exactly sure, but we are on agama version 0,3,13c now so your version 0,3,11 is very out dated now, i dont know how many coins you would still have if you get yourself back on the correct chain , maybe some maybe non , its hard to tell without seeing all your transactions

[27-Sep-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It would take you weeks to months to find a block with only 10mh/s

[27-Sep-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @ChrisC30a Yup, most of those coins are probably from wrong chain.

[27-Sep-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Unfortunately probably most of the blocks you have found would be void blocks, not worth anything, you might still have some early blocks that are ok but im not that clever on these things
