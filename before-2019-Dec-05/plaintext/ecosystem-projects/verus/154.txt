[28-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> the answer is in there?

[28-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No sorry I was in the middle of trying to post that

[28-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not sure of the market cap

[28-Apr-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> supply is around 9 mio right?

[28-Apr-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wanted to post this as an easy source to find info on the new stuff

[28-Apr-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Bout 40mil I believe

[28-Apr-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Bit more

[28-Apr-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ah really?

[28-Apr-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> so around 50% has been mined?

[28-Apr-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> or 40% whatever

[28-Apr-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> same emission curve as ARRR?

[28-Apr-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup... about a bit under 50% is still timelocked, so 22M available to trade/stake

[28-Apr-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> was there a halving already or is it coming?

[28-Apr-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 50% was mined, 50% was staked. The PoP algorithm keeps that level

[28-Apr-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Oink tell me about the timelock pls

[28-Apr-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> All blocks with a value over 192VSRC were timelocked and released at a random point within 24 months each.

[28-Apr-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This is done to gradually release the early coins, not to flood the economy

[28-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The actual schedule of release was:
```
Era 1:
Block 0 - 10080 reward: 0 to 384, rising linearly and changing each block
Era 2:
Block 10080 - 53279 reward: 384 Block 53280 - 96479 reward: 192 Block 96480 - 139679 reward: 96 Block 139680 - 182879 reward: 48 Block 182880 - 226079 reward: 24
Era 3:
Block 226080 - 1277279 reward: 24
Block 1277280 - 2328479 reward: 12
Block 2328480 - 3379679 reward: 6
. . . halving indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)
```

[28-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I quoted the white paper

[28-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks

[28-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> do we know the source of randomness?

[28-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sorry for the delay, I needed to refuel my stomach...
I don‚Äôt remember having it seen in the white paper, but you can always check.

[28-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> So whats going on?

[28-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Seems like none of the exchanges are working

[28-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> DP was down, but it looked this morning that there was activity. Let me check again.

[28-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Apparently it was short lived on DP.

[28-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Stex is active.

[28-Apr-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @kingcolex DigitalPrice has 0 volume on all coins it seem, I¬¥m guessing that they are down for maintanance this weekend.

[28-Apr-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Only some VRSC activity today. I hate it when it's out and there's no word about it...

[28-Apr-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll check their Twitter feed

[28-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nada, niks, nothing, nichts, rien, nincsen

[28-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <domato> Niente

[28-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Well, people can use STEX.

[28-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <domato> good night all !

[28-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Evening.

[28-Apr-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, we can, Crupti. Too bad for the coins I have tied up in DP now...

[28-Apr-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Stex has kyc?

[28-Apr-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> No thanks

[28-Apr-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Anyone want to buy 270 vrsc?

[28-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Stex only has KYC if you want to trade FIAT

[28-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> wtFUD...

[28-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> People that mistake me for him, without any verification, I don't even WANT to trade with

[28-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Now you mention it, no, I'm not

[28-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I hate people abusing my Nick

[28-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Yeah I had PM's with him still, looks like it's not you. Sorry for the bad luck of him using that name

[28-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's OK

[28-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> maybe it's wise not to accuse someone before verifying it's the right person.

[28-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I would appreciate if you removed a couple of lines up there, @kingcolex

[28-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Done

[28-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> thanks @kingcolex

[28-Apr-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Well thoskk I figured since it's a coin that he most likely mines and that's not a common name he might be here trying to  scheme

[28-Apr-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TY very much

[28-Apr-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Oink is here longer than me @kingcolex , and he's one of the most trustworthy persons in this discord I know.

[28-Apr-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Besides that, if I commit a crime it must be worth billions, enough to live the rest of my life in wealth on an üå¥

[28-Apr-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> on a palm tree?

[28-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup... a treehouse with a hammock on a private deserted remote island

[28-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I couldn‚Äôt find an emoticon for that

[28-Apr-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> you'd need two for it to work...  üå¥   üå¥  üòÑ

[28-Apr-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I hate work...

[28-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> You know... I was wondering if oink was oink

[28-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was, am and will always remain Oink

[28-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I should have trademarked the name 30 years ago....

[29-Apr-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bubu> good morning all friends üëè

[29-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> wasn't there an admin of a private torrent tracker called Oink?

[29-Apr-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We should continue any "Oink" related issues in #off-topic , I think

[29-Apr-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> digitalprice working!

[29-Apr-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> On my way!

[29-Apr-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TY!

[29-Apr-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And my (mini) order is placed

[29-Apr-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> mine too

[29-Apr-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Great comment about the FPGA bracket, by the way

[29-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> well, someone will be unpleasantly surprised

[29-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Only reason I can think of, is with a bracket the power connector is unusable...

[29-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I am so happy, that I did not preorder, this poor design is a "no go" for me.

[29-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I did order, but I wish I hadn‚Äôt. Refund no option, cuz they don‚Äôt refund full BTC, just present value.

[29-Apr-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think it's pretty shitty that Verus basically shafted a company and users with a working product to give a lot of free publicity to a company which does not. I hope they don't get the bounty.

[29-Apr-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If they release the bitstream as open source, I don't see how the foundation can deny them the bounty

[29-Apr-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I agree on the free publicity part

[29-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't think Verus shafted the company and users, but the company shafted Verus and its users...

[29-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I realize a deal is a deal

[29-Apr-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, for me it was a risk ordering, just got to deal with it.

[29-Apr-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @Patrick Crypto Which company & users?

[29-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I think shafted is the wrong term for what is implied

[29-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Verus forked to kick out an existing fpga. I thought it was reactionary and seems as though it just resulted in cpu farms taking over

[29-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> It was not the aim to "kick" them out. The goal was to even the hashrate between FPGA / GPU / CPU

[29-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I am probably irrationally annoyed by it all

[29-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Are you saying it wasn't reactionary?
 @Patrick Crypto

[29-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I'm stuck on my ass with a broken foot and annoyed with things I shouldn't even care about. Hopefully price or my staking rebounds soon

[29-Apr-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Gotcha

[29-Apr-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Get better

[29-Apr-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> IMO if Verus hadn‚Äôt forked and put a bounty out, we would be in a worse situation: hidden FPGA‚Äôs in big farms earning bulks of VRSC, mining centralized at said farms and people without the capitol to invest in overpriced expensive FPGA‚Äôs bailing. Now CPU mining is profitable (depending on energy prices) and the hashpower is more decentralized. Affordable FPGA‚Äôs with competitive MH/W ratios can stimulate decentralization.

[29-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Patrick Crypto get well soon

[29-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I don't see the price increasing really for the foreseeable future...

[29-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Not with mining pools that pay out in btc

[29-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @Patrick Crypto I just don't

[29-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm mining at one such pool with my GPUs , but get payed in VRSC...üòÅ

[29-Apr-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Price increase requires new btc

[29-Apr-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
