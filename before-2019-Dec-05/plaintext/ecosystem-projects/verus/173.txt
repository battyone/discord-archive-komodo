[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink We´ll need another CMC exchange to be listed on CMC, just STEX is on CMC of those you mentioned.

[07-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, we do... check #marketing I did fill out some applications last week

[07-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Probably worth considering https://graviex.net too as they are on CMC and got quite a bit of ARRR flows (EDIT: If it hasn't already been entered)

GRAVIEX - GRAVIO Ecosystem Exchange

[07-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They're on my list. IIRC I don't have all the data they require

[07-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> ah

[07-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good call, though

[07-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I would try Crex 24, they seem open to small coins.

[07-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'd agree

[07-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I can´t fill the form myself, probably better with a dev.

[07-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> tradesatoshi __may__ be another option

[07-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but they ask ridiculously high fees for some coins

[07-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats why __may__ be

[07-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Don't call me a dev... You'll insult the dev's by doing so... 😂

[07-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Another good one, I´ve actually been looking at that too, was to be my second choice. I´ve used Satoshi for trading HUSH ,I think, or at least noted it as a potential HUSH trading platform. Think it´s one of the HUSH exchanges with the most volume. EDIT: No, I was wrong , checked it and it is Graviex that has the highest volume for HUSH.

[07-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @MrCryptoCash-AcedPoker.io , already posted in #community-support by @FishyGuts , but thanks for the heads up!

[07-Jun-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I thought the point of paying for the crypto-bridge listing was to have the 2nd CMC listed exchange?

[07-Jun-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Afaik Cryptopia has been payed, but never a listing and now out of business... if we get a listing on another exchange that’s on CoinMarketCap, we can get listed there too, which would hugely increase our visibility

[07-Jun-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Yes, wasn't crypto-bridge supposed to take that place?

[07-Jun-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Stex and CB.

[07-Jun-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have Stex and CB. not many people use them

[07-Jun-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we applied to CMC, and they said to point them to a CMC listed exchange that gets volume. DP volume would be fine, but it's not on CMC listed exchanges

[07-Jun-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Strike that-they are on CMC, just without the "-" 😄

[07-Jun-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Then we just need to increase the VRSC volume on both the STEX and CryptoBridge exchanges

[07-Jun-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Crypto-Bridge did a few days of tweeting without any prompting to take a look at Verus. the trading on CB didn't really pickup from that

[07-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> everyone who uses DP seems to stay there, and that's where reasonable trading is

[07-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Perhaps someone will do some arbitrage trading, VRSC seems cheaper there.

[07-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I do some trades on Stex, but it's pretty annoying. Always some bot jumping 1 sat ahead

[07-Jun-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> AACoin has even been stable for quite some time, turned off their bots in response to the community and has staking, but people still use DP

[07-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> DP has definitely been the best exchange in terms of VRSC trading

[07-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they're not CMC though

[07-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> aacoin market is dead. Been 1 bid for 8 sats for a while now

[07-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yeah

[07-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't think anyone trusts them any longer

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i remember aacoin having deep issues with their staking pool before

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it seems, but they actually didn't do anything themselves that was wrong

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it was when the daemon deprecated and they hadn't upgraded. that was an error

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Their lack of support, lengthy withdrawal times, disabling the wallet, staking problems....

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes

[07-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> TradeOgre should be within reach. (?)

[07-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not as on top of it, but all understandable

[07-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I found numerous typos and dead links on their site. Small things like that add up

[07-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not to say it's ok

[07-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I pointed out gate.io lists for free months and months ago, but I seemed to be ignored

[07-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think the path of least resistance to CMC is DP getting listed eventually

[07-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We haven't heard yet from TradeOgre on the recent app. @FishyGuts said people kept asking them about ARRR and then they finally integrated quickly. I can't provide any details, but there is a seemingly pretty nice exchange coming online soon that will have a collection of very nice projects/cryptos with Verus among them.

[07-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Or do what everyone else does and do some wash trading

[07-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There's really a lot to do, and mostly I focus on development. Getting on all small exchanges can take a lot of time and isn't always the right place to put resources. I don't remember that, but it's never about someone wanting to ignore, I think. Lots of small exchanges, pumps, or even a primary focus on the price as the priority just isn't Verus.

[07-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> gate.io is not a small exchange

[07-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Then either it wasn't seen or we may even have followed up. I don't know.

[07-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It's magnitudes more popular than CB, or STEX

[07-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think someone actually did

[07-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> looking at them now

[07-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but i'm not sure

[07-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> IMO, I don’t want more low volume exchanges. It only raises questions and concerns. Marketing should be focused on by all of us, then exchanges will come by themselves as well as volume due to recognition.

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Gate looks like a good option.

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Everyone was caught up in the CB talk

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not low volume

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @zpajk that is what I have been saying every time this conversation comes up

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Adding more low tier/low volume exchanges will just make it look like a shitcoin

[07-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yet, __if__ a large volume exchange would pick us up then that would drive marketing instead.

[07-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> For that they need to see high volume => fees

[07-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> gate.io is #64/65 rank on CMC

[07-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> But it won't really matter if people don't trade

[07-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> DP would be enough, in the end, all they want is their fees

[07-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> btw, @miketout, I don’t know if you’re the only one using the Verus twitter, but you’re doing a great job if so! 😃

[07-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Which is why I say DP getting on cmc is the most seamless way for VRSC to get on there too

[07-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we should be able to put in an app

[07-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @zpajk not the only one, but sometimes 😃 thanks!

[07-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> With the recent large increase of volume on DP I don't see why they wouldn't be added sooner than later

[07-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick Crypto I agree with that

[07-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @zpajk got my account reactivated yesterday!!! So I'm on it again

[07-Jun-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Unless the increase is just the hacker selling all their stolen KMD

[07-Jun-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it doesn't look like that kind of increase, and I'd imagine they'd want to be further away from the community

[07-Jun-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> ahahah no it definitely is not enough to cover 1m KMD

[07-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Is that how much was stolen?

[07-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It's a bit unclear, but it seemed like that is what DP was saying was missing from their kmd cold storage?

[07-Jun-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> " wallet sent out 423667.07901171"

[07-Jun-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> So the 50k was missing? I thought they were saying that is what was on their ledger

[07-Jun-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> 423k

[07-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> it's in their announcement thread.

[07-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
