[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> Congratulations to everyone in our community, especially our outstanding lead Dev @miketout, it's been truly amazing so far to be a part of something this big, and I can't wait to keep pushing forward with you guys. Really shows how much you can accomplish if you work as a community and pull a few sleepless nights in the process. Cheers! 🎉🎉☺️

[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Hi

[31-Oct-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Must enable slaping?

[31-Oct-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Sapling

[31-Oct-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> get newest wallet

[31-Oct-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> and no, slapping does not have to be enabled, i'll slap people without activation should i feel the need to do so

[31-Oct-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> @Norain you just get the newest release from https://veruscoin.io and have sapling. it was 'activated' (by way of hardfork) a bunch of blocks ago alreadt.

[31-Oct-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Is zs???

[31-Oct-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> wut

[31-Oct-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> to generate a sapling address (if it's that you're asking for) do `komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC z_getnewaddress sapling`

[31-Oct-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @Norain yes sapling addresses start with zs

[31-Oct-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> oh boy the trolls in /r/CryptoCurrency are so stupid

[31-Oct-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> no, they are definitely not stupid. i would call these proper trolls.

[31-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> you're just not falling for the tactics (as i would expect from somebody who does marketing :-P)

[31-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> dont forget, it is a art.

[31-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> that's a positive spin... can we domesticate these trolls and breed them like crypto kitties @0x03 (veruspool.xyz) ?

[31-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> just an idea...

[31-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> trolling is something that should be studied more. not for the hate that is spread, let me be clear on that. i hate hate

[31-Oct-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i dont think theres any argueing with trolls. the only thing i know to stop somebody who is convinced that "X is Y" is to convince him otherweise.

[31-Oct-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> and i dont see how you would do that - especially in filterbubble-land

[31-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> It leaves me a little exasperated when the only thing he has to comment is something pointlessly negative and hostile when he prob has 0% idea of verus whatsoever...

[31-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i would actually assume he _has_ an idea of verus. often times, when you have no meaningful weapons left, you would go unfair.

[31-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> and he - kind of unexpectedly - chose against ad hominem - considering he could've let go much worse that is

[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> hi, im new to the channel

[31-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> hi @verz36 welcome

[31-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> just want to ask about the agama program, i cant get it to work to mine yet. any advice?

[31-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> i download the new one

[31-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> when you first open it up and choose Verus it takes time for the blockchain to be downloaded

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> are you seeing it loading?

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> yes

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> something like this?

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> this will be a  while. you can get my bootstrap to speed it up.

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> then don't worry just give it ahwhile

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> or just wait for it to complete.

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> been there for like 10 minutes

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> it will be 2-4 hours 😄

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> lol

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> ok

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> initial sync is one of the major weaknesses of crypto money

[31-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> now i see

[31-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
