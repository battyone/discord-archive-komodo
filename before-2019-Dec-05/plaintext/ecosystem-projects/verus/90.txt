[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but this is the first time it will come to the masses

[24-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right, and we have no interest in making secret targeting of VerusHash something that is rewarded. open targeting of VerusHash is a completely different story, especially for those who are interested in making an actual decentralized system

[24-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> having hardware that provides great increases in performance doesn't increase centralization

[24-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the secret part i can agree with

[24-Dec-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so people got their rewards for secretly mining. now we can all start over and see how to do things correctly

[24-Dec-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but you can't attribute large incremental increases in technology capabilities with decentralization

[24-Dec-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> variation and availability is what provides decentralization

[24-Dec-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and if it happens again, the secret part, there are lots of knobs and dials on the new algo that any good dev who deals with them this time around will understand. no need to be secret about it. there's even an immediate reward not to be, and if we can work to cooperate together, if there is a future algo change, it can be something we do together. if that can't be, then it can't, but we would like to try.

[24-Dec-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and i get what your saying, i just dont like people using the term decentralization as a metric to push off fpga's like its a monopoly like bitmain etc

[24-Dec-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> your network hash could be comprised of some huge farms of gpu's, that is centralization

[24-Dec-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats the same for any coin

[24-Dec-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> adding any other hardware to the system that is owned by miners everywhere helps to prevent centralization

[24-Dec-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but at the end of the day majority of miners mine what is profitable

[24-Dec-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if you only had miners on your network that truly believed in your coin, you'd have a small centralized network

[24-Dec-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i could have bricked the 325t chip that F1 one uses if that was our decision. it wasn't, and i hope i didn't. our initial hope was to get cooperation on the plan, but without that, I tried hard to make sure they could still implement the algo, though with a significantly smaller gap between CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs than there has been. until someone really does follow the algo, we won't know, but as there is more than one party wanting to, I guess we will see soon enough.

[24-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> ya a lot of unknowns, i'll definitely keep an eye on the space

[24-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its always a slippery slope when you see coins fork a month after finding new hardware on their network

[24-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you're a dev, look at the algo. this wasn't a knee jerk fork. it was very purposeful and the algo was designed for that purpose. we just tend to work quickly

[24-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you guys found out about 2 weeks after the algo was released

[24-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think so

[24-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i started mining it at release

[24-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its only been out about 5-6 week now

[24-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i could find the exact date

[24-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the moment you guys found out about it, everyone in your network had the ability to buy an F!

[24-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> it was no longer secret

[24-Dec-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i started suspecting before that, and by the time it was sure, it was clear that the suspicions were likely accurate when it started. i'm pretty sure i know when it started being used, and it was a bit more than a couple weeks

[24-Dec-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> looks like its been about 7 weeks

[24-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> according to my stats

[24-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so not that long

[24-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you guys found out about a month ago?

[24-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> publicly i should say

[24-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> 4-5 weeks?

[24-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @uchirosan  What's the point you are trying to make, with this conversation?

[24-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm having a conversation with him, not about a point

[24-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> we're just conversing

[24-Dec-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we could not recommend that people buy Blackminer's F1 that was potentially going to be bricked without a deal, and the community wanted this approach. i think it's actually quite reasonable, and i look forward to the first FPGA implementations. very curious how the algo will be solved, which is why we are willing to help FPGA devs. we have no illusions that we will stay immune to custom hardware forever. we just want to get there as a community, not by being sniped from the side.

[24-Dec-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> nobody has to make a point in a convo, you can gain valuable insight into thought processes and clearer understanding

[24-Dec-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No problem. I was just curious.

[24-Dec-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i do understand that @miketout

[24-Dec-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> like i said, i dont agree with secret mining

[24-Dec-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its a double edged sword

[24-Dec-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also understand your point

[24-Dec-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> most coins/devs are incentivized by the current hardware scheme

[24-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> having a piece of hardware that drastically changes the eco system playing field can cause a stir

[24-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and part of the reason why some want to go in secretly

[24-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> not saying its right or wrong

[24-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in fact, given this response, there is a scenario where it turns out only to be positive, but I hope the person behind the secret mining strategy finds another vocation. i don't think this is the way to get millions of people to buy FPGAs, which is the only thing that will allow them to help with decentralization.

[24-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if they had come to you and said, we have a piece of hardware that is 20x greater than what you currently have; what would you have said?

[24-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> most gpu miners that want to fight against fpga's and asics is because theyve invested heavily into gpu's and have suffered the market losses and can't afford new hardware

[24-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so they dont want said new hardware coming into the space

[24-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> we are going to see sub $1k fpga's early in 2019 and $500 fpga's shortly thereafter

[24-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think 20x creates a problem, and i would have wanted to work with them on an algo change to close the gap while not preventing their miner to have an advantage as a professional tool that was specialized enough to economically deserve a premium. in fact, that is exactly what we tried to work out

[24-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> in a market where profits are next to nothing, fpga's can be the saving grace of the mining spher

[24-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not at all

[24-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> what is the current hashrate on your algo on cpu and gpu?

[24-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that argument is exactly the same as saying "there isn't enough to satisfy everyone who wants to participate, so just let a small number of people take more"

[24-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can look in the CPU hashrate channel. people are posting

[24-Dec-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> no,but stalling progress to help those that have hardware at the same of progression is just as bad

[24-Dec-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is no stalling of progress

[24-Dec-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i would disagree with you there, the fact that you feel liek 20x performance on next gen hardware is too much and want to artificially bring it down is stalling progress

[24-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats saying, this new hardware is too fast relative to older hardware

[24-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so we need to bring it down

[24-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but i also see your point of view as well

[24-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't mean to butt in but I just wanted to add that in a system that is so young and where fpgas are not spread out or even known about it's hard to introduce them into a system with such huge electrical efficiencies where there is no small  connection  to price and price can be dropped down when a large Supply is controled

[24-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is good for progress

[24-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> introducing fpga's to the market does nothing to coin prices

[24-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only argument that it is good is an argument that centralization is the cure to not enough mining profits. people are still mining with that advantage now, and if FPGAs follow the fork and cannot be faster than CPUs, it won't be because we wouldn't have cooperated to make that possible. it will be because we were not given that option. if we end up in a spot where FPGAs are definitely slower, we may actually consider a fork at the next natural point to do the opposite.

[24-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's just not going on across the entire Market

[24-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> for those that have mined long enough ,we saw the same arguments from devs when gpu's starting taking the stage:)

[24-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and then again with asics

[24-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> though asics were slanted towards the manufacturers and not what the hardware could do

[24-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we were one of the only coins that made GPU and CPU mining work together on the network. FPGAs took advantage of a weakness in the algo, they didn't introduce some amazing new advance.

[24-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the algo was simply too small

[24-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> they dont typically introduce an amazing advance

[24-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in many ways

[24-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> they just have the power to mine faster and more efficiently without being a door stop like an asic

[24-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> really the best of both worlds in mining

[24-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and i'm a gpu miner for many many years

[24-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and i swapped over to a number of fpga's because it made sense to do so

[24-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> in a time when efficiency can mean no profits or some profits

[24-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the idea that someone can mine more efficiently with more efficient hardware is a fallacy. it's all relative

[24-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if everyone had FPGAs, they would be decentralizing, and they would not provide any advantage

[24-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its not relative, a 1080ti uses a certain amount of power to mine a certain hash at a certain hardware cost

[24-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right

[24-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> a product that can mine more coins, with less power with a better hash/hardware cost is more efficient

[24-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but people will use more FPGAs and more electricity until they reach the amount they will spend

[24-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> no because fpga's cost more as well

[24-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> to compete at the level of their willingness to invest

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if your buidling a $2500 gpu rig

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm talking long term

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> vs a 2500 fpga

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> which one is more efficient for the cost?

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only argument that they are more efficient is a relative argument

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> power usage isn't relative

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its constant

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is a relative question

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> POW makes it constant

[24-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> power usage will go up when everyone has the same hardware to the same willingness to invest

[24-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> majority of people selling their gpu's would disagree with you

[24-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> those same people could buy an fpga and still be mining for the same upfront cost
