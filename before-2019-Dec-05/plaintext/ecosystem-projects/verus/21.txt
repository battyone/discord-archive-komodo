[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> How long would it typically take to mine a block?

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> üòÅ

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I got told myself with 29mh at first, would take me 18 days to find a block, but it only took 4 days.

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I was waiting 15 days after that to find my second block

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> But i upped my hashrate to 61mh after i found the first block

[25-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There is a calculation to work out how long it could take you but i dont know it, its defo on these chats somewhere though, maybe the #faq section

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I have found lots of blocks, started up in May on my own comp;) But her laptop just recently, like two weeks ago. She‚Äôs got like 37mh/s, not a lot! She‚Äôll get a percentage of the reward, when the coins are matured. In a year;)

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> My husband (@Cragorn) started mining the very first day. So we‚Äôre in it for the long haul:)

[25-Jul-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Oh yeh i bet  your always smiling now when you go to your pc üòÅ üëçüèº.

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Nice to hear its a family thing in your house, mining i mean.

[25-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zorgs> I had the same issue trying to work this out

[25-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> There is a basic guide I found on github but it only covers a couple of the options

[25-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zorgs> First parameter download didn‚Äôt seem to work but was ok second time around

[25-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Reading between the lines agama is a miner that can mine multiple coins.

[25-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zorgs> Yeah most of the guides assume some knowledge, I dived in with no idea haha

[25-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Same here , like working in the dark

[25-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sometimes

[25-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> People on this discord helped me out a lot to get me going and im back here everyday now

[25-Jul-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôm stuck in a loop I think üòÇ

[25-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Try closing the wallet give it like 10 secs then reopen the wallet

[25-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Ok, will try that thanks.

[25-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I wonder if there is some way of creating an alert if it finds a block

[25-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Theres more capable people on here than me for stuff like that, sounds good though

[25-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I read about people writing scripts for the cli wallet but i goes over my head to be honest, i would like to get into things like that but im not that clever right now üòÅ

[25-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs working

[25-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Doesn‚Äôt seem to be building the wallet

[25-Jul-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Whats it saying

[25-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im sorry @ChrisC30a  iv got to go do the school run now, ill check back with you when i get back home but you could ask someone in the #gui-wallet section for help or maybe its all ready been solved the problem your having and its just sat there waiting to be read üòéüòÅ

[25-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Hi , glad you got it working

[25-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Looks like you managed to get it to sync with the blockchain

[25-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Mine only took about 5-10 mins first time üëçüèº

[25-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> When its 100% synced up , click the mining box to expand it then choose the number of threads you want to mine with and click start , your hash rate should build up slowly over a few hours till it reaches its max mh/s , its a good idea to keep an eye on your cpu usage , task manager i use , it just gives you a rough idea whats going on because the gui wallet only says mining with your hashrate

[25-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I have a quad core cpu but i only run it on 2 threads, my cpu temperature is pretty high, only got stock coolers on them for now

[25-Jul-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Great thanks.

Will the cpu still be working hard even without any blocks to mine?

[25-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a i dont think your cpu would get used too much while your just syncing up to the block chain but it will use a small amount like any other task on pc‚Äôs

[25-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a  im interested if you managed to get your wallet working , you mentioned that your cpu doesn‚Äôt have the aes instructions set but it does have the avx , a hear a lot of people saying they dont have either instructions set and carnt get it to work, my 2 pc‚Äôs have both aes and avx and iv never had any problems, info on your wallet install could help more people in the future

[25-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Great thanks, that‚Äôs good.

[25-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Sorry, I have 2x 6 core Xeon‚Äôs in my rig. They have aes but don‚Äôt have avx

[25-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Oh right, üëçüèº i got mixed up on that then, same applies though, no avx but if you do have aes it will work

[25-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im seeing mentioned alot  lately that the first time people try and install  agama wallet it seems to fail, but if they keep restarting the wallet and or trying diffrent things it seems to start working

[25-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I can see some people trying to install it the first time and getting stuck on errors and just giving up thinking there cpu is no good for mining verus

[25-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Not everyone knows about discord channels so it must be frustrating when it wont work and theres no one to help you out, i can see a lot of people giving up at that point

[25-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah finally got it working

[25-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> It‚Äôs at 100% no idea what happens next

[25-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yep just click the the box that says mine and it will expand

[25-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Then input the number of threads you want to use and click start mining

[25-Jul-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Also you should create exemptions in your anti virus software incase it try‚Äôs to quarantine files from agama wallet

[25-Jul-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I don‚Äôt have that option, not what I can see

[25-Jul-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Got it...

[25-Jul-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I believe the folders you should add exemptions for are the folder that you use to start the agama wallet, and also 2 folders from inside the %appdata% folder , they are the agama folder and the komodo folder

[25-Jul-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I added all 12 cores to it

[25-Jul-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> How are people regularly backing up the wallet? Syncing it to the cloud?

[25-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yes

[25-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> And also i personaly make a backup folder with both the agama and komodo folders from %appdata% folder and keep it safe, make a new backup every time i find a new block

[25-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That makes sense, play it safe.

[25-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Now I wait for a block üôà

[25-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a I am interested to see what kind of hash rate you get without AVX... can you share when it has been mining for 20-30 minutes?

[25-Jul-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah of course. It‚Äôs saying 0 at the moment. Guess because waiting for a block

[25-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> It‚Äôs saying 2.54 is that good or bad?

I‚Äôm used to see it in h/s

[25-Jul-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Have you got a bit more info on your cpu, model number üëçüèº

[25-Jul-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> KMD up 30% in 24hr, moved up to 72nd position on  cryptocompare.com üòÄ

[25-Jul-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a You are likely losing a huge amount of potential hashing because you are missing the AVX extensions.  I have i7's hashing at 230 mh/s - almost 100 times faster than 2.54.   If you really are getting 2.54 mh/s then the expected rewards would be about .004 blocks per day.   250 days for a block.

[25-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Thats a crying shame that,maybe linux is a better option for him ?
