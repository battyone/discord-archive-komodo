[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> What would that matter anyways? 
Most projects have multiple developers & they fail to have working products, a year into their project. 
We know and we communicate, with Mike Toutonghi.
If he feels it is better for him to handle all things dev team related, he has earned that right.

[08-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> He is open, transparent and readily accessible for discussion on all things Verus related.

[08-Jun-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I came here in August 18.
And I've not once has a issue related to the development team. Mike gets an A+, in
my book, for coordinating all of that and 
doing it successfully.

[08-Jun-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Mining Spec Was there a specific project related question, or issue you had?

[08-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This is an open community and we welcome all questions and comments

[08-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I think the website is great, got all the stuff there that coins normally have ðŸ˜ƒ

[08-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I was just throwing out some ideas about how we could get Verus CMC listed by getting more Verus volume on Stex and Crypto-Bridge ðŸ˜ƒ Listing these two exchanges first on the frontpage _could_ make a small difference, but probably not a whole lot.

[08-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Well, actually I think this is a better strategy

[08-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Most traffic directed to DP

[08-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We have over 1 BTC vol right now

[08-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We need around $10k daily volume there

[08-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Then as for the other 2 exchanges

[08-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We need to help build the order book, if possible

[08-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Getting the word out there that there _are_ other exchanges than DP would help I think, just how to best go about it IÂ´m not sure of.

[08-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> The price difference between them and DP, is too much, and not good.

[08-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Crupti Well we need 1 really solid exchange to show good volume

[08-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Not 3 exchanges, with a small to mid average

[08-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We need $10k daily, from one exchange of 3

[08-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> To show volume

[08-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) If there is a big price difference then people can earn money with arbitrage trading, should fix itself.

[08-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> $10k, if the CMC requirement

[08-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> That hurts our case

[08-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> They will look at all 3..

[08-Jun-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> See, if the two that don't have high volume, do they offer a similar price, to that of the top Verus market on DP

[08-Jun-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> You posted the requirements here

[08-Jun-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If Verus is cheap on one exchange, people would buy it there, transfer it to another exchange, and immidiately sell it for a big profit.

[08-Jun-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would increase volume

[08-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But the volumes on DP are daily 1-3 BTC (including KMD trades) on the other ones as low as a couple of $

[08-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> You mean CryptoBridge and Stex?

[08-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So it's safe to say our volume is not a manipulated one

[08-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> But it is not healthy

[08-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> The prices are off

[08-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> By quite a bit lol

[08-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We have an unverified market on CB

[08-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Because the spread is high due to low volume

[08-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This is what I said.

[08-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I'm saying we need to try to address it.

[08-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> At least when we send in the application to CMC

[08-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's frustrating that DP coin is on CMC, but the exchange isn't

[08-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> API is the issue

[08-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've looked at that before... I don't have all the info and I'm not prepared to fill in other peoples email addresses and names....

[08-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> This coin only had $5k the day it was listed on CMC

[08-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> So here is what I think could be a solution ..

[08-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Instead of being pissed about the vol requirements or whatever other bs it is, stopping us from being listed on CMC

[08-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Could we, as the community, try to pool a fund from community members that have been here since the beginning, and make the order books look better, on those 2 exchanges?

[08-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Because we likely will not be getting a new exchange listing anytime soon.

[08-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We should just address the CMC issue and get it resolved somehow.

[08-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Wash trading? That only creates a misleading market.

[08-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> No no no

[08-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Did I say wash trading?

[08-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I liked when it was possible to buy larger quantities on the onboarding page. Makes buying at a more or less stable price easier there, then more people might buy and send to the exchanges

[08-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Making sure that competetive priced Verus are listed on all 3 exchanges, is not wash trading.

[08-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We are community members trying to ensure that the community has options, and fairly priced ones, too

[08-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Creating more Verus utility would also make the volume go up. PBaaS should help with that.

[08-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> This page I mean, it used the be possible to buy 777 in one go

[08-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Okay. I am speaking about for a short term period of a few weeks

[08-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> While they review the volume etc..

[08-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Not months, or several weeks...
1 to 2 weeks

[08-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> What are some other solutions?

[08-Jun-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I think weÂ´ll just have to make more utility of Verus and market it more. There are ways of getting marketed by YTÂ´bers and other influencers.

[08-Jun-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Who will do those interviews?

[08-Jun-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Dev team is busy

[08-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It doesÂ´nt have to be interviews per say, we could write a press release and put it on PR News Web or one of those PR websites, then also proactively send the news releases to influencers.

[08-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> They are selective in what they mention, for their own reasons.

[08-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Usually monetary ones.

[08-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> ThatÂ´s how companies market themselves, and Verus is kindof like a community company of sorts.

[08-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Really?

[08-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Verus is willing to pay for YTers to put out news?

[08-Jun-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I can promise you this---whatever we want to happen, CMC or to Market, it will require hard work on the communities behalf.

[08-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> There is no simple solution.

[08-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You only pay for the press release listing, but if no magazines etc picks up then you have to send the press release to influensers asf  - not all of them charge money for mentioning stuff.

[08-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> You presented an issue of Volume.
I mentioned a way to address volume.
And the topic changed to focusing on being a utility

[08-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Well, my reasoning is that the more utility a coin has the more people will use the coin, and as a consequence the trade volume will increase - I might be way off, but it just felt as a natural connection to me somehow.

[08-Jun-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I spoke with Pirate & they mentioned a few solutions. 
But they just aren't compatible with us.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Working on a dutch youtuber at the moment...

[08-Jun-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But the more the better

[08-Jun-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> IÂ´m guessing influencers that have reported on Komodo ecosystem and ZCash ecosystem coins before are low hanging fruits.

[08-Jun-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Lol

[08-Jun-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> IÂ´ve marketed products before, and we tried to reach out to reporters that had previous stories with related products. They were more likely to pick up the story as they had some pre-knowledge about the vertical.

[08-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I have a friend w/50k subscribers..
A friend that runs a popular Crypto newsletter & website

[08-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Nice

[08-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It would be marketing gold if we would get an influenser with the right kind of audience to talk about Verus.

[08-Jun-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If you publish a press release you also can get professional mediaÂ´s attention - suddenly you have Mike on Bloomberg Technology talking about PBaaS ðŸ˜„ Or on TechCrunch.

[08-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But, it is very hard to get noticed, even with a well-written press release. If you REALLY want to get noticed by the big tech media weÂ´ll have to pay a professional media company - theyÂ´ll write the story and use their network to get it published in notable media outlets like TV and the big tech magazines online. ThatÂ´s how the big boys (and gals) do it in tech. But it can cost a lot of money.

[08-Jun-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm honestly surprised that hasn't already happened, you know if they really did research and were truly impartial..

[08-Jun-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know if that were my thing I'd be looking for up and coming strong projects with cutting edge tech

[08-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Although, Verus is still a youngin relatively speaking so there's always a hood chance that happens, especially with upcoming main net and a functional test net

[08-Jun-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Godballz It could very much happen that an influencer would just stumble upon Verus, but as a PBaaS first-mover itÂ´s probably smart to also do some active marketing by writing a nice/professional press release text and send it to influencers and relevant news outlets imo.
