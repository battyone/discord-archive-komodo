[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> that is like saying if you can centrally send funds from your address to someone else, that makes the blockchain centralized??

[15-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> centralization means that a single party VALIDATES and others have to trust

[15-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> No, I was just saying centralized, as in you mentioned it earlier...

the rescuing of the exposed wallets was definitely a centralized action. i decided it was better to sweep the funds rather than allow the hacker to

[15-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> in this case 100% of all our sweep transactions are fully validated by all nodes and the blockchain

[15-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> almost all usage of the blockchain is centralized!

[15-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is the validation that is decentralized

[15-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> unless you need consensus from all nodes to do a spend, it is a centralized action, isnt it?

[15-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so people that complain that the funds rescue was bad because it was centralized, fundamentally dont even understand what decentralization is

[15-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> He simply asked what people could see to criticize, in that action?
I simply restated what you wrote, as a possible criticism.

[15-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the fact that many are so called "devs" for other projects, it is just very sad

[15-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> every action in the world is lead by a leader, so it is centralized, and pointing this out as sth bad is stupid, prove if otherwise

[15-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> in this term any crypto is centralized

[15-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i have seen other coin devs say it is bad as it was a centralized action. maybe they didnt understand at all what happened, but in that case why are they making public comments?

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> for example Satoshi is the "center" of BTC üòõ

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> same for any team leader in crypto

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> all is centralized

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if all nodes validate it, it is decentralized

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> centralized sendtoaddress validated by all nodes

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> time to drink the potion and kill yourself, world is centralize, we will die!

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Because they have too much time on their hands

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> People love to criticize. But let them be put in that position

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Let's see how they react.

[15-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> they just felt it is good time to kick komodo when it is struggling with a major hack event

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Screw them

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i will continue to ignore them as i usually do

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I've never cared for KMD haters

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> stupid people criticize, smart - show possible solutions

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I dont like to talk to stupid people

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> They lack creativity

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> They are boring

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> then why you care?

[15-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> anyway, it seems this is in offtopic?

[15-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think that we shouldnt care what say about the recent hack

[15-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Because they have no place to

[15-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> And we worry about us

[15-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I need to order a Verus physical coin

[15-Jun-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Time to get back to trading...
I need 18%-30% today

[15-Jun-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> 18% might be hard to do, but -30% would be pretty easy!

[15-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Lol you'd be surprised

[15-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> But my stack is small lol...
a lot easier that way

[15-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I need to start trading Verus on DP

[dscrdvrsc] <cryptokarma> Is there a Roadmap for Verus?

[18-Jun-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Nope... It changes too fast and that's a good thing!

[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Nice I hadn't seen that

[18-Jun-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> But yeah, they're getting a lot done, and as the paper says - *"we will focus more on correct and complete phases than specific dates
when possible."*

[18-Jun-19 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptokarma> Nice, so we are in middle of phase 2 I guess, any ideas when we will reach phase 3?

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> I forgot to mention the other day @miketout that @10 was the 2nd catalyst for the Graviex listing based on a conversation he and I had 10 days ago.

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Strong communities build strong projects and are just as important as the code itself at this stage in the game.

[18-Jun-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I am always here to help Verus.
I've been a Community Member since August & I've spent a lot of time in here. No more than the most, no less than the least. Anybody that contributes anything to the Verus Community has a voice here, and matters. I don't have a big bag of Verus. I use my crypto to trade & accumulate btc. But this is the only project I've ever given real time to, and I'm glad I've done so.

[18-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Coingecko added Graviex exchange for VRSC and are now tracking that as well. They aren't tracking Zyrex Exchange at the moment, so they could not add that for us at the moment.

[18-Jun-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> I could use a little support.  Foot in the door so to speak.

[dscrdvrsc] <jonnybbig> Does verus agama hold monero? Or any plans to add it?

[18-Jun-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonnybbig> I‚Äôm just tired of having so many wallets

[18-Jun-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I couldn‚Äôt tell you or check... not at PC right now....

[18-Jun-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> couldn't find it in PBaaS test-wallet, so I assume no.

[18-Jun-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 0.5.7-1 has more coins, @Thoskk , so that‚Äôs the place to check.

[18-Jun-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, don't have that on hand right now.

[18-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It stopped raining, I‚Äôll stroll back to my PC...

[18-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I can see it in Exodus wallet, which also contains mostly ERC20 tokens, so maybe there's a chance

[18-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don‚Äôt want to say, just ditch the Monero, which would solve the problem.... üòù

[18-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No Monero in 0.5.7-1

[18-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ‚òù  @jonnybbig

[18-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> maybe Exodus wallet can be an alternative, although it's just a light wallet.

[18-Jun-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonnybbig> hahaha dammit

[18-Jun-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonnybbig> my small bag is in cake wallet on phone

[18-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonnybbig> i may jsut convert it to btc..but i'm uncomfortable keeping none in case ARRR flops and monero moons

[18-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The sensible thing would be to use it to buy verus.

[18-Jun-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not sure if Monero will ever come back strong, their community is more like aristocrats, and their devs ... well, no bashing here.

[18-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Lol, you guys are always bashing my portfolio

[18-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> in that case I would think about portfolio again üòÇ

[18-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Lol, Monero has had  a good run the last 10 days, though, from $80 to $96 - I'm happy üòÑ

[18-Jun-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> most high-cap coins had that üòâ

[18-Jun-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> All these new Binance and Bitmex US regulations & bans make the privacy coins pump

[18-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Pirate is gaining also!

[18-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sure, but also BNB, LTC, BTG ... and many more. Many of the high cap coins gained quite a bit

[18-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Bitcoin Private went up %458 today üòÑ

[18-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but why did Verus dip then?

[18-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Volume?

[18-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> DP is +4% volume about 1 BTC

[18-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus was high on the profitability list of fpgas. They all auto exchange so that pushes the price down

[18-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> ZEXO up 35% on DP , they have some more volume on their exchange but small peanuts yet

[18-Jun-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> UKMiner released?

[18-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
