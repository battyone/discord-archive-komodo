[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me check the official list

[17-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You are right, no bittrex... it should be on aacoin though

[17-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> me neither ... 🤔

[17-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This info is on the Veruscoin.io website, by the way

[18-Apr-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> LOL

[18-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I agree, We're starting to get noticed

[18-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Cool.

[18-Apr-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And I just hit **like** on that tweet, just to see how much further it'll go.

[18-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> look

[18-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i dont mean to sound ungrateful, even though I am. A "tip" of 1 cent is hardly amusing, and irregardless I will buy more VRSC. **What I am saying** is that tipping new community members such minuscule sums is not good. Better to not tip at all. While the price rests at $0.10 per coin it is (IMHO) abhorrent that anybody should tip  amounts less than that, particularly when coupled with risible comments. This community is about to explode, and if the incumbents cant appreciate the interests of new members over the value of 1 penny, then the the cypherpunk roots of this coin are *truly* compromised.

[18-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> It shouldn't be only miners who are rewarded for engagement. This is why bounties exist. It behoves this community to "share the wealth" in a manner more beffitng its crypto-anarcho "God Dammit, Lets change the World" manifesto

[18-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> /rant over

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm raining everyday to encourage members to come back and stay

[18-Apr-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Actually 5% of my private pool goes to my discord address

[18-Apr-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And we have the bounties you talk about... Have a look at #active-bounties

[18-Apr-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I can say from my own experience that community members that are actively involved in the community will not be overlooked

[18-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I personally am not a huge fan of the tip thing myself, but I can understand its value. I will say that even finding .01 vrsc tip with my name highlighted, means something to me more for the thought than the actual coin. Not to mention that .01 could be worth quite a bit some day. I probably would never cash out my discord name anyway, always considered it a pay it forward, fun sorta thing.

[18-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's just one perspective though. I'm just grateful to be here, along for the ride!

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Godballz TY

[18-Apr-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @gigamesh Just to clarify, you understand you’ve been tipped by a community member and not by the team for your efforts? I fail to see if you’re discouraged by tipping service or if you’re actually wanting to be compensated by the team through a bounty instead. As said before by someone else; there are active bounties already listed, and if not the team might value efforts enough to reward either way, but that doesn’t have anything to do with tip or rain functions by the tip bot.

[18-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @zpajk ofc i was not seeking team compensation. in fact i was oblivious to the bounties (I will now check them). what i did object to (perhaps wrongfully) was the dispensation of such ridiculously small tips (e.g. 0.05 VRSC), that any benevolence intended  would patently be lost in transaction (Lost in Translation, lol)

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> good timing, just logged in 😄

[18-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> thanks @gigamesh

[18-Apr-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @gigamesh You'll regret that if VRSC ever reaches BTC prices 😄

[18-Apr-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Like that guy that bought two pizzas using $30 worth of BTC 9 yrs ago - today that's $53 million 😄

[18-Apr-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Haha don’t dwell in the past. Hell if I look back at all my btc transactions from 2010 -______-

[18-Apr-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well, i bet a lot of people sold their 0.X btc back when the prices first went into idiotic territories only to discover a bunch of weeks after that they should've waited

[18-Apr-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> wasn't it fun, though? ^^

[18-Apr-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ....like me 🤣

[18-Apr-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> shouldnt gigamesh be named gilgamesh?

[18-Apr-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 🤔

[18-Apr-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm still looking for that USB stick from the early days, which came together with a bank account and 10 BTC on it ... 😖

[18-Apr-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i just FOMO'd back in... bought my 50 cents back

[18-Apr-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok, when Thoskk ever finds back his usb stick he'll owe us a large and fat kobe steak

[18-Apr-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> payable to gigamesh and me

[18-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i remember selling .25 btc for like 250EUR or something

[18-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and weeks after it would've been almost 2k 😄

[18-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ere we go...

[18-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> however these 250 bucks were spent awesomely, in a holiday by the sea

[18-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if I ever find it, I will  buy VRSC for at least 30% of it, and soak one third over all of you 🤣

[18-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
