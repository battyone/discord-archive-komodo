[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Not a big deal for us , worth the extra security in my books

[05-Dec-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> Hope the new algorithm is cpu solo mining:smiley_abused:

[05-Dec-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @SadykovT yes, but still slower than the other miners. I will try to change that in the next update, but it all depends on what we can do on the algo today üòÉ

[05-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> hey can i send from private address to public?

[05-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> @rptr  yes

[05-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> thanks

[05-Dec-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Personally, I have a very big optimism about Verus. I see a lot of potential and I see how Mike is close to the community.

[05-Dec-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Verus is only at the very beginning of its formation, it is still a very young project. As soon as the broad mass of people learn about Verus and it will be listed on large exchanges ... Those who have not sold their coins and have been a consistent holder of coins Verus will receive a very good reward for believing in the project and patience

[05-Dec-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> In every discord of every coin there is a dude like Takoy. "Hold and you will be rewarded", but like the enthusiasm

[05-Dec-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> I am not one of those dudes who is in every discord. In my opinion there are several projects that have great potential, Verus is one of them. This is not enthusiasm or blind faith.

[05-Dec-18 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I‚Äôm the one in every discord

[05-Dec-18 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> And Verus is still the one

[05-Dec-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> AkiraX knows a lot about good projects)

[05-Dec-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I said "like you". Every community of a coin wants it to succeed or pump or whatever

[05-Dec-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> There is nothing reprehensible in this; everyone wants to make money. BUT I do not see the Verus project as an investment that I will sell at the first pump, I will still leave part of the deposit and, with a new round of the market, will again increase the Verus coins. In short, I like the project and I will be there for a long time.

[05-Dec-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah it will increase in value, like every other coin üëåüèª

[05-Dec-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Well, if so, why did you choose Verus?

[05-Dec-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well out of all the other projects it seemed it would pump the most

[05-Dec-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> If Verus did not meet your expectations of a big pump, does this project become the same as others?

[05-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> To be honest, yes. But other mentality, other preferences, etc.

[05-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Maybe someday if we can actually do something with the coins rather than mining and trading and speculation (in general) im gonna think differently. But for now, mostly every coin has a wallet, algo and promises this and that

[05-Dec-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Hash no joke 43th

[05-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @Yii Many projects promise, but few really do and really communicate with the community, listen to the opinion of the community.

[05-Dec-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Pools getting DDOS'd... 
I guess when people don't get their way, they attack you in every way

[05-Dec-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Emmanuel  Hahaha... VerusTV

[06-Dec-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> 28 TH/s . CPU dead with these FPGAs on the network, Hope a decision is made soon

[06-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Skillachie You use CPU?

[06-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> Is 2 months for listing on Cryptopia normal? seems like i little bit of a rip off to demand payment and than they can add you whenever they like ü§î

[06-Dec-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I heard that sort of experience in too many discords.  üò¶  CT loves to do that.

[06-Dec-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Cryptopia drags their feet, at everything...
Earlier this year, I had 4 or 5 NEO, then $40+ that I sent from Binance to Cryptopia. After I sent it, CT took down their NEO wallet due to maintenance. Long story short, I didn't see those coins, for 5+ weeks... It took Binance & other exchanges, only a few hours to fix their NEO wallet, bc of network issue...
But I think Verus will do well, on their platform...
They have good trading volume

[06-Dec-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> The only thing i hear from coins which lists on cryptopia, is that their wallet is mainly in maintenance for weeks üòÑ

[06-Dec-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I find it very amusing, that someone here arguing so vehemently about FPGA being let on the network, was in their Discord praising them---for their hardware's performance... Hypocricy lol

[06-Dec-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> Has anyone done the math on how much attacking power would have to be mounted to 51% VRSC's PoS/PoW hybrid? It would be a cool factoid to know. üôÉ

[06-Dec-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Fpgas are good at securing the network and they are good for the environment. I want to own an fpga. But i think they are bad for the continual growth of the vrsc community and bad because all the hash could soon be controlled by one companies bitstream. This also creates a very unstable hash rate. The white paper also states fair distribution as one of its key goals. So, at this stage of the project I think they should be banned and the currency forked. They are potentially stopping hundreds of thousands of casual miners and vrsc uses, to give close to 100% of pow coins to a few thousand fpga miner if they don't stop it.

[06-Dec-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz above, no hypocrisy, I have given the same view on both discord channels

[06-Dec-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman  Man, come on...
In one sentence, you said don't negotiate with terrorists.. And then the next, you're saying that you will eventually be using an FPGA and possibly bringing Verus price down...
You can't jump from one side to the other, comment after comment...

[06-Dec-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Lumbi @Gloryman He says these negative things about FPGAs. But he has openly stated that he wants to buy one, to mine Verus with...

[06-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Don't negotiate with terrorists was a joke. But the point I was true. I believe at this point is should be forked. Also, people on the other discord channel were voicing concerns of coin raping being bad for both communities. I have always been upfront about buying an FPGA to mine with. Ask Chris and Strecher83. We have been talking about it for months. When has my opinion ever been different from any of the discords

[06-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Its always remained the same.

[06-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz above

[06-Dec-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, I will mine VRSC with an FPGA if its not forked.

[06-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Then why not take a position, and keep it..
It seems like you are on both sides of the fence, so to say...

[06-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It will damage the coin, imo, but it will create huge short term profit. It wouldnt be my fault if developer didnt want to fork it.

[06-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have a position and I have always kept it

[06-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You're standing in the middle, with one foot on each side

[06-Dec-18 01:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
the exact same argument has been and will be made after every advance in mining tech. fpga's were on the scene before asics many years ago.  It could be possible that asics will be created in the future to usurp the current fpga's or even the code to obsolete them. This is a microcosm of the march of progress in semiconductor design. there is no easy answer. but embracing and utilizing progress has more often than not been conducive to survival.

[06-Dec-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> Just used verus sapling shielded address to sapling shielded address....not instanious....took a sec....but fast and cool....üòç

[06-Dec-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> No bro. I will state it as simply as I can. VRSC coin should fork as i believe to be the best for the project but if they dont I will want to mine with an FPGA.

[06-Dec-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Just support the project & do, as you please... 
You seemed to put a lot of opinion out there, on this...

[06-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I got the feeling you were against FPGA...
Then I read before and after, then saw you on another discord... And I couldn't really tell what you though, except that you thought a lot

[06-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Let me put it another way. Lets say I believe that fuel prices should be taxed to raise money for something else, military for example. If they dont tax the fuel, that doesnt mean I wont take advantage of the low fuel prices. Can you see what I mean?

[06-Dec-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz Sorry. I will try to be clearer in future. People that know me on this discord know I am for FPGAs but not on this coin so early

[06-Dec-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> or at least without some reducing of performance, but mainly forking

[06-Dec-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Just a quick piece of honest advice...
Write in plain English...
You are saying, FPGA might or might not be taxed on Verus mining.. Either way, you want to reap the benefits, from FPGA mining...

[06-Dec-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And that's fair

[06-Dec-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It was an analogy to do with wanting a rule or law to be in place but taking advantage of the law if it comes into effect.

[06-Dec-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> FPGAs are never going to be fair, imo.

[06-Dec-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So, to sum this up---you like the Verus project...
But you also enjoy financial gain, wherever that might be.. Is that right?

[06-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I like Verus project sure and yes, I am a miner that wants value.

[06-Dec-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The issue is not simply for or against FPGAs. There are things such as timing, pacing, competitiveness, ect...

[06-Dec-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> In my opinion, there hasn't been an honest & clear discussion, about FPGAs. And what Verus is going to be giving up, in order to get -- from this company...

[06-Dec-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz agreed. That's why I tried starting the conversation buddy..

[06-Dec-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I do trust Mike wholeheartedly though..

[06-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He has put in more work, than anyone, on this project

[06-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I don't blindly trust anyone.

[06-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> but mike is very helpful and communicative

[06-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I believe that it is in his interest, to do what is best for Verus...

[06-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And, from his experience, it shows that he does have a skillet needed to do this

[06-Dec-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He has real world experience in an executive role, at some of the top tech companies in the world

[06-Dec-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Well I go on my on decisions and opinions but people should do what they believe to be right

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> People in executive tech roles fail all the time.

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Take Hawaei

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Right is right and wrong is wrong..
But I trust a guy, with that type of experience, probably over any crypto dev out ther

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
It is looking like fpga mining will eclipse most asics very soon because of adaptability and efficiency. just because you fork verus to thwart current fpga's doesn't  mean the threat is gone

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Fail? Dude...

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Steve Balmer

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You obviously havent looked up his experience

[06-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That's obvious

[06-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have he developed java and was the vice president at Microsoft.

[06-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Very important operations

[06-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And?

[06-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> and what?

[06-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CTO of Parallels ...

[06-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Steve Balmer was the CEO of mircosoft

[06-Dec-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> voted the worst CEO ever, lol

[06-Dec-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Do you even know what he did at Microsoft?
The guy was a tech fellow

[06-Dec-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> of worst of the year

[06-Dec-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You have no idea what you are talking about, period

[06-Dec-18 01:17 PM] actionslacks#4072
how much time do you want the project tp spend worried about keeping fpga's away?

[06-Dec-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah he was in charge of the java project

[06-Dec-18 01:17 PM] actionslacks#4072
because they are not going away

[06-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah and creating the .Net platform....cough cough...
That's all

[06-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No big deal

[06-Dec-18 01:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
balmer curve

[06-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm not sure where this conversation is going. He has an impressive CV. I;m not arguing with that.

[06-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He's not Steve Balmer... lol
Seriously, do your research first man

[06-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So he probably has the ability to come up with the best plan possible

[06-Dec-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> OK mike is god. Lets all give him everything we own, you win.

[06-Dec-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And alternatives...
But i think it should be a public discussion

[06-Dec-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> bye bro. i gtg
