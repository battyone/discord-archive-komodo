[dscrdvrsc] <admon> All other things that you say are band aids. ðŸ˜‚

[04-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> fork sounds like a cat and mouse game , i think

[04-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I'm disappointed

[04-Dec-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> why disappointed? math is math, reality is reality, it's not easy

[04-Dec-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Because im from the begining in the project an the philosophy it's changing

[04-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon there is no way to make any algorithm that won't eventually get hardware. we say that in our vision paper. we have not had hardware until now, and we have two options, spend a lot of our best development energy on an unending arms race until ASICs eventually win if we have enough development resources left to do the most valuable thing we can, which is the vision, or figure out a way to smoothly transition to hardware with an open source option that is equally accessible to all and do our best to make CPUs and GPUs continue to be a viable option. We are most concerned about the long term success of the project, and the real purpose of the hash algorithm, 50/50 model is maximum decentralization. If we can achieve that AND have FPGA support, we are basically protected from an arms race until ASICs, which would require significant market cap to justify the investment.

[04-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @Emmanuel  because if they use a more power before the project accomplish who will made validate, I know there are 50-50 but you will lose power in the net to fast in the next year's.

[04-Dec-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I only remember that the project will be asic resistant, so what happend?

[04-Dec-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well it is asic resistant as of now ðŸ˜…

[04-Dec-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I know that you have a hard work to do, maybe you are tired, let's time to think and evaluate it.

[04-Dec-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Yes but not for fgpa

[04-Dec-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> our original goal was to use maximum CPU advantage to have a chance of resisting GPUs when they come. we did, and with @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops joining the community as an incredibly helpful GPU dev who also helped on the CPU side, I'd say we achieved it. at the same time, we did not have a hardware design, and now that we do, we see there are some things we may be able to modify to help equalize FPGA, CPU, and GPU as well. If we can get cooperation from FPGA providers, the most serious miners can invest and make professional returns while still making it reasonable to continue mining on CPUs and GPUs. Most importantly for the long term success is decentralization and continued progress towards the vision, which is what we are working on and would like to stay focused on vs. a hardware arms race. Please look at our vision paper and white paper, we always talked about a holistic approach to ASICs, that includes the hash algo being CPU optimized and 50% POS to prevent the security issues. People kept saying that meant ASIC resistant, but we never claimed it was truly resistant, and we always said in interviews there is no such thing as a truly resistant algo. There really isn't. Our goal now is more equalization.

[04-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we do not expect to make FPGA purely equal to CPU and GPU, but we know we can close the gap to some degree. We could also knock them out right now, but if we do, the next hardware will come along, and we will be in the same position with someone else. The hardware that would then be required will also cost a lot more.

[04-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> The goal is descentralization,

[04-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> There will be always better versions, so much resources wasted just to fork them off, ar best, make a algo change so they wont be that much better, so cpu/gpu/fpga, everyone can have something from the pie

[04-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right, so if we fight hardware until only the most expensive hardware finally beats us, we will be most centralized by the very few who could afford it

[04-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> How do you propose closing the gap between the performance of one 2500 FPGA and that of a GPU/CPU?

[04-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yii we will not waste a great deal of resources if we can fork to bring them closer. this is like Aikido or Chin Na, but if we try to stop them, we will fight until someone beats us

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> 60GH+ crushes everything

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah cool, do the first thing

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Yo have a Titanic work.to do

[04-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Sorry for my response but I'm ðŸ˜¡

[04-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop i'm not going to disclose that yet, but it would be pretty trivial to knock them out, which i'd prefer not to do rather than close the gap. if we can enable them to serve the community with less expensive devices, especially if we can keep CPU and GPU relevant, that will be maximum decentralization, IMO

[04-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Sure, it's trivial with a fork

[04-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon I don't think it's titanic, but we think a lasting solution is better than a war with many battles

[04-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Just trying to figure how in the world you can close a 60GH gap when the best CPUs and GPUS are doing 1.6-1.8GH

[04-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop i mean brick those machines for VerusHash without the option of bitstream upgrade

[04-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> you would basically need to see these FPGAs go to 10GH or less than what they are currently doing. Not sure how that is work out with them selling for 2500/unit

[04-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not going to disclose my technical plan on that now, but if we do agree to work with FPGAs at this time, we will want to have a plan that makes sense to call for peace now. there is some work to still do, and we are working on that.

[04-Dec-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Thise companies don't care talk and reduce hashrate

[04-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> no one is going to reduce their hashrate, it's naive to think that

[04-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> That's right

[04-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> they have a multipurpose unit selling for X dollars

[04-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Is the sale engage

[04-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's not a question of choice. there will be a fork. it's a question of if the fork will support FPGAs but with them being slower, or if it will block them and postpone for a bigger battle later

[04-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Bitmain is a clear example.

[04-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Well my opinion is that they don't care

[04-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> They sell many miners

[04-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> They accomplish his sales

[04-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Next

[04-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> The math doesn't really work for them to run slower. I see that as a non-starter

[04-Dec-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm not salty over this either, it's the nature of the beast for this to happen. As a miner from early June, it sucked having to turn things off last month

[04-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You are assuming things @admon ðŸ˜…. Not every chines company is like bitmain

[04-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚

[04-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Really????

[04-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's not a question of math. it's not a question of their choice in slowing things down. if they choose not to follow the fork, we won't have FPGAs, so that won't be the end of the world either. it's question of whether we decide to fork to slow them and cooperate with them to help the community of serious miners or if we block them and commit to doing more work multiple times in the future

[04-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Plus plus plus plus

[04-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well yeah

[04-Dec-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Unfortunately, fpga on the Network allows them to scoop up coins for next to nothing while we have to deal with electricity cost and wear and tear on expensive parts. This allows them to dump at extremely low prices, manipulating the price and lowering the value of verus for us all

[04-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> And not only this they have rent plan of cloud mining

[04-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> no one should be CPU/GPU mining anymore with the hashrate where it is, unless they have free electric and even so, you are better off mining other things

[04-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So in the meantime while we figure this out they are essentially lowering the value of all of our wallets..

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Thats why the coin is stable since 1 month, i see, they dumped it down ðŸ˜‚

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> you guys seem pretty focused on the f1 lol

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout it is a question of math... no manufacturer is going to sell their multipurpose units for substantially less than the prevailing rate when one of the algos decides to slow down

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i am, and I don't have free electricity, both on CPU and GPU. if someone wants to help the network, believes in what we're doing, or just keeps their computer on, they can make their choice.

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You are assuming things and you dont even know the company or their hosting plan

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not sure of your point @bishop maybe i really don't understand what you're trying to say

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm supporting the network by staking but I refuse to be a loss leader

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yii are you referring to me?

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> No, you are the only rational one here

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thank you ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Yeah me

[04-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout they are selling at 2500 a unit and do 60-65GH (from what I have read), how do you see them (without getting too technical) working with Verus

[04-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @Yii they have a rental plans

[04-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Its not a rental plan

[04-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I will continue to mine don't get me wrong, I believe that this project is still undervalued but fpga introduce a lopsided  element to a large part of the way this coin rewards

[04-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I see in website

[04-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @Yii A rationale person doesn't mine at a loss. They mine something better and then exchange

[04-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Maybe they have only for some special users

[04-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You purchase and can host it over there in the datacenter or get i shipped

[04-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> hosting isnt renting

[04-Dec-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> because if they don't, everyone who bought one will need to mine something else. if they do, we have a plan to get them to offer a less expensive version, and with an attenuating algo change, FPGAs will still be a more professional choice. They would also know that they don't get forked away from because they cooperate, and the community knows they can buy a machine and we will work with the manufacturer if we fork.

[04-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> and i would support a project with that mentality @miketout

[04-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> how do you offer a less expensive version of a multialgo product? They would be cannibalizing their own product line

[04-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> ASIC, fine, but something that can change due to a revised bitstream, I'm not seeing it

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Actually for an fpga 2500 bucks is quite cheap ðŸ˜‚

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @bishop let's do more time to fix this

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Try to buy a bcu or cvp

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @bishop you and me know the only way is blocking the miners.

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> ðŸ˜‚

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> You do realize one of the selling points of Verus, was the CPU and GPU even playing field argument, right? Highly efficient CPUs in the beginning, then GPUs and CPUs within reach of each other. I see no scenario where a gap can be closed with FPGAs

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The things is, you may knock this company of with their bitstream, as more developer come online every day with their cards and bitstreams, you will have to fight on 10 fronts at some point

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> fpgas are coming ranging from 500$- 10000$ in 2019 you will be able to able to buy a 500$ usb fpga that has the same BEP of an F1. Coin devs will have to make a decision fork to memory intensive algos that FPGAS cant currently mine or embrace the new tech and move on. Many Bitstream devs would work with coins to make sure all parties are happy.

[04-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> MBC is a perfect example of a coin embracing the tech

[04-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> Zen Protocol

[04-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> so if we rule out closing the gap, then a multialgo approach is the next option

[04-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Build the algo around the machine, not a machine around an algo ðŸ˜¬

[04-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yii is correct. they have a low priced FPGA option, and what we do by blocking them is just raise the price bar to the next company offering something less people can buy. if we can get them to offer lower priced, equivalent ROI options to the community, and especially get the CPU and GPU's to still be relevant, I think that is ideal. We would also have no more concern of hardware until we are really a reasonable target for full blown ASICs.

[04-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I see no reasonable timeline to be able to convince a manufacturer to lower their prices, especially when their F1 is but a few months old last I checked

[04-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @miketout sorry for this comments, you can will do that you can do, but for the moment it's no profitable mining verus, sorry.

[04-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> F1s are not the only manufacturer

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well, they wont lower the price tag, that would be something new ðŸ˜…

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @Honey I get that, but that's the one that is publicly available

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well the other current fpgas suck balls right now

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> ....lots are publicly availiable

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> bitstreams publicly available for Verus?

[04-Dec-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon understood. i will continue to mine, as i have confidence over time, but i fully understand. As far as pricing, think of simply serving different market segments with different product SKUs, usually a good move for a company.

[04-Dec-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You need the machine first, the bitstream wont get you far alone

[04-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> In the meantime wouldn't this to a degree effectively gimp the pow side in a decentralized sense at the very least?
