[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> This is an open protocol, I think it is always company's responsibility. They should decide whether using vrsc is better than alternatives or not and act according to the risk and rewards. Protocol and developers should not be responsible similar to  how tcpip devs are not responsible when someone gets hacked

[17-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> "the data deletion, also against EU GDPR" . This is a massive issue for all blockchains as well. I dont think its anywhere near solved  in any blockchain.

[17-Nov-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> "data  breach" ? stolen coins are a data breach; a  bug in the code can result in a data breach etc etc. 

 @idrtis that's an interesting PoV but tcpip has no financial values, why blockchain as a protocol should have? If you provide a service you are accountable for it and you are also paid for it. Take as example the sim swap attack in the US: if you provide me a service, it's your responsibility protect my data or...you'll be sued.

[17-Nov-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> I would agree with you if this was zcash or any other coin with dev fee in it, then they would be responsible. Mike and the team dont get paid if they improve the code, patch bugs, add new features. It doesnt matter whether they have any investment in it, maybe they have maybe they dont. It might be better if we can answer these questions in a bigger environment, BTC. What would you say if it were BTC?

[17-Nov-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> BTC? From a business point of view, completely useless. It was and still is a wonderful revolution/idea but can not be used in any business environment. Verus's aaS, same approach as Google cloud/Azure/etcc... is, imho, the only way to generate revenues and to create a "product".

[17-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Diabolik @John Westbrook @idrtis these are good questions, and i think there are good answers. i may not understand all the discussion yet, but here is my distilled take as a starting point:
1. John explained the use of PBaaS correctly, as well as custom CCs.
2. If someone creates a chain, the consensus models will provide some options, for example, privately (corporate keys) validated, PoS validated (likely 100% with Verus chain used as clock oracle, as per the Proof of Power reference in description of PoS), publicly validated by some other algorithm.
3. At least most chains would support z-transactions, certainly the first we expect to support in PBaaS
4. Every PBaaS chain is actually an independent block chain that can be deleted as part of an application use lifecycle. Of course, once public, no one can prevent the data from being retained somewhere, but if all critical data that should be deleted is encrypted, either explicitly, or as memos in a z-transaction, that should provide necessary foundation for best practice data security and privacy as well

[17-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> It could be less useful in your point of view, but what I am asking is if an open source blockchain protocol such as BTC is used for business and there is a problem with either GDPR or data deletion right to be forgetton, how would you solve these questions?

[17-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> @miketout,  I think @Diabolik is probably a lawyer and mostly asking for potential problems when PBaaS is used by corporations

[17-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> If I understood correctly

[17-Nov-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @idrtis nope! I work in IT Operation in a large multinational enterprise.

[17-Nov-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> Noo ðŸ˜®

[17-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Quick side note, when data is created...to act responsibly...youâ€™ve got to assume it will live forever.

[17-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I realize we are also discussing legalities of deleting data, but just saying ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as far as who is responsible. there are plenty of disclaimers to help people understand, this is an open source project with a community of ostensibly, the world. we are people of many different disciplines building software and protocols that people can evaluate and use, either in the public, experimental system that is Verus Coin and running as a public service, whether we are here or not, or a corporation could even make their own implementation and use the open source, though it won't be the same system at that point and will no longer have the world as its community

[17-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in this sense, it is exactly like BTC

[17-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are not responsible for a company's use of the software or network

[17-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just want to be clear on that, in case it was a little vague ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm kind of joking because it shouldn't be vague in the legal licensing, disclaimers, etc.

[17-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you use the BTC network for something and have a problem, who is responsible?

[17-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @miketout I see a succesful blockchain as  a Redhat, opensource core and enterprise support plus useful (and paid) features. Am I wrong? Isn't it a way to generate revenues?

[17-Nov-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the difference is that someone needs to run infrastructure with the Redhat model. decentralization is the real advance. we write software, and it lives in the people

[17-Nov-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Public blockchains as a service don't require a company to keep them running properly if the protocol works

[17-Nov-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they don't require a company to provision them

[17-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> run them

[17-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> do anything at all

[17-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if the protocol is correct, the system lives as long as it is useful, independent of developers

[17-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> There could an open source VRSC protocol, and a separate for-profit company that could help companies create software on top of vrsc

[17-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or many

[17-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> this is the open source protocol, and people are making it live

[17-Nov-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as we enable PBaaS, that creates a whole new capability that will be part of a public, auditable, open source protocol that lives in Verus Coin. companies can build on that with custom PBaaS chains and applications to their hearts' content. They don't have to worry about the same security issues as BTC, because we have advanced consensus protocols and will secure independent chains as appropriate for the application with notarization back into Verus->Komodo->BTC

[17-Nov-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> of course, some companies or governments may want their own implementations, so that is their option, but the public availability of the system to everyone is important to the vision

[17-Nov-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> you wrote "if you use the BTC network for something and have a problem, who is responsible?" a potential answer can be: which corporate uses btc? Keep in mind that I really love your approach and the fact that Verus is light years above some coins. I'm just looking for a constructive discussion on enterprise adoption

[17-Nov-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i agree that for enterprise adoption, the corporate model, whether it really works or not, is to have someone to sue, so they can feel there is "stake" behind all their bets. the way I see it, we should work to make it so that they can be responsible for their PBaaS code bases for example, and when they create a PBaaS chain of a certain class, mining, staking, and node providers for that service, which could also be limited to specific entities, would still use the Verus Network for that provisioning marketplace and protocols

[17-Nov-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> also enabling cross-PBaaS chain integration over time

[17-Nov-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is actually not the primary scenario, but i can see that ability being valuable for general use of Verus

[17-Nov-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Thank you, constructive discussion. Would be nice to see Verus mainstreamðŸ˜‰  I think, but may be completly wrong , that a business approach (use cases, services on top of open source core, maintenance plans, sla agreements, etc) is the only viable way to a mainstream adoption

[17-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I certainly think those things can eventually be provided by companies using the protocol and the public network

[17-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also appreciate these kinds of deeper discussions ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Nov-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> I'm  not sure I can help Verus right now, but let me know (who needs the good old ppt deck? ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ )

[17-Nov-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> For others interested in business blockchain, have a look @ Gartner analysis (some are public available). They are often the "shill masters" ðŸ˜¬  but concepts are valid and interesting

[18-Nov-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Diabolik appreciate it. i've worked a lot with Gartner and some of their analysts in my past roles. I do try to keep up on what people are thinking/measuring. welcome to the community, and I look forward to more discussion

[18-Nov-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Bo> Hi, how much are the staking rewards for VRSC? I searched, but didn't find the answer

[18-Nov-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Bo just as mining reward 24 VRSC

[18-Nov-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Bo> per..

[18-Nov-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Per won block

[18-Nov-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Bo> Okay, so you win blocks by staking? Or should I mine too?

[18-Nov-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Mining is best done in a pool, depends on what hw you have available, you can try and check it out. For staking you need to buy VRSC, maybe 8500 to 12000 to win one block a day. Check out the Verus POS calculator XLS

[19-Nov-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i heard it may have needed a resync earlier. The explorer has its own local database of the chain, and it seems to get out of sync periodically. @englal usually reindexes it, but based on its behavior, we may want to schedule a reindex more regularly. @englal please help out if you see this. thanks @jbates58 !

[dscrdvrsc] <Cryptoon> Is this something that might be interesting for verus?

[19-Nov-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @jbates58 I think it just takes so super long that it's not something we'd want to see done daily, we'd never get to use the explorer ðŸ˜ƒ ... well not that bad I guess, but I think the reindex was started around 2 AM EST and it's getting close to finished...so roughly 7 or 8 hours looks like at this point?

[19-Nov-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Maybe it could be done every couple weeks and a red bar across the top to indicate it's reindexing, with a little explainer faq

[19-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @John Westbrook that every 2 odd weeks would be sick. especially with a status bar ðŸ˜ƒ

[19-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm going to look at the source code, pretty sure I can get the status bar coded in and maybe in a way that doesn't need to be "ticked" on or off by englal, if it can auto detect the status of the page

[19-Nov-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> And looks like the explorer is all reindexed and happy now! ðŸ˜ƒ Thanks @englal

It's a little bit  "high level" but, imho, there are a lot of concepts too often missed in the crypto space

[19-Nov-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @John Westbrook no but I work for a very similar consulting firm

[19-Nov-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> There are some quite good reports about business PoV but, even if they are public, you will not find them on reddit. Another example https://www.logistics.dhl/blockchain

What I hope, here, is to share opinions with a little different approach than "to the mooon" ðŸ˜‰

[19-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> so maybe IÂ´m a little bit biased but what makes vrsc so different and better? or from a company view, why should I use vrsc?

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @DÍžÍ¥UÍžÍ¦DÍžÍ­EÍžÍ£ Why would you not use pbaas? It has so much better value than permissioned blockchains while - if we have wide recognition of the latest paper - providing more security at lower cost. The question is why would you use other solution than VRSC for developing?

[19-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Not sure what you mean by "from a company view why should i use vrsc" but hope some of the above can help answer your curiosity and explain more about what's "under the hood" of the blockchain, what's been done, what's in the works ðŸ˜ƒ

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> "from company view" -> why should I use vrsc pbaas instead of e.g. eth contracts or iota qubics etc.

[20-Nov-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi @dude, The reason I think someone who cares about building an application might choose to use PBaaS is the same reason we chose to make a new blockchain to solve key challenges in crypto. We wanted an independent chain with its own rules and capabilities that simply didn't exist. We wanted to leverage what we felt was the most secure option at the time, Komodo with dPoW and to enhance security and capability over the base starting point. We wanted a way to provision PBaaS chains for the applications described in the vision paper, and no decentralized solutions existed.
We have already developed some of the most secure new blockchain protocols and foundation in use today for public, truly decentralized P2P systems. In the process, we have leveraged and appropriately enhanced Komodo's crypto-condition technology that is behind Stake Guard, paving the way for what we need to develop PBaaS crypto conditions. There's still work to do to get to PBaaS chains, but when we do, we expect Verus applications to have their own blockchain "classes" with their own rules and crypto-conditions that serve and scale the application. There's not a great limit to what kinds of applications can be built that way, but it's a very different model to one chain, one set of rules, all applications share a VM.

[20-Nov-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @DÍžÍ¥UÍžÍ¦DÍžÍ­EÍžÍ£ Blockchain as a service is, always imho!, a viable way to use a blockchain tech in a business environment....and Verus is trying to pave this way. Today, companies are investing billions in moving their physical servers to a cloud env and for a good reason: computing as a service means a shift from capex to opex, or, simpler, a pay-as-you-go model. If I make cars, my core business are cars and IT is only a supporting infrastrcture or "a cost".

Most, if not all, of IT companies are studying blockchain (as a protocol); ie we have our r&d producing internal reports in the last two years; today there isn't a public crypto that can be used for any business (discussion welcome here) and that's why I am trying to figure out if and how Verus fits.

[20-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> There are thousands of aspects that almost nobody consider in cryptospace, and the price is the most trivial one: would you accept to pay 10$/m the service X and the next month 50$? Or, which is the price to create a Verus subchain?

The #IOTA charger at #elaadNL is already available to the public for charging. For cars not equipped with the required hardware & software, they can still simply charge their car by sending IOTA tokens directly to the charger using a normal IOTA wallet app from their phone...

[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @DÍžÍ¥UÍžÍ¦DÍžÍ­EÍžÍ£ I don't know Iota in details, do you? if yes, can you share some info: what if a customer wants to segregate it's data from the main public chain? how a company can use their services without owning the tokens (and/or how I can accurately forecast the service costs)? thank you!

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> https://images.vogel.de/vogelonline/bdb/1346000/1346022/26.jpg iota works a little bit different. its not really based on a "blockchain" its based on a Tangle

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> you dont need iota to use the iota protocol because transactions are free. you can send 1i to an address and will receive 1i. there is no mining so no fees. You can also send 0i and attach a message

[20-Nov-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> one way to use the iota protocol is by using MAM (Masked Authentificated Messages) where you can build up a Tree (Data Structure) so there you have your own kind of blockchain with sidetrees. every message can be encrypted with a key. if you like to read the message you need the address and the key to decode it

[20-Nov-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> if you are interested into MAM read this blogpost https://medium.com/coinmonks/iota-mam-eloquently-explained-d7505863b413

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> so you only need the tokens to transfer "value" like data from one machine to another. (e.g. one car is selling its data like geo position to a service that will give you best direction from A to B, or a weather station is selling its data to a weather forecast service) that can be just piece of data or a stream.

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> there is also a implementation of what bitcoin dudes would call "lightning network" but its called "flash channels" in iota (btw its still working and open sourced for over ~ 12 month. so you make instant transactions between peers from one "master address" to another, which is working by using WebRTC

[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> @John Westbrook An idea regarding syncing the explorer. Why not have the explorer sync once a day, and while its syncing use the last synced cache version of the block chain for the explorer. That way it is synced daily, and users still have access to it. Just display a warning at the top informing the last sync cycle. That should increase usability.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The Verus dApp developers will have to stake to publish their mainnet smart contracts, right? Once you guys have the smart contracts functionality out.

[20-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And each smart contract creates a new blockchain with its own currency by default?

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Good afternoon, Is Verus an Independent asset chain on komodo (runtime fork) or a full fork of komodo?

[20-Nov-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Good idea @evilwar I'm not sure yet if that's possible with the current code as I'm not super familiar with the base code and how it works with the db...but i'm sure it's possible at some level ðŸ˜ƒ

[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> Hey @Diabolik , found a video about conflicts between permissionless blockchains and GDPR. You might like it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I3wYAwbKMM

Will GDPR kill blockchains?
Will the new European privacy law kill blockchains? On first sight they seem incompatible with each other. So let's take a closer look! ðŸ“š Sources This video ...

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If sapling can eventually enable private z-transactions over mobile does that mean that truly private messaging and communication may be a thing? Like a mobile text messenger service that can't be snooped in on.
