Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)
Blockchain-as-a-Service allows outsourcing of blockchain hosting, maintenance and support work to external providers

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Now picture a more decentralized version, not subject to many of the weaknesses of what is currently offered.
PBaaS: or Public Blockchain as a Service is a revolutionary new take on the blockchain as a service model entirely unique to Verus that offers the tools and necessary means to build on and utilize blockchain technology for business or personal use. It is similar to using a web hosting service to build a website with, but rather than having to build one by yourself from scratch, the service provider supplies the basics and handles all the necessary tasks from general upkeep to infrastructure maintenance. Since Verus doesn't rely on a centralized authority to work, there isn't any one single point of failure in the network, so in the event of a hack, power failure, data breach or loss, Verus' system is immune while the other options aren't. Instead of relying on a centralized system, Verus elegantly does work for the public by utilizing the public to do work.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Just trying to find relevant info to help get psyched up!

[12-Mar-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if that explanation would've been written by juniper, it probably said 'runs on the fabric of the internet'

[12-Mar-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and please continue posting such info @Godballz i appreciate it

[12-Mar-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Crabby Paddy see your DM please. it contains an excuse for being too rude before, which wasnt fair from me. but your spamming wasn't approved of either 😉

[12-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> for some perspective, the behaviour you've exposed would resemble the one of a scammer to quite a remarkable degree. even if legit, it may lower peoples alarmedness about similar, probably malicious offers in the future, and we cannot have that happen in here.

[12-Mar-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> me personally i'm fighting rather hard to have everything we do here verifiable and transparent and safe as much as possible. i'm not a fan at all of something that will interfere with that.

[12-Mar-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mrtzmp3> @0x03 might have come across spammy but he is legit , can confirm that i recieved airdrop of 15 k OUR . @Crabby Paddy

[12-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mrtzmp3> Thx again

[12-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> legitimateness wasnt actually the point, but thanks for verifying!

@Asher @miketout @englal ?

[13-Mar-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @runningwithbeer someone will fill that out in the next day or two

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes you can, but it's probably going to take a while before that amount hits a block 😄

[13-Mar-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> do you have a staking pool to recommend?  gianasis for pool is great for me ..

[13-Mar-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> as in mining pool

[13-Mar-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> now i want to find a staking pool!

[13-Mar-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> am reading the guides on medium

[13-Mar-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> bringing this conversation over to staking

[13-Mar-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know of only one staking pool, and you are already on it.

[13-Mar-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> can someone answer my 2 questions above?

[13-Mar-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sorry, I can answer, but it would be nonsense... a more knowledgeable person should answer that...

[13-Mar-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude I see three questions. First, transactions per second now are limited to a single blockchain, and I believe currently would max out at under 300 tps for a single blockchain. The design of PBaaS effectively eliminates this speed barrier by scaling up to a virtually unlimited number of chains. For example, only 1000 chains makes that a 300k limit across the system.we are not concerned as much about marketing specific numbers right now as we are about making the entire system scale. At some point, the goal would be thousands of blockchains operating across the Verus ecosystem. I don’t understand your question about MQTT, but there is no interface to MQTT at this time. It would not be hard. As far as the decimal. One Satoshi is 1/100000000 of a coin and amounts are stored in Satoshis, so you can have 8 decimal places.

[13-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> ok thanks for answering that, you are right three questions 😄 but I dont really understand the last answer or I may have not really clearified why this value is strange for me. When there were rewards for the miners/stakers in the past like 48, 96, 192, 384 VRSC/Block how can this floating value exist in the current supply from the example above (0.02537829)? The current circulating supply should be dividable by 6 or like current_supply % 6 = 0 how can these decimal places be NOT null in the explorer, when the rewards were 384, 192, 96, 48, 24 until now in  the past ?

[13-Mar-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> eg 38585034.13030189 is current circulating supply. 38585034 is dividable by 6 but what is with that decimal places? how can they ever exist in total circulating supply? .13030189 should be .00000000

[13-Mar-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ``Era 1: Block 0 - 10080 reward: 0 to 384, rising linearly and changing each block``
<https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf>, page 21.
The first 10080 blocks were "decimal rewards" up to 384.

[13-Mar-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @zpajk is exactly correct. many decimal rewards were issued in the early days.

[13-Mar-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @FishyGuts as per the Vision paper, the ID system is in phase III, after PBaaS, which is in phase II. the ID system is definitely not a focus right now and when it is, it will be built using PBaaS. The system will be quite complete for many uses well before that, and I fully expect people to use existing ID systems along with PBaaS as well

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OK - deleted everything - moved the Agama 'install' folder to a new location (this created a new request for firewall settings) and now it appears to be working.

[14-Mar-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> strange. seems like something was off with the first install.

[14-Mar-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> There was a pop-up for the stock Windows firewall to open up for the daemon - and it got hidden for a while under another window before I saw it.  Maybe that lag created some issue or created something happening out of the normal sequence...  working now.
