[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or plasterization

[22-Feb-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it should probably go onto the paper wallet step by step guide as well, right

[22-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I’m getting plasterization tonight

[22-Feb-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> is that some slang for 'completely intoxicated'

[22-Feb-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <micro5988> can I sell here?? please pin me so I see response??

Is there a discrete implementation of verushash, or is https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/blob/master/src/crypto/verus_hash.cpp the defacto reference implementation?

[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Anyone know what's up with cryptobridge doing wallet maintenance? Over 2 days now....

[24-Feb-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103> I know right

[24-Feb-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> I sent 6k verus before it went in to maintenance... not received... gone from exchange... sitting in limbo somewhere...

[24-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jonske1 I have a question to them outstanding

[24-Feb-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Yeah I have emailed them and asked in their discord. Even though it was sent prior to the wallet maintenance I'm told I have to wait until wallet comes back online...

[24-Feb-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Over 2 days now.

[24-Feb-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> @jonske1 from experience with Pirate, it will show up.

[24-Feb-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> You will have to wait for the wallet I come back up and the exchange wallets to rescan.

[24-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Anyone here had deposit  issues with Digital Price Exchange? I think that exchange is a scam.

[24-Feb-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> In the last 6 or 7 months, I've never heard of a withdrawal or deposit problem that wasn't resolved quickly, and what I have heard of was rare

[24-Feb-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @markv firstly, dp has worked perfectly with me. Secondly, u can talk directly with the developers on their discord if u have a problem.

[24-Feb-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have made quit a few deposits of BTC and VRSC to dp without issue. On the other hand, that is what everyone says until they have a problem. I had a withdrawal from liqui.com take 28 days last year, with no response from support. Everyone just blew it off and said they never had a problem... look where liqui.com is now

[24-Feb-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So far though I have been pleased with DP since I started using it in September

[24-Feb-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Railrain> When I made my first deposit VRSC attempt about 6 months ago, I was surprised to find out via support that the deposit starts in 15 minutes after your transfer - if you mean this, @markv  - In the trade interface, they are not indicated anywhere. 😬 
The current experience of the ARRR deposit has shown that twenty confirmations start to count in ~ 30 minutes after your transfer.😕

[24-Feb-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah, I've used Digital Price for months without issue and have actually had one of the better exchange experiences there. I remember contacting them for a similar issue and not only did they get back to me promptly but they did so to notify me that the issue should be resolved and when I checked, it was.

[24-Feb-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> they're probably not scamming people. i had one or two sparrings with their support i wasn't a huge fan of, but DP definitely is one of the less-trouble-giving exchanges.

[24-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Both ukminer17 and myself have used digital price this week. Deposits, withdrawals and trades all worked fine for us. They have a slow server but they the only criticism I have.

[24-Feb-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <triplex> @markv What issues are you facing? Did you open a ticket? If yes please give me the ticket number

[24-Feb-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <triplex> Please DM me as i may not see your replies here

[24-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> I had a minor issue with withdrawing from DP once but I opened a ticket and they fixed it right away... They are certainly not a scam

[24-Feb-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @markv: I have used DP extensively since last July and it has been very good. I had one issue where some withdrawals were marked as "rejected" but they responded nearly immediately to an inquiry and all was resolved in the space of an hour or so. I have asked general questions of their support team and received quick responses. They are as good an online service as any I have ever used and better than most.

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Wow, @Godballz, that was an amazing and comprehensive writeup...great job! 👌

[25-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks, I appreciate it. 😀  Hopefully more and more people continue to see the technical benefits that Verus already offers right this minute. The fact that we have one of the most experienced and passionate development teams, consistently pushing updates and communicating with the community is a major strength that not many other projects can claim to have. Looking forward to the upcoming capabilities and what lies ahead..

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> *We have just made the announcement for immediate availability of VerusPay, WooCommerce payment gateway, written by Verus community's own @John Westbrook . As far as we know, this is the first self-sovereign payment gateway that supports optional private Sapling payments as well. Here are the Reddit and Twitter announces so you can spread the word.* 

Very proud of the team for this accomplishment.  We were working on this recently but our solution was not elegant like this.  Very well done Verus Team, @John Westbrook for the Gateway and @michaeltoutjr for VerusPay.

[25-Feb-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Very cool! 😛

[25-Feb-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Vycid was thinking about your theory of FPGA purchases redirecting funds that people might otherwise use for buying, and it's actually pretty interesting in a couple ways. First, I agree that at least temporarily, until velocity of the money supply evens it out, it is likely to have such an effect if the sellers then sell Verus and keep none. At the same time, one interesting thought that came to mind is which would get you more mining/staking power, an FPGA for Verus or the Verus itself? Over the long run, the answer should be that you would earn more by spending it to buy the FPGA, or someone else is getting the better deal.

[25-Feb-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @miketout yeah, that's an interesting question. I know for sure that the 50/50 split is definitely very supportive of the price. Usually the triple-digit annual inflation rates will sink new coins before they can take off

[25-Feb-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> There's probably some equilibrium point, where the competition over the hashrate reaches a point where it's better to stake. But every time a new generation of hardware comes out (in this case ASIC) that equilibrium is disrupted and you get some capital outflow

[25-Feb-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's funny, I was thinking about that too. Staking the same amount of Verus extends the catch up time somewhat. That is a good point you two make, not only are funds temporarily redirected to the device sales but the sellers are going to be converting as well which would have a double whammy effect. Considering this, it isnt too bad a drop and I'll be interested to see as time goes on a likely good rebound effect since things still seem to be holding up pretty well, bear in mind the whole market is a bit wonky at the moment

[25-Feb-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Ice Lake with 512 bit CLMUL could potentially be another disruptor

[25-Feb-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Vycid yes I'm very interested in seeing what Ice Lake can do as well

[25-Feb-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Especially against the rumored 64 core AMD offering

[26-Feb-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Buying equipment for mining increases your risk exposure though. Especially specialized equipment. How long will an FPGA retain any resale value? Depends on the market. Also depends on competition. If I buy Verus, I eliminate everything but the market risk.

[26-Feb-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> For the cost of the ukminer I could buy about 4300 verus. And with swing trading I could probably turn that into 5-6000 in a short time

[26-Feb-19 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> can't put the ukminer on a credit card either to spread out the capital expense

[26-Feb-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Wow, UKMiner doesn't have a credit card processor?

[26-Feb-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> They need to get on that

[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> what a surprise, cypherpunks not using fiat for their crypto business

[26-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @Emmanuel as anyone who runs an ecommerce site will tell you, you want to make the checkout process as painless as possible

[26-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> You are excluding a lot of potential customers by not taking credit cards, particularly considering that they are basically a financing option for people

[26-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Mining hardware is essentially a business investment, not a personal purchase

[26-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Of course accepting cards opens you to up to all kind of bullshit like chargebacks. Then again, I am more inclined to trust companies that aren't afraid of chargebacks than those that clearly are

[26-Feb-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Crypto is trustless, pre-orders aren't. I will never again pay for a pre-order with crypto - learned my lesson there. But a credit card? Sure, I'm protected

[26-Feb-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have no issue with them not accepting cards, but the point you are trying to make @Emmanuel would be stronger if they were not pricing the cards in fiat.

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well at one point there was a massive miner that accounted for a lot of the hashrate. They could have accumulated an amount up there

[26-Feb-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I believe that may be Supernet, if I'm not mistaken. As with everyone else, all mined, staked, and/or purchased coins.

[26-Feb-19 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> What's Supernet?

[26-Feb-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> As I understand it, it is a Komodo ecosystem basket of sorts. They have been mining, staking, and sometimes purchasing from the beginning.

[26-Feb-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> SuperNET became Komodo Platform.
There is also the SUPERNET asset, which is a fund, and a komodo assetchain.

[26-Feb-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Definitely going to have to read more on this. I've never heard of it. Is this similar to the mshark thing someone mentioned the other day?

[26-Feb-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
