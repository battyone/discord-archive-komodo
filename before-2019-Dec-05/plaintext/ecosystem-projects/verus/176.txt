[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> i noticed that the wallets were sitting at the root

[08-Jun-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> i've moved them to a komodo folder in the f:\ drive

[08-Jun-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> maybe i didnt copy some files over

[08-Jun-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Kaizen üëâüèª Crypto-Mob.com> I decided to create I collection for your project on my website. Let me know what you think

[09-Jun-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Kaizen üëâüèª Crypto-Mob.com great initiative. Can I pay with Verus?

[09-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can't wait till it gets here. In my head, I imagine walking around wearing it and then bumping into another fellow member like it's fight club or something. ü§º üòÇ

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me check real quick.

[09-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> landing page is ok, but then links dont seem to work

[09-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Which wallet were you trying?

[09-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ok seems better now

[09-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> that was weird though

[09-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn't do anything (yet)

[09-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> maaaybe my browser but dont think so

[09-Jun-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> or maybe site is getting lots of traffic?

[09-Jun-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll check the services, just to be sure...

[09-Jun-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks

[09-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Services on the site all OK... It may be related to Github, where the files reside... We have no control over that

[09-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> after this Agama hack i suddenly became concerned the Verus website was getting hacked, and the hacker was uploading a malicious wallet for users to DL

[09-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> obv paranoid

[09-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> but still its the only safe wallet now

[09-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Believe me, @0x03 is not someone to take security lightly

[09-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> good to know

[09-Jun-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> I have question here: Is VERUS mineable?
I have a small stack of them but right now can't find them traded anywhere else that digitalprice, (and not on CMC) how can I boost my stack a bit??

[09-Jun-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus is minable & stakable... our community developed wallet can mine and stake simultaneously. Alternatively you can mine and/or stake at pools.
Check our website for the possibilities: https://Veruscoin.io

[09-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> hello anybody here mines on x5650 ?

[09-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't think so. No AES and no AVX, which makes it a slow processor on Verushash

[09-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> it has AES

[09-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> i have 7x 5650 and 5660's

[09-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> 1x 3770k

[09-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> and alot of other core 2 quad era xeons around 30 of them

[09-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> most of them installed in my GPU mining farm

[09-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> so was wondering if i can put them to good use

[09-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can try the miners from our webpage.

[09-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The one posted above

[09-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> i looked on the bitcoin talk

[09-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> main thread, found no miners

[09-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> What do you mean? There are several miners (plural) listed.

[09-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> oh right

[09-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> sorry

[09-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> there are more than one in the page

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ok.üëå

[09-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> do you have and idea if mining this coin

[09-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> stresses a cpu till it pull it's full TDP rating

[09-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> or not ?

[09-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it will go to full TDP

[09-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> so it's pretty heavy

[09-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> The x5650 will have basically no hashrate.

[09-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I‚Äôve tested same gen.

[09-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Due to as mentioned doesn‚Äôt support the required instructions.

[09-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> hmmm

[09-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> but on the intel page it says that it has AES-NI

[09-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> support

[09-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ark intel states otherwise.

[09-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> no avx though

[09-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> ok wait

[09-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> scroll down to "Security & Reliability"

[09-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> on ark intel

[09-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> you will find

[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> Intel¬Æ AES New Instructions
Yes

Intel¬Æ Trusted Execution Technology ‚Ä°
Yes

Yes

[09-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> this is the first generation to support AES

[09-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, I'ld say, test and findout

[09-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> ok i will do it when time allows

[09-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> thanks for the input

[09-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @skyboyextreme aes sure but avx no. And that is the main boy

[09-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I thought the same thing.

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Was worse than my celaron xD

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> so it's not either

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> must be having both ?

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Yeah best with both.

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> oh well

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Basic rule is basically anything 2010 and older is out

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> maybe i will put them on the golem network or something then
