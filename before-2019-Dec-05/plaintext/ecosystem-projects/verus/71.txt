[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> If its quality and supporting a project...cpu and gpu miners still ahve their part

[05-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> supporting a project by advertising or buy demand sure, but not securing pow

[05-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> And absolutely no coin or token is immune to rapidly advancing technology

[05-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> unless you have free or damn near free power

[05-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I reccomend reading SIA coins blog about asics

[05-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm not foolish enough to mine at a loss when  it would be better to mine XMR and trade to VRSC

[05-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop it was true when we said it, and we're not saying that until it's true again. that does not define the project

[05-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> check the mining calculator and decide. right now, it's not so bad.

[05-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> lol, because the FPGAs are offline

[05-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> short-term noise

[05-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the FUD is short term noise

[05-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> FPGAs being on the network isn't FUD

[05-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes it is

[05-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> how

[05-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's a factual statement

[05-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> this moment in time, no, because they are offline

[05-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> but in two days, same old action

[05-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> enough feeding the hype train, Im out

[05-Dec-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> because if people understand that it will be a reality for all coins, we could instead consider it a great opportunity if we do get to move to hardware in a way everyone in the community can participate in, as well as keep CPUs and GPUs possible for casual mining. that's what we're working towards. screaming "FPGA fire!" when the community is working on serious technical decisions and cooperation that can be quite good is an attempt to harm

[05-Dec-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> perfect timing...rewarded with a stake

[05-Dec-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout I have a ton of respect for you, I genuinely wish this gets resolved sooner rather than latter, but at this time, I cannot see how the gap can possibly be closed

[05-Dec-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> the performance gap is just too out of reach

[05-Dec-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I welcome surprises though!

[05-Dec-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> just because I no longer POW mine Verus doesn't mean I'm not staking. I just liked the balance of CPU/GPU miners

[05-Dec-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> if you are serious about something, shouldn't you put money and/or effort into it?

[05-Dec-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> @bishop 
*miketout I have a ton of respect for you, I genuinely wish this gets resolved sooner rather than latter, but at this time, I cannot see how the gap can possibly be closed
the performance gap is just too out of reach*

Wasn't the same the case just recently.
When you make a cake, you break a few eggs.  
These eggs will get cooked into the recipie somehow and the coin will survive.
Hardware advancements are inevitable.   Lookup Moore's Law.  
The best that can be done long term is to look at fundamentals (and if you think a great coin like VERUS was just started because of an algorithm or to support miners incomes, then I have news for you). 
Features and methods change.

[05-Dec-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> 100 years ago doctors gave you Cocaine and Morphine for a cold or flu.  Cars only functioned on gas.  Computers were not even a thought in anyones mind.

[05-Dec-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Being adaptable is key.   While I do see this as a community coin, the development team will ultimately be able to determine what's going to be the best course of action.

[05-Dec-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @FishyGuts ` if you think a great coin like VERUS was just started because of an algorithm or to support miners incomes, then I have news for you` no where did I say that

[05-Dec-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> You're right, and I did not mean to infer that to you... I was more speaking generally at that point, sorry. 

Lining miners pockets through algorithm games because of hardware advancements has never sat well with me, even as someone who started in crypto with mining, but that's just opinion.

[05-Dec-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I've largely said my peace, if the community decides to keep the large advantage of FPGAs, then so be it, but then at the very least the references to GPU and CPU mining should go away. As I used as an example prior, you don't see Bitcoin advertising CPU or GPU mining even when both can hash SHA256 because it would be silly. Same situation would be the case here

[05-Dec-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I don't need to beat a dead horse, I've said what I needed to say, others can contribute their thoughts as well, that's what makes a community coin great.

[05-Dec-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Did Bitcoin take the inference of "one cpu one vote" out of their whitepaper?  I certainly don't think Verus will continue with false advertising based on the actions they take.  

This is what we call a speedbump for a great project like this.

[05-Dec-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> not referring to the whitepaper. I'm talking the website and the BCT thread

[05-Dec-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Things take time to update.
The Discord ann can be transferred by a community member if you wish.  Maybe the team overlooked it, or haven't had the moment to jump over there and update it.  
As silly as that sounds, it happens.

[05-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Hell, look at the Pirate Website ðŸ˜‚

[05-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> That's gonna be done finally in the next week or so.  I gotta say it's looking really pretty.

[05-Dec-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think it's important to note that some of the loudest voices in this channel right now are not actually in Verus at all. While everyone's opinion can be important, it would be dangerous to allow the conversation and decision to be driven by people who have no stake in the coin at all.

[05-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I must say.  The times early on I spoke with mike.  He has been very levelminded.  Iâ€™m confident the development team will find the best of solutions.  Lately these events seem quite stressful.  Iâ€™m not following too closely.  But are there trolls here?   I donâ€™t see fgpa a big issue. Is it?   Itâ€™s been a fair launch.

[05-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I'd say the devil you know is better than the devil you don't applies in this situation as some have mentioned. Maybe the foundation should purchase one of these miners to aid in development

[05-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Dec-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @@miketout Which is the issue FPGA are causing, other than reduced (or none) profit for hobbyst? When you release something in the wild, you can't keep fighting for every thing doesn't align with the vision or you will get overwhelmed. I can understand the "decentralization vision" but, forcing someone to stop a behaviour isn't and probably Verus will be attacked for this. Assuming everybody in the world has the same hardware and can only mine the same amount, what if tomorrow arise a much more profitable coin and all miners switch to it? Imho, the mining should be considered a simple transport protocol (you can run a tor node or a wifi hotspot in your house for your pleasure but you are not paid for it) it cannot be "The big thing" or the core of a project. It may be a too ahead of times vision but totally aligned with today IT paradigms

[05-Dec-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I still haven't seen a good argument from the doomsayers why people can't just buy the FPGA and continue on

[05-Dec-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I could understand that argument *before* the tech and supplier were known, but now they are

[05-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> From my admittedly very limited understanding the fpgas seem superior in every way to GPUs, and even ASICs so why so desperately cling onto some nostalgia tech?

[05-Dec-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig some people dont have 2.5k. And, it limits growth of VRSC to FPGA miners and traders, less casual people.

[05-Dec-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Where do you draw that line then? Some people don't have $400 for a GPU, or even $1 for a GPU. There will always be someone who can afford bigger and better than you

[05-Dec-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> Tbh thatâ€™s like saying they should make it so people can only single gpu mine and itâ€™s unfair people buy 100s of gpus

[05-Dec-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> Miners will mine either way

[05-Dec-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Find 4 other people and split it 5 ways

[05-Dec-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> Whether fpga or not, theyâ€™ll just buy 10000 cups or gpus same end game. I donâ€™t mine with fpga, but itâ€™s not that much of a negative imo

[05-Dec-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Patrick ManBearPig it may sound rude, but imho crypto has given the illusion that everybody can make money; in any other industrial sector, a thing more energy efficient (and, thus, with less operational costs) is considered a God's gift, here is an Evil sneaky idea. I never seen someone scream at AMD, just example, because their new cpu is more powerful with less watts ðŸ˜ƒ 

@Gloryman Some (almost all tbh) people don't have the billions needed to run a datacenter, but everybody turn on VMs using Google, Azure, etc.... What's the point? Blockchain, as well as any other tech, is an enabler for something else; as long as it is considered the end point instead of the starting point, it is useless. Imho, of course

[05-Dec-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig $400 GPU doesnt stop someone with a laptop at home making money off their terrible cpu

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> fpgas do

[05-Dec-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Shouldn't something be done to stop people with a dozen threadrippers so it's more fair for the guy with the single celeron then?

[05-Dec-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "It's not fair" is not a good argument

[05-Dec-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> buying more threadrippers is less efficient than buying gpus

[05-Dec-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Buying more gpus is less efficient than buying the fpga

[05-Dec-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> so we are right back at my original statement of not seeing a good argument why someone can't buy the fpga. "I can't afford it" doesn't cut it

[05-Dec-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If you were talking about something that costs hundreds of thousands maybe

[05-Dec-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I've already explained to you the argument of distribution and limiting growth. If you cant understand these concepts, just leave it at that.
