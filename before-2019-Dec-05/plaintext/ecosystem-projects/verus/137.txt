[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> How about perfection

[04-Apr-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> same

[04-Apr-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> _*most*_ of those simply female...

[04-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> How about changing Verus to Vera?

[04-Apr-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol it would make things a lot easier

[04-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or something more mystical: "Veritas Veritatum, et omnia Verus" ... doesn't make sense, but looks good üòÑ

[04-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> what about worth or merit?

[04-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> would either be Virtus again, or Meritum - which is neuter.

[04-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> getting confused here üòÑ

[04-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> A bit Harry Potter spell lookalike, veritas veritatum.....

[04-Apr-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> originally its vanitas vanitatum, et omnia vanitas ... however... we don't want that üòâ

[04-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not really...

[04-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But since the majority of words describing a character property are female, we‚Äôre running out of options....

[04-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> think about a good noun that is  male in your own language ... there isn't too much

[04-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Contradictio in terminus

[04-Apr-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> -minis. But yes, it is.

[04-Apr-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Damn, I feel like a Hebrew lectured by a Roman.....

[04-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahaha

[04-Apr-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> sumus et fore speramus

[04-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> wij zijn en hopen te worden

[04-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> no, don't think it works... ^^

[04-Apr-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In Dutch??? I‚Äôm amazed....

[04-Apr-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> found it on wikipedia üòâ

[04-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahaha, Motto of the dutch royal naval Institute... that‚Äôs why I remembered....

[04-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> that's where I found it üòâ

[04-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but back to topic: Any more ideas for suitable male nouns?

[04-Apr-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Consensus is male....

[04-Apr-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, this would work

[04-Apr-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We could use that, since the blockchain is a consensus system

[04-Apr-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You may want to check this for your ideas: https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Latin_masculine_nouns

[04-Apr-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> seen too many already...

[04-Apr-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> But when thinking about it, Consensus would be a really good match, because it's simply true üòâ

[04-Apr-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> boy, I need a break üòâ

[04-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, I say you deserve a break...

[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> Network (GH/s)  342.3479  üåã  Highest it has been since the algo change ?

[04-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if hellcatz' price display on luckpool is any correct i would guess a connection between nethash and that üòâ

[04-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Yea you def need a break. I agree consensus works

[04-Apr-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Let's make a voting: When using "consensus", we'd have these: 
"**Verus Consensus  Non Emitur**" or "**Verus Consensus non potest emi**";  English: "**True Consensus Cannot Be Bought**"
Who's for, who's against?

[04-Apr-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> final decision would of course be at @team

[04-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @0x03 his price is correct. Price jumped up!

[04-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> me gusta

[04-Apr-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> nothing out of the ordinary at stex though

[04-Apr-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> ok, made a quick sketch edit to change the words, modify the heartbeat so it's in the right position and the angles on the top of theV

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> comments?

[05-Apr-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think that looks really cool!

[05-Apr-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And legit.

[05-Apr-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Sweet, I'll get on the digital proof

[05-Apr-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't know what other people think but that has come a long way and I like the new text

[05-Apr-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Nice going @Draeth! I like how it says that consensus can't be bought, it makes you think how valuable decentralization truly is

[05-Apr-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Thoskk & @Draeth  Awesome! Thank you! @Thoskk we will edit the paper for next release as well.

[05-Apr-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and @Godballz and all who provided feedback as well üòÉ

[05-Apr-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Draeth One thing I noticed...  consensus needs to be spelled with an "s" instead of a "c" in the English version

[05-Apr-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> ah, sorry, was tying too fast lol

[05-Apr-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I can do gold tho

[05-Apr-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess it would be a little expensive, right?

[05-Apr-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Negative

[05-Apr-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Same price

[05-Apr-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sounds interesting ... how much would you estimate?
