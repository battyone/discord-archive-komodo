[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Eventually hopefully it is more widespread and you can pick them up at Microcenter with a warranty

[24-Dec-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> There was no 1 person farming via fpga that nobody could get

[24-Dec-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It’s next gen tech so of course adoption takes time

[24-Dec-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah but why hide the name and not let anyone in the corps Community now who could stand to benefit as well?

[24-Dec-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Most miners know nothing about fpga’s

[24-Dec-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> There wasn’t a single thing stopping any verus person here from grabbing an F1 and supporting the coin with higher efficiency

[24-Dec-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If only anyone knew such a company existed

[24-Dec-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> As soon as this discord found out they could have looked into the hardware and started buying

[24-Dec-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> And enjoyed greater flexibility, power costs and hash rates

[24-Dec-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Which would have only strengthened the network further

[24-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Anyway, here's to the future and any advancements in technology, be it in hardware or software.

[24-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Anyways, always happy to have discourse, we’ll see how it all works out:) happy holidays

[24-Dec-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Ill chime in and say I agree with the fact that technology is always advancing and it cant be stifled.  I looked into FPGAs.  But the thing was the secrecy about the mining.  But again, its not like it has to be fair.  Just kinda shady

[24-Dec-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks! Happy holidays to you as well!

[24-Dec-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Hiding of the coin was more for shady developers that try to steal bitstreams and from devs making knee jerk reactions

[24-Dec-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> I do agree it needs to be handled better in the future

[24-Dec-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It’s a slippery slope with new hardware

[24-Dec-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> But in terms of hardware availability etc, it’s more than fair

[24-Dec-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> No bitmain shenanigans

[24-Dec-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I agree with that

[24-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's refreshing to be able to discuss these differing opinions in a civilized manner because at the end of the day I think we all pretty much want the same things, everyone wants the project to do well.

[24-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm actually doing some very last minute holiday shopping right now...

[24-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Ugh.

[24-Dec-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Good times lol

[24-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is no knee jerk here. your are making many false assumptions, and insulting people by claiming their ignorance where it doesn't exist. it's holidays. i will be happy to come back and discuss, but there was secret mining and sales of a promise of an unnamed algorithm on hardware that leveraged its significant advantage to take more of the profits from the network than all other miners, who invested to support the project. if you don't understand the plan, i'm sorry, but calling people knee jerk and making false assumptions that contradict the announcements about motivation isn't really the way we usually do things around here, also not what I did when visiting the FPGA Discord. good to meet you. happy holidays to you too.

[24-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Leveraging hardware is what mining is

[24-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> I’m not gonna argue about it, you guys made the choice and you’ll deal with whatever comes next

[24-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Happy Holidays:)

[24-Dec-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Nice veiled threat. Just as someone, and some of us know who, decided that rather than openly making their offering available to everyone who already was mining with different hardware out of interest in the project, they would sell secretly to a small number of people (centralized by definition) who didn’t know more about Verus than that they could spend less money by being covert and taking for a few secret miners the rewards designed (obviously with some prior weaknesses) to incentivize decentralization. If you’d prefer to further convince the community that we didn’t go far enough in response, that’s up to you, but we don’t usually react in a knee jerk fashion, so, as you said, we’ll see.

[24-Dec-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you keep saying small number of people as if the hardware was closed door and not available to everyone. If anything thats a veiled attempt to prop up your centralization statements. There was no threat there, you're a dev; you made the changes and are responsible for whatever comes of it. To try and make that seem like a threat is a bit childish

[24-Dec-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it was

[24-Dec-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the algo is still not named

[24-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> what does it being named do to you?

[24-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> are you able to go and buy the hardware right now if you want to?

[24-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @uchirosan It sounds like you said what you wanted to. Now you are carrying on. He didn't say that like it was a threat.

[24-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> only existing purchasers of the F1 could even know what it was, while many in the community would have purchased if it was open. not a smart decision at all IMO, but that was their decision.

[24-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> no one came here to tell us about it. all secret

[24-Dec-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm not saying that hiding the bitstreams is the best course of action

[24-Dec-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i dont think anyone in the fpga space wants that long term

[24-Dec-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> because the people who did it thought they could more easily sell secret miners that were NOT available easily to everyone than if everyone knew. that was the point

[24-Dec-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> mining is a competitive space as i'm sure you know

[24-Dec-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and it will be again

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> groups will alot of money have and will always have an advantage

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> privacy of coin names is to help protect against larger entities stealing bitstreams

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> almost all bitstream devs are working on teh same algo's

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> across groups and companies

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> open and available technology is great. when we see secret tech being used, we will respond

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the algo was secret, not the tech

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> please be clear on that

[24-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> now, everyone gets a fresh chance to try again the right way

[24-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> ignorance of the tech doesnt make it secret

[24-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> implementation of the algo is tech

[24-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just as is the new implementation

[24-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> f1 team is the only ones that even looked at verus for whatever reason

[24-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> not sure what their reasoning was on choosing your algo

[24-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but they did

[24-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> we've had long discussions about the idea of secret algo'

[24-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and there's conflicting ideas on both sides

[24-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and we tried to work with them. maybe we still will, but the secret mining was not ok with our community, and I invented the new algo for the community

[24-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you guys asked for their code didnt you?

[24-Dec-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> just so i understand, its your position that all technology types should be relatively equal in performance?

[24-Dec-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What other project would have an FPGA bounty, as large as this one?  Hell, what other project would even offer a bounty?

[24-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the bounty isn't there to help fpga's its to see what fpga's can do and to make adjustments to the algo if necessary

[24-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> don't mistake the reasoning

[24-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lol

[24-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's not exactly true. i wrote what is the community's general position in the announcement. it's more a matter of not centralizing by doing exactly what was done. if everyone knows about and can get FPGAs, great, but we are going to work to make various computing hardware useful for mining

[24-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are not doing anything covertly

[24-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the bounty is honest

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It is.

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is to prevent secrecy

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the bounty as stated is to see if someone makes a fpga bitstream that is 10 times faster

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> then what happens?

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> ther algo is adjusted to bring it down closer to gpu/cpu?

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there will be more than one because to get the bounty, it should be open

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats not what i'm asking

[24-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> what happens if the performance is greater than 1.5x

[24-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> say 10 or 20x

[24-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> my initial statements to the community was a target of < 5x. we will see what it gets

[24-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have no interest in preventing FPGAs from having a role in the community.

[24-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so your saying a $2500-4k device should be <5x a 300 device?

[24-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> price/performance

[24-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i will be interested to see if anyone can get 5x

[24-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> price/performance optimizations is exactly what crypto hardware is all about

[24-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> to you

[24-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> having 20x performance of a 1080ti at 30% of the power use t hat anyone can buy is a good thing

[24-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> there's no hoarding of hardware

[24-Dec-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i believe it is actually all a proxy for decentralization

[24-Dec-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> which for many might just be words, but we are not just spouting words.

[24-Dec-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> how long do you anticipate gpu miner being available after fork?

[24-Dec-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it actually doesn't matter to me if that happens on any particular hardware

[24-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is not up to me, as I'm doing other things. i am helping at least one GPU dev who is making great progress, and there are others. I don't want to speak for him, but it's conceivable he will be ready by the fork. It may surprise you, but I am also helping at least one FPGA dev to understand as well. so far, it seems most people who have looked at the algo may not understand it fully yet.

[24-Dec-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but the people who have come to ask for help or those who are working on behalf of the community certainly are welcome to do so

[24-Dec-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> other than the f1 team none of the other devs i know for other fpga's were working on verus algo

[24-Dec-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i guess you don't know them all

[24-Dec-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm just referring to the ones I know active  on the bcu side

[24-Dec-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> there are lots of devs out there

[24-Dec-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> though the amount working on meaningful fpga implementations for non-secret use is pretty small

[24-Dec-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> most will go to large farms that we never hear about

[24-Dec-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @uchirosan Mike is actually very good for crypto, in general. You will find that he is very knowledgeable and very helpful. I think it's better to have a real, genuine conversation  with him than go back and forth with others here

[24-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> right now the fpga community is at the forefront of a new tech, at least in the general sense since fpga's have been around for a long time even in crypto
