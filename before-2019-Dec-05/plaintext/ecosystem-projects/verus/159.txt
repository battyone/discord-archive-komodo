[07-May-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Same here, Thoskk, but this conversation was worth staying awake for. Thank you for your visions, gentlemen.

[07-May-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> buenos nachos, muchachos 👋

[07-May-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> ¡Hasta la pasta!

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Life is a great experiment - and so is blockchain 😄 nn

[08-May-19 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> binance got hacked

[08-May-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> thats not good for business

[08-May-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Maybe I should check my account....joking. Who keeps their crypto on exchanges?

[08-May-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I cant even get into a working Binance page after logging in

Binance Security Breach Update
We have discovered a large scale security breach today, May 7, 2019 at 17:15:24 (UTC). Hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and potentially other info. The hacker...

[08-May-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Like a boss! CZ is acting unfazed right now

[08-May-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Watching the live ama

[08-May-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> all funds lost are covered.  Just update your security like passwords and api

[08-May-19 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i see the good news have spread already...

[08-May-19 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> besides it's actually quite cool that they seemingly have a 'fund' for user losses, the existence of that fund justifies giving your money to some other exchanges, if binance was able to collect some of it to put it into a fund, they have more than enough already 😃

[08-May-19 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just sayin' 😃

[08-May-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You always know how to lighten the mood...

[08-May-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> dont say the thought isnt plausible at least! 😄

[08-May-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not even just plausible, also very likely...

[08-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> would you rather not have the fund and your coins lost?

[08-May-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> I think it's wise to have it, and I appreciate the transparency.

[08-May-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i generally would rather encourage people not to park their money at exchanges.

[08-May-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> that is relative. Sometime it takes a few days for a trade to get accomplished. Prices are rarely exactly at the level you would like to have them when you log in.

[08-May-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Some people keep their coins on an exchange because it also stakes the coins for them... plain lazyness

[08-May-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> and a few days may also become a few weeks. Yo wouldn't withdraw your coins during that time because you'd loose quite a bit for tx fees.

[08-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> on top of that you'd not be able to quickly respond when prices are changing. Good deals are also a matter of patience.

[08-May-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> so, it's easy to advise not to stash coins on an exchange, but reality looks different.

[08-May-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes. 😃

[08-May-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> let me refine the statement: "Don't leave your assets sitting at an exchange unnecessarily".

[08-May-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you cant give off control over your money (because that is what you actually do when you park it at an exchange) and expect me not to make fun about people that are actually doing it

[08-May-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i am sorry, but you just cannot expect that.

[08-May-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> most of you guys don't trust well-established banks. but then easily trust a (mostly foreign) exchange with your money.

[08-May-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 🤣

[08-May-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm not saying you should trust banks, just to make sure tho

[08-May-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and then another cryptopia, binance or what not gets cracked open

[08-May-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and i am not allowed to joke about it

[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that is not fair

[08-May-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> sure, go ahead. However, it's like an advise not to move your car through a city with heavy traffic or park in a public parking lot close to the street. You also can make fun of people doing it anyway, I just don't think it helps a lot 😉

[08-May-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh well.

[08-May-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> just don't take that personal, I was referring to it in a more general way.

[08-May-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you're not prepared to take the risk that you're car gets damaged, it's actually sound advice

[08-May-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm not taking it personal. it's just that the very core reason that cracked open exchanges are always such a huge problem just stems from the fact that people put more money into exchanges than they should, were they reasonable human beings.

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> true

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If I had a new Ferrari, I probably wouldn't take it into a busy city and park it on the street...

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well if i posess anything that i dont want to lose, i'll treat it with care

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> if you live e.g. in Hong Kong, you'd have no choice. @Oink

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that is some understanding that seemingly is lost with nowadays mankind

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's all about being aware of the risks and the willingness to accept the risk and the consequences.

[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And if I was living on the moon I would worry more about micro-meteorites.

[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> now wait a second. an IT security breach isnt like a micro-meteorite on moon, watched from earth

[08-May-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> yes, that's the point: Be aware of the risks, and do what's necessary to minimize them.

[08-May-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just sayin'

[08-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so, with the staking exchange

[08-May-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i remember one in particular where there were issues for quite a long time where nobody knew about any official statement relating to these issues, from said exchange.

[08-May-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> go on to explain me how this is a good idea to participate in

[08-May-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As far as I can see, it's ready. Just need some extra eyes to scout for issues I may have overlooked:

[08-May-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Very nice 😃 Description text is very small on my 15" screen, though. I can hardly read it. I also tried to click the icons before the button below, many may do the same.

[08-May-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you point at the links, the desription will also pop up..

[08-May-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Icons are not clickable (yet)

[08-May-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Not very intuitive imo 😄

[08-May-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> possibly some sort of seperator between the Video / Text / Social Media sections?

[08-May-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Ginasis Mining Pools already working on it

[08-May-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 😃

[08-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> also possibly ```Links to external sources from various media
No matter who produced the information or what the content is, here we've accumulated links to the information that is available.```

[08-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Been reverting back every time because it looks horrible...

[08-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> center that?

[08-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yep, good one!

[08-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> even if the separator is just a couple extra spaces maybe

[08-May-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'v been trying to break the big white background, without being too intrusive.....

[08-May-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> also my pet peeve of the site currently is that "Explorer" opens in a new window... Not sure what others think...

[08-May-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> that and blog

[08-May-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> 0.6em font size is not very readable for anyone on a 15" screen, and there are plenty of people on even smaller 13" screens which will have the same responsive layout as the 15" screens.

[08-May-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> 0.9em looks ok for that font, tried it now.

[08-May-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Any link that is not on the actual page, breaks out into a new tab. If the explorer was in the same layout I would leave it in the same tab

[08-May-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> fair

[08-May-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink  just add a text-align: center to p.checksum and set font-size: 0.9em and it looks a lot better

[08-May-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll have a go with your suggestions!

[08-May-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> so you can just skip that

[08-May-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> [DELETED] 😄

[08-May-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I already wrote it down,...😆

[08-May-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink  I don´t think text-overflow: elipsis works without white-space: nowrap, and you don´t want only a single line of description.

[08-May-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was just about to removethe nowrap...

[08-May-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> @Oink What do you think about sorting that stuff into columns? Some extra work, I know ...

[08-May-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As in opposed to sorting into rows, like now?

[08-May-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> yes

[08-May-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> What I think you say is: Put the description in a header on top of the links, not to the left as it is right now.
Is that correct?

[08-May-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> excatly, that's what I mean

[08-May-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would mean I have to do the wallet and miner download pages too, to keep a consistent look all over the site

[08-May-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> just if you feel like 😉

[08-May-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not really, no....

[08-May-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> 😄

[08-May-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Maybe in a future update... I would like to replace the current site ASAP.

[08-May-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> I mean, other pages are already kind of column style, you wouldn't have to change them I think

[08-May-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> but do as you feel 😉

[08-May-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This page is basically a copy of the other pages, with the content replaced, so yes, I would have to do them too

[08-May-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> ok

[08-May-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> First the more important matters: spacing, clickable icons and readable descriptions

[08-May-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I would suggest at least fixing this ‘’’Read an watch about VRSC now!’’’

[08-May-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> To read “and”

[08-May-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Although ultimately it’s not a good sentence to start with.
