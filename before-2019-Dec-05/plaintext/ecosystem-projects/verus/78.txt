[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I wish the project good luck with this phase, on the way to achieving its ultimate vision....

[07-Dec-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you @jintaa üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Those who retweet, check #announcements for the latest üòÉ

[07-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Just buy an FPGA ?

[07-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> LOL

[07-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> They would be more decentralised ... as there are heaps of them out there... even totall oper source ones

[07-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> CPUs have back doors, and GPUs use too much power

[07-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> the problem is if they are not willing to meet at the level playing field that is meant to be verus then they wont be had here

[07-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> You cant do that

[07-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> It will never work

[07-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Encourage competition

[07-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> It will fix itself

[07-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> well that is not the goal of verus

[07-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> descentralice never happend

[07-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Well their gola is fatally falwed

[07-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> People want to make money ... the inventive needs to be competition to amke more money

[07-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> i belive in wrong project

[07-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> if one FPGA is dominating

[07-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> make a better one

[07-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> ü§∑

[07-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Making people relay on CPUs which are full of hardware backdoors is a terrible idea

[07-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> its a great idea

[07-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> why you make a really profitable cpu mining algo, and dont usit

[07-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Why and how is that the case .. .there are OPEN SOURCE FPGAs with no backdoors no corperate licensing fees

[07-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> hats is better

[07-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> whats?

[07-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> 30 fpga

[07-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> or 1000 pc with cpu

[07-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Its a better goal of decentralissation to support open source hardware rather than icenced CPUs with back doors

[07-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> and 30 fpga in the same place

[07-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Making more people learn hpw to program FPGA and use open source hardware is 100% better than relying on CPUs which had a monopoly

[07-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> decentralized is only a marketing

[07-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> jajajajja

[07-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> All CPUs are clicenced to 1 company INTEL

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> cpu monopoly?

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> forget AMD CPUs

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> If intel decided they dont liek verus coin ..

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> AMD has to pay licencing to INTEL

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> and vice versa

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> what u saying???

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> they are hte same thing

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Forget GPUs

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> GPUs are only 2 companies

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> i know why mike dont want frok

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> as well ..thats a monopoly aswell

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> he has 2 legs

[07-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> one in verus one in komodo

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Open Source hardware is the way foward.. just start using it

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> and currently FPGA for verus is 1 company that is keeping it a secret

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> and encorage competition

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> talk about monopoly

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> if sometihing wrong with not succed with verus he will jump to komodo

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> So make a better one

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Im sure mike has the money ans skills to do so

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> really secret?

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> you a nme know it

[07-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> what are the secret?

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> There is no secret ...

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Not sure hat you mean

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Dont stifle innovation

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> if someone has an advantage

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> only i know mike will throw verus

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> beat them

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> and he will go to komodo

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> he have the skills

[07-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> to grow up komodo

[07-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Rather than trying to keep everything based on centralised out dated tech ... let it die

[07-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> The world will be a better place

[07-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> you are acting like verus flat out denied FPGAs

[07-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon, you are making some not very nice, untrue statements

[07-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> when that was not the case

[07-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Well you litterally cant do that

[07-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> forking constantly is a terrible solution

[07-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm not sure i understand why you think i would "throw" verus. or jump to some other project.

[07-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Dunno what that guy is on about .. Just voicing my opinion here ...

[07-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> even Komodo, which I greatly respect

[07-Dec-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not happening

[07-Dec-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we can help each other. Komodo devs help Verus, Verus helps Komodo. A rising tide lifts all boats, but it is an ecosystem, and I'm doing Verus Coin

[07-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Thank you for youre efforts too ..

[07-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thank you üòÉ

[07-Dec-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Good announcement, @miketout ! Of course things will change moving forward, but as of right now I think it was the right call to make. g2g to work.

[07-Dec-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> I have a weird question about forking due to high hash devices (ASICS fpgas etc) if they gain enough hash quickly enough can‚Äôt they basically prevent the fork because they have the most hash? Or it ends up like BSV vs ABC?

[07-Dec-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> With an actual fork that loses value on both sides?

[07-Dec-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Yes ... but in this case its a small group of people. you need the buying power for the coins on the fork. SV has big big money behind it, which is why its working out for them.

[07-Dec-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> And the fork without a dev team is basically useless.

[07-Dec-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> Ok. I thought so but just hadn‚Äôt confirmed my thoughts

[07-Dec-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> @zpajk good point

[07-Dec-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Forking verus without Mike would be a pretty poor plan üòÉ

[07-Dec-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> Although I‚Äôm kind of a ‚Äúthe rule of the code is the rule‚Äù guy, and I don‚Äôt like seeing constant forks. Improvement is good, but not a constant battle. Kind of evolution vs revolution

[07-Dec-18 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> I've stated my opinion on it ... but in the end its mikes desision... Maybe only one fork is required . In that case its probably fine, but just making a better FPGA that is open source is the best plan of action, and then everyone can constantly imporve it. Trying to make the coin CPU and GPU only is a fools errand.

[07-Dec-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks @zpajk

[07-Dec-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Cam [safe.trade] actually, Verus Proof of Power is immune to 51% hash attacks, and then there is dPoW. i suspect they go to other coins for a while, but we will see

[07-Dec-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> I am sure Mike and his team will solve this problem, our task is to support him

[07-Dec-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I would think Verus needs to grow a bigger community of "invested" users in this early stage, and therefore taking miners as example. You're more likely to gather more users as CPU/GPU miners at this point, because FPGAs aren't readily available to a large number of people. If there's not a plan where they all co-exist you'll end up with only a few FPGAs, disencouraging CPU/GPU. Moving forward with larger exchanges and what not, we'll surely be seeing other invested users but as traders/holders/staking, which may render this predicament obsolete.

[07-Dec-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @blackjok3r i agree with you on the open hardware transition, but i'm not convinced it's a fools errand. i think our approach has a lot of reasons it could work, and we could also have open hardware that is faster without knocking out casual mining completely. we'll see on that too. if we achieve it, i would see no reason to fork again for the algorithm

[07-Dec-18 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @zpajk You forget about the large community of POS miners who stay with Verus for a long time. POS is available to everyone, and it is wonderful that Verus cannot be completely controlled by a narrow circle of people. Fork at which there will be an advantage for the CPU miners will add more decentralization

[07-Dec-18 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Didn't forget, I meant POS-investors will be increased with the latter part; by finding investors/stakers through bigger exchanges.

[07-Dec-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> exactly

[07-Dec-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Not of course simple math. Exchanges don't necessarily equal more investors, that has to do with marketing, but still.

[07-Dec-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @Emmanuel he continues to attack the project and the devs on twitter and in the FPGA discord.
