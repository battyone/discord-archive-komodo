[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> 50% POS plus dPOW, I'm not concerned about the security side as would otherwise be the case

[05-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is FUD, plain and simple, and it claims there is a problem, when that is not the issue. he's burning resources and costing the community time better spent solving issues. he's the definition of a troll at this point

[05-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is a LIE to say the network has "been taken over"

[05-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> the cost of entry to POW mine Verus pre-FPGA was a low bar

[05-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> total bullshit

[05-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that implies some security issue, and he knows it

[05-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> this is not about me. this is about him lying to harm the project

[05-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> do FPGA miners make up more than half of the pow portion of verus

[05-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> the answer is yes

[05-Dec-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> for about $300-$400, you could get over 1GH between a 1700x and a GPU

[05-Dec-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> now, there is no point

[05-Dec-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is no way you can say they have taken over the network, and that is what he is implying. if you think this is good for the community or project in any way, please explain how

[05-Dec-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> they have taken over the pow portion

[05-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I think with any project, FPGAs are inevitable. But the method of discussing this seems inappropriate and bad for the community

[05-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> exactly

[05-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> BS, and a malefactor of the community

[05-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> they have taken over the pow portion of verus, how is that inaccurate?

[05-Dec-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> sure, it's a bit misleading because it leaves out POS

[05-Dec-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> sorry @bishop it's strange for someone in the community to be an apologist for this

[05-Dec-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So how is it contructive, for a dev in the same ecosystem, to come in here and make a private disagreement public---and then go on Twitter and talk shit? This is childish ass shit... God damn

[05-Dec-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> no one who has an interest in Verus doing well would do or support such obvious spreading of FUD

[05-Dec-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> so if it was revised to specify the pow portion it would still be FUD?

[05-Dec-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i am not going to engage, but it wouldn't be hard

[05-Dec-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm not trying to argue for or against, the statements... 
I'm saying just what has happened, is some silly shit.. 
Is it not?

[05-Dec-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You can't do this is your Professional workplace...
Wtf is this

[05-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> causing fear, uncertainty, and doubt @bishop

[05-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> again, if it was clarified to be the pow portion, how is it remotely FUD?

[05-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm not even going to have the discussion. as @Badfish said, this approach is childish, attention seeking, and harmful to people making progress. i'm stepping off for a bit until more sense is conveyed. this is a lowly troll effort to smear, nothing else.

[05-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Thats exactly what the tweet is doing

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> maybe I am missing what the big deal is about the twitter post. It lacks some clarity, but completely accurate for the pow side of things

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Badfish He's entitled to his own opinion.

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> That part is true

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> But its not constructuive

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> if there is more, I probably missed it

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> for the communityt

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop   Hey, you're right. Now what?

[05-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> maybe people should go spread panic about every issue that every project has under control. it's strange to understand where you might be coming from @bishop

[05-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Let's lay it all out... What gives @bishop

[05-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's strange you seem so against hearing community members voicing their issue with with FPGAs on the network

[05-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> is it not a community coin?

[05-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> do none of the users have any input?

[05-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have two options, which is more than most coins would have for good reason. i'm going to take a break for a few

[05-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Of course the users has input ...

[05-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why go about it like this?

[05-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This came off more as an attack

[05-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I think you're reading way too much into it

[05-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> again, this is in reference to the tweet I saw

[05-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishopAnd that's it?

[05-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop your argument seems intentionally naive and possibly dishonest. i'm taking a break

[05-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> oh god, so now I'm fuding, christ mike

[05-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He just said he's taking a break

[05-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Take a breather guys

[05-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> do you not see how that tweet has no positive and is only harmful to every single person who actually has an interest in the right thing happening?

[05-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> perhaps many aren't in discord and are aware of what is going on

[05-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> come to think of it, no updates have been provided on BCT

[05-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you seem to argue that it is defensible as something good

[05-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> letting users or potential users aware of the current situation?

[05-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Here in the announcements?

[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> not everyone is in discord

[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He wrote a lengthy description

[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> people should be aware to know

[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's the only outlet for Verus

[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> BCT, the official twitter, etc?

[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> We aren't on Telegram

[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i have been working on the agreement. there is no secret about the value of mining on any device, and there is no emergency or security issue. spreading unknowns when we will know quite soon is basically spreading exactly fear, uncertainty, and doubt. how does it help?

[05-Dec-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Neither have been updated to show what is going on in the community around this issue

[05-Dec-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they are not even on the network right now, and may not be until we actually have a reason to be quite excited about the future. i'd get much further without people who are supposed to be devs on other coins trolling Verus and me

[05-Dec-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> They will be back when their hosting is back online on the 6th

[05-Dec-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> then you will see the nethash 25-30TH again

[05-Dec-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Honestly, you should update both bitcointalk and your official twitter about what is going on so people or prospective users are aware

[05-Dec-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> that's all

[05-Dec-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and we are talking to them and should be working on that, which is how we might get something good out of this for the community, not dealing with trolls trying to harm communication and decisionmaking

[05-Dec-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> discord is only one outlet

[05-Dec-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Does every project do this?

[05-Dec-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Write an official update about every situation they encounter? You are mad

[05-Dec-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I would say this is a large enough situation to warrant in update on all forms of media

[05-Dec-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What are you getting, by doing this?

[05-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> A potential fork and weighing options should be put out there on all forums

[05-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm not saying every little issue needs to be uniform across media

[05-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> but a fork is

[05-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> What does any troll gain?

[05-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I really hope I'm not being lumped into the troll category for voicing an opinion about keeping the community informed

[05-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> BS. it's communications 101, if you spread uncertainty, you spread FUD. we have things to say soon. nothing we say now helps anyone because they can do nothing until there are the options in front of us

[05-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> All I know that there is more behind this, than can be seen at this moment

[05-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> A small update about the situation would have been welcomed to see on both twitter and BCT

[05-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why haven't you mentioned this before Duke did all of this?

[05-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> unfortunately, Duke already did that for you

[05-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I didnt really see any update to be had

[05-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> There is no imminent fork

[05-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> It will have to in some shape

[05-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> unless it is decided that CPU and GPU miners don't matter

[05-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> which is fine if that is what the ultimate community decision is

[05-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why haven't you mentioned this before Duke did all of this? @bishop

[05-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> he attempted to harm the project, nothing more, and that should be recognize, IMO, just as we recognize when people contribute.

[05-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> try 10 hours ago @Cruz

[05-Dec-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Let me ask this Bishop...Is the point to profit? or a quality, usefull project?

[05-Dec-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I think a major selling point to verus is CPU and GPUs being on near level playing fields

[05-Dec-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Really? Okay

[05-Dec-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I cannot think of another coin that can say that

[05-Dec-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes. we should make an update now, but that is just more make work, courtesy of Duke that only helps calm people he may have scared into realizing he spread incomplete, sensationalized FUD, not useful information
