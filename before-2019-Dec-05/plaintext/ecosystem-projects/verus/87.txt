[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> But whatever, horse to water and all that

[19-Dec-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman No, its practically not the same opinion. As a lead dev of a crypto, he understands that change is inevitable. And he is consistent, with his words.
You are in both discords, telling each person they are the greatest in the world. This FPGA conversation, for the Verus project, has been really the first serious issue for the community & the project to encounter together. To be fair to everyone else, bc they have an opinion to voice to, you should state your honest opinion & then chime in, when it's suitable.  Not try to seek attention, here or there.

[19-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm not questioning you being a part of the community or having an opinion, as important as the next persons. I'm only saying to be honest & to be consistent, in what you say. I've been to the FPGA discord. I even checked out all the prices & the results. Why? For general knowledge, I was curious.

[19-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have never changed my opinion for 4 months on fpga mining.

[19-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> show me where i give two opposing views

[19-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I don't need to. I think you know you've been in both discords, telling each one how good they are. Come on.

[19-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> People have commented on you being on both sides, this entire FPGA discussion. Weeks probably

[19-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have been on both discords expressing the same opinion. They say I am trolling to help you guys out and you say I'm causing fud and trying to be on the side of fpga miners. Its hysteria. None of you can show me a expressing two opposing views

[19-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Its mass hysteria. There is not a single quite showing me saying something contradictory.

[19-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You just said it. It's not mass hysteria. It's obviously your actions

[19-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Ok, smart people can work it out for themselves, but if you have zero evidence of me lying or playing both sides, then I'm going to ignore you. Do what you want. I'm fine with that

[19-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's not just me

[19-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> A lot of people have expressed their frustration with you

[19-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Have they not?

[19-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Are you not apologizing every other day, for something?

[19-Dec-18 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm ignoring all people that make accusations with out evidence or validity from now on. Do what you want.

[19-Dec-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> The tone in this discord has changed drastically since the fpga announcement, and considering every time I come on here(which is far less frequently now) it's full of misinformation from the same person posting more than anyone else. Sold out asap, but somehow keeps making demands. Spreading FUD. It's old. It's tiresome.

[19-Dec-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FGPA miners are largely ROI chasers. GPU and CPU miners usually mine in projects they like and are more likely to hold. This is based on what i heard in their discord. Also, price dropped 66% over the course of FPGA miners taking off.
@Honey I cant afford one this soon buddy, but let me know when there is another promotion.

[19-Dec-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> There are two of your opinions

[19-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> On the first page I clicked on the discord... you are everywhere

[19-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "GlorymanToday at 5:22 PM
I'm ignoring all people that make accusations with out evidence or validity from now on. Do what you want."

You mean like this:

[19-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You want to buy one when there's another promotion. But you are seeking praise with your Anti-FPGA statement

[19-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz Thanks for showing something as this allows me to explain. I've said on this forum for months that I wanted to get an FPGA and I still do. I have never contradicted this. @Patrick ManBearPig What was wrong on inaccurate about what i said. That is my honest opinion, then and now.

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why should we even know, if you want to buy one?

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I don't. But you are so loud

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Knows so little, speaks so much.

[19-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Be a community member like everyone else. No quieter, no louder

[19-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz lol, people talk about a lot of different mining developments on this discord. One of the miner developers for Verus was talking about FPGAs because it is relevant to the VERUS project.

[19-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz some people talk less, some people talk more. This is part of life.

[19-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> When we have been trying to have serious conversations, here you are piping in, or apologizing.

[19-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Why do you keep putting yourself in the same breath as developers?

[19-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You keep dropping names, but have you contributed anything? Serious question.

[19-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lol the difference between me and Mike, is a difference I wish not to look into ....

[19-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz I dont understand.

[19-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Cruz lol, when i say FPGA miners are not evil but they at this time they damage the project you say I'm playing both sides. Then when mike says they are coin sniping but wants to work with them to equalise then its 'great work'. This is practically the same opinion. joy

[19-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> whats wrong with that?

[19-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Mike can say freely what he wants to. He has good reasoning. Why compare yourself to Mike? lol

[19-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> His work is great, yeah

[19-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Where's your work?

[19-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hahahhahaha. Some people can have a similar opinion on things. Even if one is talented.

[19-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> And some people are just a spectator at a movie, but they didn't even buy a ticket to the cheapest matinee they just snuck in past the booth

[19-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Lets all chill and drop it

[19-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Me and Warren Buffet have similar opinions. 
But his are valid, my aren't ‚Öõ valid as his.

[19-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> My opinion is 'coin sniping' damaging and 'equalising' is good.

[19-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Your opinion changes from day to day, discord to discord

[19-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Unless it benefits a threadripper of course

[19-Dec-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Then lets go with that option

[19-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Mining Spec the few days delay on everything was because of Windows and the C++ compiler not supporting some standard things I used for the new algo. that has been sorted out, and we are hoping for a release today. testing in progress.

[19-Dec-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @p1nklemon that was a birthday present from my brother üòÉ I can ask him where he bought them, if you'd like.
@ver_User been working non-stop for the past few days on a Windows, MingW64 bug (the build environment) that affects mining in Windows and I am working on working around right now. As of yesterday, we know that it cannot be trivially worked around, and I will do whatever I need to today, so we can get it out.

[20-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @miketout thank you for the hard work!

[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> When is the new algo being implemented? I had heard Sunday but curious if that is still on track. Thanks

[20-Dec-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are planning to fork on block 310000, which is Dec 28th. releases are being prepared today.

[20-Dec-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> new algo has been implemented for a little while now. we have been tracking down and then working around a thread local storage bug in MingW/gcc compiler for the windows build. the first release includes portable support as well, since that was done as we were looking for the windows issue.

[21-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VirtualSoundNW> Always best to fork on a fixed block height for this sort of thing so everybody has a weeklong window to get upgraded.
