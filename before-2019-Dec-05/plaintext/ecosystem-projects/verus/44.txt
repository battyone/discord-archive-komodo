[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> in the coins settings, in the Details tab, you have two buttuns directly below the price.  The button on the left is how you select the Exchange, you should see DigitalPrice in there.

[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> thanks @ok88  thats what i thought

[26-Oct-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @ok88 lol for u it might be very lite. but for a small minner it is big thing bro.... vrsc should focus on high hash rate from one guy

[26-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> there should be machnism to block such high hash

[26-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> then all small miners will leave this coin soon

[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> My friend also mining Verus said there was a hashrate spike to 400Th last night? And I see a spike to 63 on versuspool. Thoughts on that?

[26-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @2Faze that's not the latest version

[26-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Thats the only exchange i can choose and trading pair only kmd is available

[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Update to their 2.0 on the appstore

[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> I just updated it

[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> i feel there is big inside mining going on

[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that's not the right UI

[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that's the old one looks like

[26-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> somehow verus is compromised with high mining hash power

[26-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> no point vrsc moving to verushash.... this coin can be on the same equihash

[26-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> all the hash power centralised with couple of guys

[26-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> there is no decentralisation here

[26-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @etrnlgldnbraid those are invalid/fake shares with efficiency=0 most likely

[26-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> pointing the wrong miners to the wrong port, something like that

[26-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> what about this

[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> 100s of rigs

[26-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Interesting

[26-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> people who run their own private pools

[26-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @dukeleto that is veuspool.io

[26-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> not private pool

[26-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you don't comprendo

[26-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> if u dnt know, please check above

[26-Oct-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> a private pool of hundreds/thousands of machines, that pool resources together, finally send hashrate to a public pool

[26-Oct-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> miners -> private pool -> public pool

[26-Oct-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I am saying this as one plausible explanation. I don't know anything for sure, except ASICs for verushash most likely don't exist

[26-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> I didnt see myself, but my friend said he saw 400 Th as the total network hash listed on veruspool

[26-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> much much more likely and profitable for some smart sysadmin to be using 1000 servers that sit idle all the time somewhere

[26-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> mining pools and explorers are riddled with display bugs, as well, they aren't perfect

[26-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> just because you see a graph on a webpage, doesn't make it real 😃

[26-Oct-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if i was that person, i would have them pointed locally, a private pool

[26-Oct-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> then those private pools send hashrate to a public pool, as one worker

[26-Oct-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they look like one unit, but it's actually hundreds or thousands of machines

[26-Oct-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @dukeleto i used to get 30 vrsc after rewards reduction, but since 3 days iam getting 8vrsc

[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @damodar i used to get 384 blocks very often 😹

[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Exactly @dukeleto

[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> For sure, I asked him if he saw it listed elsewhere but he didnt check multiple sources. But coinciding with the spike to 60+ TH on veruspool seems ominous

[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> hashrate has gone up considerably, almost 10x, in the last few days

[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @dukeleto now i came to know, u will be one of the person among these person

[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if you keep the same hardware, your hashrate is constant, which means diminishing rewards

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Could be also due to the updated ccminer

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's basic math

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> It outperforms Agama

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> lololol

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> thats the reason u are strongly supporting these kind of centralisation

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> ccminer is 70% faster, on my machines, than CLI verus. Agama is slower due to using more CPU for GUI stuff

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> yup

[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> but that doesn't explain these large workers

[26-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> these large workers are private pools

[26-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> no, that is true

[26-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> i think the 17TH is real with no asics. if every cpu gpu makes ~ 500MH its 34k units

[26-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they take the hashrate of 1000 machines and make it look like a single working in a public pool

[26-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's more efficient that way, better for the miner. just makes sense

[26-Oct-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> why have 10,000 computers going over the public internet to tell a mining pool server something, when instead, they can all talk on blazing fast local network and only 1 or a few machines send data to the public pool

[26-Oct-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> makes it much less visible in network stats, too 😹

[26-Oct-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> this guy @dukeleto giving his schooling maths n puzzles.... he is big hasher as i mentioned above.

[26-Oct-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> maybe one day, but I am an old skool miner you could say

[26-Oct-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I only haz 1 GH/s currently, those big miners are not me

[26-Oct-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> but they are easily explained by private pools on university/company networks

[26-Oct-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> many CPUs can do ~1 GH/s, that is 17000 machines to get 17 TH/s. law schools would be perfect, they always have the very best computers

[26-Oct-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> each working is smaller tho, 400 GH/s worker could be 800 500 MH/s computers

[26-Oct-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> How do I do that at my work without anyone knowing 😂

[26-Oct-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> machines that are on the same physical LANs make sense to batch together as one worker

[26-Oct-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> only u guys mine this coin, i dnt want mine at lose bro.... let stop mining is gud, instead of giving my hash for no use

[26-Oct-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> every coins are taking by fuckers like high hash power gives, n killing small miners

[26-Oct-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> please, stop mining, the hashrate will go down....

[26-Oct-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> ya u guys can get more coins... such a greedy fucker u are all

[26-Oct-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Higher hashrate means a more secure network, ideally. So its bittersweet. Buy some VRSC instead.

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @etrnlgldnbraid lol yes exactly, its centralised with high hash power guys

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> u know how coin price increases

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @damodar i don't think you understand what centralized means

[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> only with adaption of investors

[26-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> all the coins are resides in few wallets means... no price increase

[26-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> it need to scatter, then only price will increase

[26-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> just learn that

[26-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> if it resides in few wallets , price will get dumped on one day

[26-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Are you complaining about centralized supply or centralized hashrate

[26-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> centralised hashrate

[26-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> I think the hashrate could be more of a concern, if the recent spikes to 60 and 400 TH are somehow real.

[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Unless we assume the Unknown workers here are just one address then it seems pretty decentralized to me

[26-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> i would not assume that page takes into account solo miners correctly

[26-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> But yes we went from 3-4 TH to 16-17 pretty quickly. That does make the network less vulnerable
