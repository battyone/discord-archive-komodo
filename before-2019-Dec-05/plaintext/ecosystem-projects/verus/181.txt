[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but hey, trade where you like to, decentralisation is always a thing.

[14-Jun-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Actually, I just noticed a list and search box on the bottom right. I don't know how I missed it before

[14-Jun-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> because that's nowhere to look for it üòÑ

[14-Jun-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> haha

[14-Jun-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> All exchanges do the same thing

[14-Jun-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Any time I end up back at the default market page, which I think is btc/eth I always just go to my URL bar history to go back to the vrsc market

[14-Jun-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Only ways one exchange is better than another is liquidity & security

[14-Jun-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> They really are the ones that make money here

[14-Jun-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Stex does have a decent mobile app, which is surprising.

[14-Jun-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Only the big exchanges really offer that

[14-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> DP is working again

[14-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Patrick Crypto I suspect that there will be a lot more volume on those CMC exchanges you mentioned once Verus is listed on CMC, just because these CMC exchanges have a lot more users which won¬¥t bother to register on yet another exchange if Verus is available on an exchange that they already use.

[14-Jun-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Agreed

[14-Jun-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Just like with Binance...US traders will be limited

[14-Jun-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> We won't have many options to choose from lol

[14-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> It's fine, we'll have facebook's coin! ü§¢

[15-Jun-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nille> good morning everyone ‚òï

[15-Jun-19 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ahh must be nice to be European

[15-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Morning all. and 10: indeed is is....

[15-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @MrCryptoCash-AcedPoker.io That was what I was waiting for... Ordered right away...

[15-Jun-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think yesterday's Binance news, really showed that US users could benefit greatly from Atomic Swaps, or an OTC platform. But even if that involved KMD or VRSC, I'd see regulations being complied with. Hmmmm.. Tough stuff

[15-Jun-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @MrCryptoCash-AcedPoker.io my tshirt order already shipped? if not i'd like to add a basecap to it if possible.

[15-Jun-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> fully decentralized cross chain atomic swaps appear to be the only type of "exchange" that fits into the exemptions defined by the recent SEC fincen guidelines. there is actually a specific paragraph stating it is exempt

[15-Jun-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Looks like Komodo and Verus are ahead of all exchanges in that respect...

[15-Jun-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, a lot of fake DEX, claiming to be decentralized, but most of those are using a proxy token and then trading onchain the token. so being a DEX for a token, but the real coins are controlled by a single entity. i only know of a few multisig gateways, which might be enough to overcome the custodial burden. but the entire proxy token DEX, it just seems like not enough to fit into the exemption

[15-Jun-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> turns out the decentralization in this case is not just for idealistic reasons

[15-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> fully decentralized cross chain atomic DEX seems the only way to avoid the regulations, likely as the regulators realized it couldnt be regulated anyway

[15-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was just about to say that

[15-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> however, they did even give an exemption to informational sites that displayed status of the atomic DEX, which is something they didnt have to do

[15-Jun-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> they did also say that a dapp that is doing money transmission is subject to regulation, though not sure how they will regulate code on the blockchain

[15-Jun-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> a Dapp is (IMO) a point of entry to the blockchain... Nothing centralized about that.... On the other hand, I can imaging them reasoning a dapp being centrally created / updated / maintained. That would throw us back in the discussion similar to whether the swiping wallets on KMD chain was a centralized action...

[15-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> they seem to model things based on ETH smart contracts that need to be refilled with ETH for gas

[15-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> maybe if you pay for the gas, you are guilty?

[15-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They would basically say that any actions taken by a small independent group of people is centralization

[15-Jun-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the rescuing of the exposed wallets was definitely a centralized action. i decided it was better to sweep the funds rather than allow the hacker to

[15-Jun-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I agreed and I think a lot of the crypto community agreed with that action as well

[15-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it seems to have been covered by good samaritan laws, similar to finding a wallet in the street

[15-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> The alternative was not good, at all

[15-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I don't want to speculate how bad it would have been

[15-Jun-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there isnt time to get permission from the wallet owner, like seeing whose wallet it is, trying to contact them to get permission to take their wallet off the street

[15-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree on that, but I see it as decentralized, because anyone with the skills and deciveness could have initiated it. drastic circumstances require drastic actions, IMO

[15-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and while you are waiting for permission, a kid on a skateboard zooms by and grabs the cash in it, making it very silly to have waited

[15-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and in our case, we have no way of contacting users from an address

[15-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> It makes crypto kind of irrelevant in the real world, when monies like that are allowed to be lost and never recovered.

[15-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> We are all adults and need our funds.

[15-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I thought it was right, for sure

[15-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the hardliners who say the code is law, ignore the reality of unintended bugs

[15-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is definitely new territory and hopefully our actions sets a good precedent for future hack resolutions

[15-Jun-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To talk in a Pirate fashion: They're more like guidelines...

[15-Jun-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ethereum is impractical ...
I say that with respect, for what they do, though.

[15-Jun-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> we did sweep a small amount of VRSC, if you find your coins went to the sweep address, DM me and i will take care of it

[15-Jun-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Their DEX are not really usable.
And decentralization, like they see it, is not functional in the real world

[15-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> That's why I always like Komodo

[15-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Creativity

[15-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> But very practical

[15-Jun-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Komodo is the reason I'm here in the Verus Community today....

[15-Jun-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> here Read this message, **check your wallets to see if you are missing VRSC**!!!

[15-Jun-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> also i have to thank the entire verus community for helping out during this crisis.

[15-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just being good neighbours

[15-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it will end up really raising the visibility of verus too

[15-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Especially with the exposure and gift from Pirate!

[15-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i am really happy that within the komodo ecosystem, the projects are indeed good neighbors!

[15-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> We all know your good spirit and desire to want to improve  the crypto community, as a whole .... you've put in many years in crypto

[15-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if only the entire crypto can behave this way, we would be much farther ahead

[15-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it does feel like one of my years, is 7 normal ones

[15-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Nxt, Bitcoin Dark, Supernet, KMD...
We do appreciate your willingness to talk with the community and be accessible

[15-Jun-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I get it. The progress Komodo is making is only matched by a select few (Of which I think Verus is one)

[15-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there is just so much more to deal with than most people realize, tip of the iceberg effect

[15-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> In what aspect?

[15-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> just that everything is a lot harder than it looks. from the simple getting an exchange listing, to having a website to making releases

[15-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there are attackers throughout the process

[15-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As I have as description in my twitter: *Most people get into Crypto Currency. Some people find out about the Blockchains behind them. Few people realize the potential.*

[15-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> There are always attackers...
My friend showed me some screenshots, from his network at a major corp...lol

[15-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ir√°n, Russia all of these people trying to get in

[15-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> all day

[15-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, whereever there is money, there are attackers

[15-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> one hacker targets websites of projects doing ICO/IEO. takes it down with ddos or whatever to blackmail them for BTC

[15-Jun-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They know they can get away with it... Small ~~change~~ chance to be brought to justice, big rewards...

[15-Jun-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Lol..I can't stand exchanges, guys ..
I've really never liked them, tbh.
They get a lot of money, for doing one thing.

[15-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> They get too much importance placed on their role

[15-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @jl777c KMD ever going to run an ICO again?

[15-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They'll fade into history once real decentralized trading picks up, especially after the SEC exemption...

[15-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I knew I liked you  @Oink

[15-Jun-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> For now, we need them, but future will tell if that'll change

[15-Jun-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Man I can't say enough how nice it is, to have guys like Mike & JL, present in their communities...

[15-Jun-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> thre's no point discussing if hacking the hacker made sense; not your keys - not your coins; keys leaked = coins public

[15-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ethereum community would probably feel different

[15-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so anyone could take them; team decided to take them and bring back to original users

[15-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> how can anyone not see this as sth good ?

[15-Jun-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Some might not bc it was a centralized action...
But they are impractical and don't care about their users, if they felt that way .. Not a coin I would want to hold

[15-Jun-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I mnot sure if there is such a thing like "Eth community" , in this communities when one can gain a lot of money you got paid troll groups most probably, so who care what such communities produce as thoughts, I got my own üòÉ

[15-Jun-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @10 centralization is good same as decentralization - depends on context, people who dont understand it... well poor people

[15-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if someone believes nothing in crypto can be centralized because it's bad... well he is just wrong

[15-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> this was totally outside the blockchain

[15-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the talk of centralization is totally stupid

[15-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> centralized action would be here when most notaries decides to roll back

[15-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and that was not the case

[15-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> same as CZ said they considered roll back of BTC
