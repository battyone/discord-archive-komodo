[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Something like ‚ÄúLearn more about Verus by watching these videos!‚Äù

[08-May-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti No enlargement of the font. It throws the entire page off balance, unless I enlarge all fonts. But that will result in a grotesque page. I did ditch the word wrap.
@Ginasis Mining Pools Spacing between categories implemented, for consistency applied that to other pages too.

[08-May-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] Thank you. Those suggestions are exactly the sort of things a non-native speaker is looking for.

[08-May-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I‚Äôll look at it some more on my computer in a bit. On mobile right now

[08-May-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm not going anywhere...

[08-May-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> how big is the native wallet?

[08-May-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> About blockchain + zcash params together about 5GB

[08-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> does it save the blockchain data to appdata or programdata?

[08-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> or can it be moved elsewhere

[08-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> App data

[08-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Cannot be moved.

[08-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> yeah not worth it

[08-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> would be nice if you could save it to external storage or another drive

[08-May-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> 5gb is a lot?

[08-May-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> on a ssd yes

[08-May-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, it would... it‚Äôs worth a suggestion to our Agama developer...

[08-May-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i have bitcoin core on external and its about 250GB

[08-May-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ordered 1TB Nvme to stay out of trouble... waiting for it to arrive...

[08-May-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i am probably going to get 2 500GB ssd's and a raid card and set them to raid 0

[08-May-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> a lot cheaper then nvme storage

[08-May-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ehmmm... not a big fan of striping...

[08-May-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> In my main I have 4tb of ssd storage

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I havent used hhds in a while

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i have ~ 500GB ssd storage then about 12TB of external storage

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> redundant storage

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> you can get a 1tb ssd now for $100

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> so how is 5gb a lot? lol

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> love windows storage spaces

[08-May-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> Games > Blockchain data üòâ

[08-May-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> who saves games locally? ha

[08-May-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i do for the speeds

[08-May-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I just download them as needed.  Maybe keep a few local that I play more often

[08-May-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Crypto >>>>>>>>> games

[08-May-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> but yeah it would be nice if the blockchain could be stored externally but i can always  create a symlink to fake it

[08-May-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> whoops off topic

[08-May-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> its general discussion

[08-May-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I meant me.  I get rolling on something and clog things up

[08-May-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I *try* to leave this stictly verus in here

[08-May-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i think thats what i will do just download the wallet then symlink it to external anyways

[08-May-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> whos the agama developer?

[08-May-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mike tout jr

[08-May-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well the Komodo team and verus forked and now maintain their own version üòÉ

[08-May-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Wait... so wallet data on main drive is bad and games on main drive is good? Have I been doing it wrong for the past decade or more?

[08-May-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @zpajk wallet data is better stored on a secure offline if possible device

[08-May-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Only connecting to a more secure machine when you need to use

[08-May-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well that‚Äôs my opinion

[08-May-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn‚Äôt dare any sensible comments after he mentioned raid-0

[08-May-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> üòõ

[08-May-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Thought it would be obvious without a trollface, but maybe not

[08-May-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> xD

[08-May-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> you dont need blockchain data to secure your actual wallet the dat file is actually your wallet üòõ

[08-May-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> that's why a lot of people grab the bootstrap to save time

[08-May-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> verus though is probably different

[08-May-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You don‚Äôt need blockchain to secure, only to access...

[08-May-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i meant bootstrap

[08-May-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> %appdata%\Komodo\VRSC\wallet.dat

[08-May-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> is your actual wallet

[08-May-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> %appdata%\Komodo\VRSC\blocks is the blockchain

[08-May-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Your point being?

[08-May-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i thought someone said you need blockchain to have your data secured which is not true just the wallet.dat

[08-May-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Backing up / securing wallet.dat is enough...

[08-May-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Read the pinned message in #community-support . It‚Äôs not exactly this subject, but it covers the details

[08-May-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i know that...

[08-May-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> your acting like im looking for help lol

[08-May-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don‚Äôt understand why you supply us with this information, that‚Äôs why... often people don‚Äôt know what they want or what to ask for.

[08-May-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> found a bootstrap üòÑ

[08-May-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz

[08-May-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> hmmm, wasn't that mentioned in the pinned message I reffered you to earlier? You know, the one with the info you already knew?

[09-May-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> Huh?

[09-May-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> I wasn't looking for it just found it

[09-May-19 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Codeman That¬¥s @0x03 bootstrap, works very nice and can be trusted - use it myself all the time üòÉ

[09-May-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> On Linux I just unpack it directly into .komodo/VRSC/

[09-May-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> $ cd ~/.komodo/VRSC
$ wget -qO- wget https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz | tar xvz

[dscrdvrsc] <bubu> good morning everyone

[09-May-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Morning

[09-May-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> awfully quiet around here lately

[09-May-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Everything alright @miketout ?

[09-May-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> doesnt seem that quiet to me

[09-May-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Hollowman9000 Think he¬¥s working on a PBaaS upgrade since May 2nd, see his msg in #pbaas-development

[09-May-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!

[09-May-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Better?

[09-May-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But I feel like things have been picking up lately. Nice to see solid progress in the PBaaS testnet and even better to get hands on with it

[09-May-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Seems the project is developing at good pace... Going to be well exciting when it takes off

[09-May-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz shouldn‚Äôt Rabble been done in #off-topic ... üòÇ jk

[09-May-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Felt it pertinent at the time but you might have me there  @Oink.  üòÜ

[09-May-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But it‚Äôs been a bit quiet today here, all the action was in #off-topic , I suppose...

[09-May-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 everything is good. I did have some not fun dental work the other day, but I've been 100% heads down on the next rev of PBaaS for testnet. except for that interruption, i've been hoping to get an update out for people with some cool new capabilities and improvements any day. as a meta goal, i'm really just focused on getting finished with the full PBaaS upgrade for mainnet, which includes PBaaS, merge mining, auto-notarization for cross chain transactions, and full fractional reserve liquidity support with a solution to front-running. As soon as I finish with the next PBaaS testnet upgrade, I'm going to go for finishing the whole thing with reserves and hardening. People across the community should discuss what PBaaS can actually do, and it would probably be best for the project during this stretch for more people to try it out, learn how it works, and share what it is. The last testnet has been a little taste, and we got good test value. This should be more fun, and I really hope people try it out by making their own blockchains, merge mining, and notarizing other chains even to get rewards. On the liquidity piece, which will be part of the protocol for fractional reserve chains, and will open up an incredible number of use cases, you can checkout an article I came across recently that explains it pretty well. Instead of tokens, it will be full coins on a blockchain of their own with Verus as the reserve. Instead of a fixed reserve percentage, reserves will be modifiable down through reward emission and up through staking of the blockchain reserves, which can also pay for services: https://hackernoon.com/how-liquid-tokens-work-a4ba30f2482b?fbclid=IwAR3_PkeD6bW8QEfQ4bQ1uqajWeJQOuoDE9iouSsckq9B8-tJ7Elz0wm27GA

[09-May-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would mean that autochains will be able to influence their slippage, if they can vary the reserve...

[09-May-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Thanks for the update @miketout 

Dental work makes me cringe, ‚Äúyou must have an auxiliary nerve that the numbing agent didn‚Äôt get to‚Äù

[09-May-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Not much consolation

[09-May-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And soon anyone can easily create their own fully flexible projects. The process of blockchain creation finally automated.  That is the progress everyone, both inside and out of this project has been waiting for

[09-May-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So exciting. All those capabilities and the security too
