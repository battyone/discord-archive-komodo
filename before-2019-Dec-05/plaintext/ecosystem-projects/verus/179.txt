[dscrdvrsc] <10> don't do that

[12-Jun-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Do you know how much longer we are at 24/blocks for staking?

[dscrdvrsc] <10> p @Oink Verus rich list?

[12-Jun-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I believe another 17-18 months

[12-Jun-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Rich list.... Wait... I'll shift some funds around first... Whoehahahha

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not really up-to-date, though.... The balance shown for my address is a couple of days old

[12-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.services/richlist> Any difference, @Oink ?

[12-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Lemme check...

[12-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Can‚Äôt see.. I‚Äôm not in top 100... somewhere between 200-300...

[12-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But it‚Äôs completely different from dexstats, so I think this one is more reliable...

[12-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since it‚Äôs an 0x03 production, I‚Äôll even bet on it... ü§£

[12-Jun-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> D‚Äôoh! Clearly states Top 100, but I didn‚Äôt look.

 @Thoskk thx

[12-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> What do you think the average amount a verus holder has?  Been in this about a year but new comers now it seems to be hard to accumulate.

[12-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> A year is like damn near from the beginning

[12-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I'll take a guess for fun..

[12-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> If u got in first week, 60k to 100k...
August, 40k-60k
December 12.5k to 39k
January on.. 50 to 12k

[12-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> That is just an estimate, I came up with, and was for fun...

[12-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> It isn't backed up by any statistical data

[12-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> @10 well that is accurate for me at least

[12-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> Not even close. I have just under 10k. I got in as the 300 blocks were ending. I only got one of them. I also was just mining on 1 computer for a long time.

[12-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> TBH, it just shows that you will get somewhere if u just stick with it

[12-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @gamer278 That's killer... 10k

[12-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dŒõtmox> 10k with mining only? lucky you i guess üòõ

[12-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> After being around other crypto communities for the last few days it‚Äôs so refreshing to come back here and see how professionally everything is done... Can‚Äôt help but feel this project will go on to great things

[12-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> @dŒõtmox and staking

[12-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> Almost half my coins are still locked up though.

[12-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> To have hundreds or thousands of a coin like Verus, with it's low supply and future potential, is very promising

[12-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Or even just 25 or 50

[12-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I'd rather have 2k Verus than 1 Eth

[12-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Price isn't everything

[12-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> If all cryptos fell back to 0, you know what they have to offer? Tech

[12-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Is arrr coins related to vrsc

[12-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> related in the fact they are within the komodo ecosystem.

[12-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> other than that, No

[12-Jun-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Well yeah, we do both kick a**

[12-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @hin5584 VRSC and PIRATE are as independent blockchains as BTC and LTC are independent to each other.

[12-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Ic

[12-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Only sharing Komodo

[12-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Komodo is the executable binary used for both to run these chains.

[12-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> That's the common thing from everyday user's point of view.

[12-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Are they good?

[12-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> If more technical is hard to understand.

[12-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Good as in? You have to understand why they are different and have to make sense of them yourself to decide if they are good.

[12-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> PIRATE is all privacy transactions.

[12-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Similar to zcash?

[12-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> VRSC is Blockchains as a Service and more securer superior consensus also.

[12-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you can see PIRATE is exactly what Zcash is, just without any transparent transactions in it.

[12-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> So, it's much more **better** on user's transaction's privacy.

[12-Jun-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Wow

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Love the kmd community kindness. Really cool of both Pirate and Verus. These guys lead by a good example and set the new standard by proving that we all benefit when we support each other, rather than the tired old model of secrecy and selfishness. Open source and let the people decide what's best. If you fear this, chances are you weren't creating or adding much anyhow.. but really love the back and forth of helping out that I keep seeing, both from developers but also across communities.  Truly something special. üëå üòé

Hi. I'm having a problem with the Verus Agama (6.0-13 pbaas) for windows (10). It refuses to shutdown when native mode is used. It stays on the "please wait" window indefinitely, until I force close the agama process chain. I am not sure if this can damage something. Last time I force closed it, it seems to have corrupted part of the local KMD chain, as it had to resync part it already synched before.

[13-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Yes @Crupti and @Oink - Graviex is a CMC listed exchange. üòú

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Also they have a faucet which is a good idea to use.  We‚Äôve had a few new users because of it and it sparks trading activity.
