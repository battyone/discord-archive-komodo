[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Are you on Agama v0.3.13c?

[04-Oct-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> yeah

[04-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> If full wipe of VRSC data and resync from bootstrap won't help, we have probably a wallet problem.

[04-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> the wallet is actually on a clean instal

[04-Oct-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> did you try to backup it and salvage? ./verusd -salvagewallet

[04-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> might be a duplicate as well

[04-Oct-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @cryptoprofit.zone you said you were new here- how new? Were you able to stake a block correctly or solo mine one yet? Figured I'd ask the obvious first- whether you got the coins from pool mining or if you have a very large Supply already and was able to stake blocks

[04-Oct-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @cryptoprofit.zone what do you mean by wallet being a clean install?

[04-Oct-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What's up ok88 hope the mining is going well

[04-Oct-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Godballz cheers, all goodie üëç Mining with gpu rigs and having a ton of fun with it

[04-Oct-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> i actually forgot i had mined these coins when the rewards were high and found the .dat file  backed up on a usb having just reimaged my pc i installed the new wallet copied in the dat fille and now having these problems i know a few on the coins are unshielded as i have been mining recently via a pool from memory i did shield a few that had matured before reinstalling the wallet if that helps also i notice that i have some R adresses and also some b adresses containing coins if that helps

[04-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> So agama display the coins as transparent balance or not?

[04-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @cryptoprofit.zone you probably already know this but coins gained from pool mining have already been shielded and don't need to be again. When you mind the coins when the rewards were high do you know how much the block was worth? Could they be time locked? A lot of the earliest block rewards were time locked.

[04-Oct-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That good to hear ok88, same deal here. Digging the project

[04-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> So staking rewards need to be shielded to stake?

[04-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Knew that was a thing with the timelocked coins

[04-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Not <=96 staking/mining rewards

[04-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Hollowman9000 Yes, staked coins need to be shielded for sure

[04-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Thought that was just part of the script addresses of the timelocked rewards

[04-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @miketout

[04-Oct-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 all coinbases need to be shielded as part of the original Zcash protocol. that includes normal, smaller coinbases from both staking and mining.
@cryptoprofit.zone#5528 if you're not out of sync, you won't need to delete and resync. if you have the keys for the coins, it should be solvable. based on what you've said, it does seem that there is a likely issue of shielding/unshielding, but feel free to DM me for help. i'm deep in code/test/debug right now, but I will check in periodically

[04-Oct-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> So a mining/staking reward can be sent to a z address, and sent right back to the original address and then be valid for staking?

[04-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I won‚Äôt @ you, but thanks for the time mike

[04-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> _will no longer interrupt_

[04-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> 'right back' wont work, it'll take a bunch

[04-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> but basically, yes

[04-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> you'd `z_shieldcoinbase` your coinbases (mining/staking rewards) and then `z_sendmany` back to one of your addresses.

[04-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> but it's only coinbases, the payouts from pool aren't coinbases, these are just normal transactions

[04-Oct-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Yes, just solo mined/staked blocks need shielding, pool shield the rewards for the users before sending (I guess? üòÉ ). If you run Agama in GUI, shielding is really easy with the "Shield all recent coinbase transactions" option and I recommend it for users that dislike putting cli commands up, it's really two mouseclicks.

[04-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> yea, the NOMP pools do the `z_shieldcoinbase` automagically after they find blocks. otherwise no payouts were possible.

[04-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @cryptoprofit.zone The correct Agama response is like that, so I think you really would need mike's help or other very early adopter to get your wallet working üëç It probably needs a kind of fix to be easily available for current Agama.

[04-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> does the GUI allow shielding single coinbases?

[04-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> or is there only a 'shield all' option?

[04-Oct-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Shield all is default, there is a dropdown so I guess one might chose some specific coinbase? üòÆ I never had to shield some separately so it's a wild guess, but a dropdown suggest that its there for it üòÑ

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What was up with that Reddit post? I'm surprised that there are people that feel that way. On one hand, I somewhat see their point but it's completely negated by the fact that verus brings a lot with it to the table and are close with the kmd devs. That was one inconsolable dude

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Some people , all they want in life is there piece of the pie, no thoughts about changing the world for the better, 
only ‚Äú how much you gonna pay me ! ‚Äú .
that fella should grow up , join in with the rest of us helping to change the world , 
and take a chill pill.
He‚Äôs welcome to come here and mine verus with the rest of us , its still early days yet , he‚Äôs not missed out , earn some vrsc the same way we all have, by getting involved in this project and supporting an idea that can better the whole population of our planet , we are contributing to the future ,here 
and in most other block chain projects running today ,the idea of taking power back. I agree that there are scammers and greedy people out there giving crypto projects a bad name everywhere, 
even in other crypto discords.
But this idea / project that we are involved in is in no way a sh*t coin or a scam ,
Its a game changer , 
Im proud to think that I am part of this ,
also thankful and humbled for the previous and current work that has been done by the KOMODO team and its community , 
i hope we can all contribute towards this brighter future, together, 
For the new generations of people to come, after we have left this world,( like our children and grandchildren ),
Until then we can make some crypto profits along the way, the fair way , by contributing to the block chains. üí°‚õì‚öñÔ∏è‚õèüåéüåçüåèüí™

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yep, don‚Äôt get me wrong i know some people think blockchains was made for people to get rich on crypto, thats fine but i believe block chains and crypto was made to free people from all the corruptions in the world and make us  all equal , not dependant on the ruling class ,if you like .

[05-Oct-18 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> People can get more wealthy along the way , if it doesn‚Äôt impact others  equality . 
Rich and powerful people are just the same as me and all of us but the system that we are all forced to use is there system , and block chains and cryptos are an evolution in technology  and society that can fix the system by creating a new one , and we are all taking part in that change , i fully support that idea and will do my best to encourage others to help along the way , solidarity will bring that change for us all that bit faster .

[05-Oct-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm totally with you I just wish that the institutions governing these new technologies would lay off and form new committees rather than using one's set up in the 1930s. They are trying to take new technologies and explain them to old set in their ways closed minded people. With the blockchain and all this crap about net neutrality there really should be a new technology division formed. Why is it that we are all such unoriginal bastards that are afraid to pave new paths? We have to try to take new stuff and try to fit it in an ancient box. Old and out of touch people who don't have any idea on what technology even is should not decide the fate of the masses on subjects they don't even understand. A new organization can be built from developers and tech savvy people for developers and tech savvy people. Instead of bickering on which old conformity they can shove blockchain into perhaps the discussion should be about forming a new one altogether of educated people who have a real interest in this field

[06-Oct-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @GlorymanRTS I believe we are in accumulation phrase with price being in sideways advancement, you need to adjusts both the chart and coin supply rewards knowledge to understand that. It is good we have supply increase while moving sideways, really good price action for the project to not be supply driven.

[06-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @GlorymanRTS to ease the picture, please be aware that coins bought in Jul have staked a lot of coins for its holders, way more than ones you would aquire now did. The staked blocks were having more coins in it and the staking supply was way lower than now. That justifies the price action we had. If we are moving sideways while holders are acquiring more coins with staking, that means that demand is constantly rising, because it meets the constantly increasing supply. As long as price is the same, VRSC holders are gaining value because they stake more coins, so their portfolio value increases in BTC terms and VRSC terms. As long as we are having sideways price action we are actually gaining higher value of the project itself because basically its real market cap increases due to constantly rising supply ü§û

[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @GlorymanRTS you are not wrong in principle, it has gone down since the listing. It also went up since the low at 0.0000099 - all depends on your framing ;)

there is so much wrong with using that chart like that without context. 

currently we are basically flatlining around 2, although creeping up a little. If the project demonstrates incremental successes and there is a good reception and uptake on cryptopia, then this should be a price floor. If not, honestly I don't know how low a bearish alt can go apart from 0. I don't want to make any guesses as I'm less familiar with early alt price behaviour, but I am generally thinking it'll take some months before we get readable/tradeable market moves. At the moment it's all about your preference, risk tolerance and personal intepretation of VRSC value. Personally I never like trend following as a starting point, so if one thinks it's bearish, it's time to consider buying IMO

[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> other point is that volume is insanely low

[07-Oct-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> so putting much weight into the current market price isn't really a great idea

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I just wondered if it was worth mining for the electricity and maybe buying if it is a good investment

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @ver_User Personally, I'm hodl'ing until we're in the top 100 on CMC - not financial advice though üòâ

[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> wishful thinking will be great if it comes true üòâ

[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> but yeah all or nothing really... start up mentality, why not

[07-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> maybe it would be better to mine elsewhere and invest if it had potential

[07-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I'm not sure on the calculation for mining

[07-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> at the moment

[07-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> depends on your electricity, check the mining thread,  I'm sure it's been talked about

[07-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> for a time the rewards for mining were worth whatver you could throw at it pretty much
