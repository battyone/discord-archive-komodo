[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes. This is apparently a factor. Difficulty will rise fast when these things hit the market. Something I forgot about completely myself.

[15-Feb-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Yes indeed, difficulty will increase along with availability of higher hashrate units.

[15-Feb-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> However CPUs will likely get a good hashrate bump in the next generation. With 7nm Ryzen on the immediate horizon

[15-Feb-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> And also better efficiency due tot the die shrink

[15-Feb-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @fng77  as said allready, i have invested a lot of time in doing researching on hardware and geographical centralizaton due electricity prices. Difficulity is the factor that forces out ALL the miners (expect a handfull hardcore miners) that live in higher electricity regions. The world average electricity price is around 13 cents per kw/h. The  higher the difficulty gets the more miners from higher electricity price regions get forced out.

[15-Feb-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Cuttlebit , i assume the same will happen to the next generation FPGAs someone will build immediatly after it's clear that FPGAs are tolerated on the Verus network. And than again, while eventually, if we take it for given that the next cpu's will have better hashrate, i'am pretty sure they can't compare in MH/s per Watt, and that's the important point.

[15-Feb-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Have in mind currently the best Ryzen's are 3.25 less electricity efficient compared to the first FPGA!!!

[15-Feb-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @boxalex there is also possible improvement in current cpu miners available. We are on very early releases don’t forget

[15-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @boxalex you also mention an 8700k pulling 6-7MHs while I run this and pull 16-17MHs

[15-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And other CPUs like Ryzen and TR being better for mining that are mainstream.

[15-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> So we are not looking at 15-20x the performance.

[15-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Ginasis Mining Pools , how much improvement do you have on CPU mining? You have right now to close a gap of x3.25. Means the Ryzen 5 2600 for example must either mine 17.5 MH/s  at 30 Watt or around 55 MH/s at 65W. That's not realistic. Actually my bet goes that the FPGAs are getting even more efficient with some tweaking....

[15-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Yes, in the performance per department it FPGAs will likely always remain superior

[15-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I said i mine with an 8700k WHILE working

[15-Feb-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I can do basically anything but game while mining

[15-Feb-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> and use only 5 threads, that's what i call average joe mining.

[15-Feb-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> you can use 8-10 and still have good CPU performance

[15-Feb-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Ginasis Mining Pools , that's you, again, i'am talking about average joe miners that run mining beside working, gaming on their PC. It shouldn't be a question on what's possible for a single person but what the majority average joe miners are doing.

[15-Feb-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> You cannot hinder progression based on a small portion of a community

[15-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> There is always going to be something bigger and better than what you currently have.

[15-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> And again, i took the 8700k as an example as i have first hand data for it. If you want, compare it to an i3 whatever version to compare to the FPGA.  These guys literally can stop now mining if difficutly goes up.

[15-Feb-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I don't want to stop anything. I'am just adding important information and showing the full big picture in advance on what happens in future. Nothing more, nothing less. I even didn't say don't let FPGAs on, that's not my point or incentive. Others have to make decisions. I just wanted to add more information, that's it.

[15-Feb-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I’d imagine serious miners looking to turn the maximum profit will turn to FPGAs. However the goal will be to strike a balance between CPU, FPGA and GPU miners

[15-Feb-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Cuttlebit , i understand the goal and hence, it's the reason i'am here even and interested in verus. Just my personal opinion is that a balance should be in the range of 1.5. Everything above is disbalance, but than again, that's just my personal opinion. There is exactly 0 chance a miner can compete with a 3.25+ difference factor on efficiency. Leave alone the 2 cent china miner compared to the 35 cent per kw/h german miner.

[15-Feb-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I think maybe GPUs need to get a bump which places them in between CPUs and FPGAs

[15-Feb-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Morning all.

[15-Feb-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Heya

[15-Feb-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @boxalex Yes, the FPGA is the most efficient solution for mining VERUSHASH v2.0 but..

[15-Feb-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We are not planning on our miners nerfing the network like has happened before

[15-Feb-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We are limiting sales to prevent this

[15-Feb-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We also have a 6 boards per customer rule to support decentralisation7

[15-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @CryptoYeti , this raises 2 more problems

[15-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Granted, difficulty will be affected

[15-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> 1.) limited access to hardware is automaticly favouring centralization

[15-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> 2.) that

[15-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> but not like it was on V1 by previous FPGAs

[15-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> 's your fpga, how will garantee for others?

[15-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> *who

[15-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Unfortunately, as much as I would like others to adopt our ethics I'm not sure thats possible

[15-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> As said, that's the problem

[15-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> totally agree

[15-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> which is why we have approached this as ethically as possible

[15-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex thanks for your input buddy. Here is my opinion on the issue. CPU compared to FPGAS
1. The CPU mining has zero investment requirements. You either hand a good cpu for work or gaming. 
2. CPU 60mhs/250w thus .24mhs/watt
3. FPGA 70mhs/80w thus 0.875mhs/watt
4. There for improvement in efficiency is x3 but hardware is about 33% of the price. 
Conclusion, FPGAs are not good enough to kill of cpu mining.

Difficulty changers
1. Firstly, the difficulty changes 33%-50%, based on the big jumps in price, because of the CPU farms from China. 
2. The investment opportunity for the FPGAs is so minimal it seems the effect will be minimal. If 50% of the hash becomes FPGAs and force farms out that will be good and might lead to higher rewards because of less dumping.
Conclusion is that it could go either way with regards to difficulty changes benefiting or harming cpus, but it will be minimal. 

Centralisation
1. With regards to the price of the electicity for getting coins for decentrailisation, its better for cpus to be less efficient so that the hash is less centralised around china's cpu farms.
2. I think that these FPGA make is eaiser for hobbyist miners because these fpgas are for normal pcs and are plug and play. 
3. The efficiency of the FPGA miners actaually makes it easier for people in developed countries to run them to mine verus. 
Conclusion, FPGAs make the hashing power more decentalised.

[15-Feb-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Look, i have myself an bigger asic facility and it's the biggest mistake i ever made since participating in crypto. I'am coming from the ZEC community and than back i supported asics, shame on me, as said, biggest mistake. As i saw than back the full impact i decided to research every single impact mining hardware as and most important the impact of electricity prices. Most underestiminate them and than wonder at a given point while the top mining pools are in china and the whole network is dominated by chinese miners.

[15-Feb-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> dude. Ash (the other founder) and myself are miners too. CPU/GPU/ASIC. We do understand the frustrations

[15-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> this is why as hatrdware devs we are trying really hard to be as ethical as possible

[15-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Someone was always going to develop FPGA for VERUS. Personally i'd much rather an ethical team doing that.

[15-Feb-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , the inital price has about 0 effect, hence it should be the least important way after difficulty and most important electricity effiency. About the dificutly changes. Based on the FPGA miner with limited availability, maybe, but it won't be only this FPGA for sure. If you give me numbers on how many units are going to be sold for ALL batches i will make a calculation on how much difficulty will raise. As i have even no numbers for batch 1 i hope we get some numers right now.

[15-Feb-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @CryptoYeti , how many units is batch 1 and how many batches are planned?

[15-Feb-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Batch 1 is 500 units

[15-Feb-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We are likely to only do 2 batches.

[15-Feb-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We'll be watching the markets and charts and mostly likely adjust up/down as things pan out

[15-Feb-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> No one can stop FPGA's hitting the network again, but I do hope we can do this in a better manner than others have.

[15-Feb-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> initial price is important buddy. 0 investment means you can take profit even if minimal. Any other investment is a risk that needs to be paid off. I think that FPGAs for verus are different because miners that are trying to get maximum  profit wont be on verus coin. There are just other coins to snipe that are way more profitable. So, the impact won't be as high. Also, It will mainly be people who are interested in verus coin that get these FPGAs and the will be more likely to hold rather than dump. So, increases in price are more likely and hashrate more secure.

[15-Feb-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 500 of these little FPGAs is tiny!

[15-Feb-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> the black miner F1 had thousands of super powerful FPGAs

[15-Feb-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> with 10x the chips in each xD

[15-Feb-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , the 0 investment has it's very advantages as well. More miners, more community, more decentralization, fairer distribution, fair harware availability and a lot more. Just as an counter argument.

[15-Feb-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> these new fpgas are equal to my cpu. The last FPGAs were like 60 x 1080 tis. Huge difference.

[15-Feb-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , i have doubts you are the average joe miner than....

[15-Feb-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex 0 investment also means that 50% of the hash rate if often Chinese cpu farm dumpers. So, it can go both ways

[15-Feb-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> agree, that's the POW problem in generally.

[15-Feb-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex I mine with 2x AMDs and a 2990wx. I literally have a work/gaming station. No specific mining hardware. This will be my first time I get specific mining hardware.

[15-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So, FPGAs will be better for the difficulty and I believe they will improve profitability for CPU miners

[15-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I could be wrong, but that is my opinion.

[15-Feb-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> impossible. CPU miners are getting forced out on higher electricity regions. I didn't make a calculation yet, but my guess is that every CPU miner above 10 cents per kw/h won't stay profitable after 1st batch is online..... Current price in mind.

[15-Feb-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> just vague, don't nail me on that one

[15-Feb-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> it's actually and elemtary logical conclusion: The more hashrate => the higher difficulty => the more shifting towards low electricity regions. 100% garantee!

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> This is ideal. If we can get all the cpu farms out because it is not efficient enough as you said then 50% of the POW coins wont be dumped. If cpu miners are mining at 0.15 per kw/h, they can accumulate, stake and price will gradually get higher.

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> that's not how it works mate

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 100% not guaranteed. You underestimate the 50% dumping and how it effects the price. its just how it works mate

[15-Feb-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> you can't force out the 2 cent per kwh chinese miner, you force out the average joe miners

[15-Feb-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex we force them out every other week

[15-Feb-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 150GH falls to 75GH-90GH every time they dump the coin

[15-Feb-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> You forget that CPU farm miners will mine something else if slightly less efficient

[15-Feb-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I don't forget it and i don't have in mind the autoswitching profit miners, which is a problem for itself actually.

[15-Feb-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Like i said, I'm still confident about my conclusions made above. FPGAs are good for the project/community and cpu miners.

[15-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> That's your opinion and that's ok, i have gone through this allready with ZEC with 1000's of hours research done by now. Have always in mind that an FPGA is actually an ASIC itself, no matter we call it here a FPGA.

[15-Feb-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I think if FPGAs were only 1.5x more power efficient than CPUs, then no one will get them right? Unless you are running a super farm where every watt saves you big time. With CPUs you have more flexibility, and also better resale prospects if you decide to shut down.

[15-Feb-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I mean, CPUs and GPUs are also technically ASICs lol

[15-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit completely agree. I actually think that the investment prospects of these fpgas is so slim that the only people it makes sense for is the people believe in veruscoin long term. This is also a good thing. Any other miner for profit investor would probably buy else where.

[15-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> GPUs have the specific application of graphics acceleration, and CPUs have the specific application of doing everything else 😛

[15-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 'amd64 asic'

[15-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> *scnr*

[15-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> RAM is also asics

[15-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> lol yes technically

[15-Feb-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> my trainers are also asics too

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> *scnr*

[15-Feb-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> And an FPGA will never be an asic. They’re not application specific

[15-Feb-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> My Z9’s are ASIC’s, soon to be doorstops though

[15-Feb-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I guess the best analogy for FPGAs. Is it's like an interpreter for hardware. If 'ASICs' are C++ then FPGAs is like python

[15-Feb-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh, so broken IP conference 'spider' phones finally have a successor in being doorstoppers

[15-Feb-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats good to hear 🤣

[15-Feb-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> The last FPGAs were snakes in the grass, that's for sure.

[15-Feb-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @CryptoYeti i wonder, is there a maximum amount of FPGA units per order/person in your first batch?

[15-Feb-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , i get where you are coming from and your logic. But from history and experience it's not how it will work (Doesn't exclude that it could work!). From experience it's like: 1.) After you have an initial investment most people want to ROI. 2.) The more volatile a given currency the higher the chance coins gets dumped. 3.) The higher the difficutly the higher the sell pressure to achieve ROI. This said i wouldn't count on that FPGA miners aren't looking for profit and ROI. One good thing with CPU mining is that as there is no initial investment the sell pressure should be lowest.

[15-Feb-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or the other way around, have there already been orders of like 100 boards at once?

[15-Feb-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> He said earlier 500 FPGA for 1st batch, limit to 6 per customer.

[15-Feb-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Biggest order is 6 cards. Thats the limit
