[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Now, when you consider what is coming with PBaaS, the ability to make money on all sorts of projects that use the Verus system through mining and staking, that earning potential itself will have the effect of more decentralized mining on Verus and other projects in its ecosystem simultaneously.

[19-Feb-19 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For example, the current PBaaS work will enable a combination of merge mining and stake-based contribution to PBaaS chains that scales and allows PBaaS projects to start up and offer earning to miners and stakers, as long as they are also mining and staking Verus. This means that each miner will be able to both mine Verus, and currently (could change before even early release) up to 8 other PBaaS chains of their choice at the same time, each hash being leveraged across all 9 chains.

[19-Feb-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> every miner or staker could choose to participate in these projects or not, and the combination of projects they choose to mine and stake could be different for every single miner and staker if there are that many live projects running. Most often, miners and stakers will choose projects to support based on profits, but often people will choose projects to mine and stake along with Verus because they believe in the project, bringing new people constantly to the Verus ecosystem and providing more decentralization incentive through that as well.

[19-Feb-19 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> If we find that there is an issue in imbalance based on VerusHash 2.0, I believe that the work we did there, which was originally targeting a more modest equalization than we have achieved, could be adapted for further equalization. Right now, there are new generations of CPUs coming out, and we have yet to see how FPGA evolves. To the extent I have concerns about the potential impact of FPGAs on decentralization of the network and growth of Verus as a whole, I believe we should consider these factors as data to inform our decisions going forward. I think UKMiner and Cuttlebit have done an incredible job developing their FPGA designs in an open and community friendly way, and Cuttlebit has also expressed interest in helping the community support additional hardware types or possibly even providing feedback or help on algorithmic tuning for the best network health and decentralization over time. Where we are now is a far better position than we were when the first FPGAs came out, and none of this particular round of discussion takes the PoS component, which is 50% of network validation, security, and distribution into account. I have recently heard from people who have been accumulating during the recent drops, and by doing so, they are participating in another form of decentralization that will contribute to health and security of the network as well.

[19-Feb-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @markv my personal opinion is that @ukminer17 is legit, and I believe @Cuttlebit , who did the bitstream work has engaged the community with high integrity and a very helpful technical approach, not limited to FPGAs. Neither the Verus Coin Foundation, nor I have any affiliation with or compensation from UKMiner, and that is just my personal opinion based on how they were first recommended to us and their work and open cooperation all the way through.

[20-Feb-19 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Thanks Mike! I'm noob here, can u pls tell me what's the best CPU to mine Veruscoin?

[20-Feb-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ukminer17> the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 has a pretty good price/hash ratio

[20-Feb-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ukminer17 is right about that CPU being the best price/perf that I've seen recently. It's not the best performance of all choices, and some of the newer CPUs have yet to be fully optimized, but from those easily available, it's best bang for the buck and the example we used to determine that the UKMiner V1 is just over 1.5x price/performance. All of the Ryzen or threadrippers seems to be ahead on price performance over other CPUs right now.

[20-Feb-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Thank you both!!

[20-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Thanks, @miketout, for that reasoned and knowledgeable response. I know no one has a crystal ball here. And when you consider the kind of community member/investor who's still anywhere within a hundred miles of crypto after the year we've had, honestly, I have to admit I think some ppl- I'll even include myself- might be in a little more need of certain reassurances as they conduct their research and due diligence....I continue to support Verus. I wish us all the best on this continuing journey.

[20-Feb-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> One thought that I have about the fast raise in VRSC value the latest, could that be connected to the release of the FPGA miner? More people getting interested in VRSC now with introduction of a effective miner? I could of course be wrong.

[20-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @ukminer17 yes the Ryzen 2600 seem like a very effective cpu!

[20-Feb-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I like the rise in value, but thas not why im active in this forum and in VRSC, I like the people here more. Glad to be part of the team here!

[20-Feb-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> When I wrote to ukminer "that it seem like bla, bla" do you say seem or seems I think about that all the time when using the word seems?

[20-Feb-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Well if you look at bitcoin/eth and the entire market in general, it‚Äôs all rising in the last few days

[20-Feb-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes i have been seeing that too

[20-Feb-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> summer vibes maybe üòõ

[20-Feb-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Difficult technical analytical stories about bitcoin value, predicted the bear market would turn into a bull market. Which is happening now... Doesn‚Äôt explain the rising VRSC-BTC rate, though. I imagine the recent press releases have drawn some interest...

[20-Feb-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> vrsc/btc has been pretty flat for a while. Spikes to 3k, drops back down to 2500 sats.

[20-Feb-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Pretty much since the beginning of December

[20-Feb-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If you take out the big pump between October and December it's still up a decent amount from initial trading in August

[20-Feb-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Since there is no vrsc/usd markets it's pretty pointless to look at any usd figure

[20-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Question: WIth the current hashrate approximately how much VRSC you can mine a day using Ryzen 5? Thank you!

[20-Feb-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My ryzen5 2600 @4050 MHz does about 3.5-4.0 VRSC per day on ginasispool...

[20-Feb-19 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Any big accumulator of vrsc that is happy with selling at 2500 sats or above will continue to keep the price down, until buy volume increases enough to drain that sell will, which may or may not be to cover costs. The current ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of vrsc is highly speculative.

[20-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> @Oink, thanks! How about staking. Let's say you have 100 Vrsc how much you will earn when you stake?

[20-Feb-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> @markv mining questions should be directed to #mining

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @jintaa I am pleased to say I will soon be running around 20% of the network hash right here in the USA using good old CPUs

[21-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> So I believe fears about centralization abroad and due to FPGA is highly overblown

[21-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> there's a counterweight in terms of capital availability and cost of capital

[21-Feb-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Miners need to sell eventually to recoup capital expenditure. Someone needs to buy. They can stake.

[21-Feb-19 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I want to stake, so I buy
