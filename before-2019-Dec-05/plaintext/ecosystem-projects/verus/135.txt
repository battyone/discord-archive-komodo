[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Create a zs address or use one from earlier in Receive tab. Copy the address. Go to Send tab and choose 'Shield all recent coinbase transactions'. Paste the copied address in the 'Send to' field, then press 'Shield funds' button, and confirm.

[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> gotcha. thanksüëä

[31-Mar-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Once you gotten at least 1 block confirmation of that transaction you can send it back to a transparent address for staking or whatever. But the important part is that you have to wait for at least 1 confirmation to continue transferring those funds.

[31-Mar-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> btw, 0.5.5 had some staking issues, where it would stop staking when transferring funds to private addresses. You might want to upgrade, depending on your needs. 0.5.6 has been available for a long time. I'd recommend upgrading, but I can't stress enough about the importance of backing up your wallet on a regular basis, at least before upgrading Agama.

[31-Mar-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> appreciate the help

[31-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> i downloaded v0.5.6-beta but it has been "rescanning blocks" for about 15minutes already. is that normal?

[31-Mar-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It can be, especially if you haven't used the wallet for a while and it needs to catch up.

[31-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hmm... 0.5.6 was also the version where they moved a few folder targets... if the transactions list is empty and states something about "An error has occured" while it's rescanning, it might help to restart. I think that was a bug as well.

[31-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I thought it was an earlier version that moved the files, but restarting the application doesn‚Äôt hurt...

[31-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 0.5.5b has the database location changes.... (just checked github)

[31-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> i dont get an error msg

[31-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> just that its rescanning blocks

[31-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> when i first statted 5.6 it said up to block 400k something...but then switched to rescanning

[31-Mar-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> going on around 45mins now

[31-Mar-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> if i hit the "i" info button it says

synced headers 438829
synced blocks 438829

[31-Mar-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> anyone know curent block height?

[31-Mar-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @zpajk  if I may ask .. is there any commands or means to confirm that I am staking it right? I just feel very vulnerable seeing staking = true but nothing coming in  haha

[31-Mar-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I know the feeling. I've expressed my trust issues for the staking earlier, but every Agama version so far has indicated that "Staking: true" is accurate.
Another option is to look at ``%appdata%\Komodo\VRSC\debug.log`` and scroll to the bottom. The timestamp might be off due to GMT differences, but look at the "height=" parameter stated and the regular phrase ``Searched for eligible staking transactions, no winners found``.

[31-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Using cli command ``listunspent`` you should be able to see all the transactions you're staking.

[31-Mar-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The cli command `getmininginfo` will show you your staking status...
(I feel a guide coming on CLI commands and how to apply them when you installed the GUI wallet...)

[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> I'm surprised verus is still so illiquid

[01-Apr-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @Godballz @Hollowman9000 and really everyone for making this such a community effort. I really appreciate knowing that the community is supporting each other and working on software and ideas to improve things as well. This will be the biggest upgrade yet, and I can't wait to startup our first PBaaS chains üòÉ At the same time, @michaeltoutjr has also made good progress on a new upgrade to Agama and a Verus Mobile that should be available in the app store in the not too distant future. @J Oliver Westbrook has also been making progress on VerusPay. Lot's of progress, but I won't rest until PBaaS is humming along üòÉ

[01-Apr-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Oh man. Congratulations  @miketout. I'm really looking forward to this technology

[01-Apr-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Akira X take in account that all rewards bigger or equal to 96 VRSC are time locked and mature randomly over a time period of 25 months, no pre-mining, no ICO and the age of the chain being just over 10 months...

[01-Apr-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> @SmeLLyArMpiTs regarding your staking question yes, it outputs staking=true only if the check for staking is actually true, it‚Äôs not designed to provide false positives but rather report on the actual state of the process running

[01-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @J Oliver Westbrook  thank you üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <jonnybbig> Another random question ..trying to sign up for cryprobridge and they redirect me to ‚Äúfractal‚Äù website for KYC info and they literally want to know my ENTIRE life‚Äôs info ..how little privacy is that? Is this everyone‚Äôs experience?

[02-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jonnybbig Have you tested Digitalprice or STEX? Might be less KYC data required on those two, but honestly don't remember.

[02-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> It's pretty minimal for digitalprice, especially for only the first verification level

[02-Apr-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @jonnybbig#2316 CryptoBridge implemented KYC for US account holders only. If you use a VPN all the time you never have to put KYC.

[02-Apr-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonnybbig> that's great idea @dakgnosis  ...i've been too cheap to do so but it may be in my future..thanks!

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> hey all! I have the digital proof ready for the physical coin. I have it designed using antiqued silver (antiqued silver shows the details of the coin better, whereas regular silver loses some of the detail when light is shining on it due to it's reflectivity) Let me know what you think! https://imgur.com/maMdtVS

[03-Apr-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> keep in mind that in direct light, itll be hard to read since the silver is really shiny. let me know what you guys would rather want. Also, @Thoskk how is the latin phrase opposite (just curious)?

[03-Apr-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My google translate tells me it reads `True power can not be bought` in Latin...

[03-Apr-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth  When translated into English, the Latin means "True virtue can be will buy" (no typo here).  And it doesn't even catch all, because "virtus" is a female noun, but "verus" a male adjective. English language doesn't care about gender, other languages do.
The correct Latin phrase should be something like "Virtus vera emere non potest". And the "Verus" is gone...

[03-Apr-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not really.

[03-Apr-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Oink there is no "not" in the Latin.

[03-Apr-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know...your translation makes more sense... 
I don‚Äôt know Latin, but since French, Spanish & Italian are all part of the Latin family, i do recognize the structures...

[03-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> unless this is some idiomatic phrase that means opposite in Latin ...

[03-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I can‚Äôt say, without a full 3-year coarse in Latin

[03-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> btw. "emere" may be wrong either ... but I'm not completely sure here.

[03-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Ahhh gotcha

[03-Apr-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it's been 30 years since I last translated into Latin üòÑ

[03-Apr-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Actually, I think a proper translator (not google!!!!) should decide what is correct...

[03-Apr-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, totally agree. Anybody with a Diploma in Latin here? üòÑ

[03-Apr-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> You trying to go for a coloration when the light hits it?

[03-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> something like that ... just an idea

[03-Apr-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Thoskk just got an answer, negative on the tempered look

[03-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And a coating on the raised parts, is that possible? ( like glass coatings)

[03-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or laser etching?

[03-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Oink  epoxy coatings yea

[03-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That may give a coloration on reflection
