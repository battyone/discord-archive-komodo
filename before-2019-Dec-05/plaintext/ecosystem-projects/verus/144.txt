[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or an auction on the special numbers

[16-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I bet most people would not know what "digital set" has to do with 1, 10, 11, and 100 ... which reminds me that there are 10 kinds of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

[16-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Haaahahaha

[16-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> That's awesome

[16-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 😂 what about the other 8? 🤣

[16-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> _exactly_

[16-Apr-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Draeth you can always release a digital set when this one is sold out...

[16-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or a Prime set.. (only prime numbers...)

[16-Apr-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> next would be Fibunacci ...

[16-Apr-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> And I could think of an elemental set ... numbers of masses of most abundant isotope per element... 😂

[16-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Whoehahaha

[16-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or a Fuzzy logic set

[16-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm... and a Schroedinger set ... you won't know if the coin is there until you open the box... ^^

[16-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Is the coin alive, or is it dead?

[16-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol

[16-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, there are endless possibilities ^^

[16-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> An Infiniti set...

[16-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yep, or a gogol-set ^^

[16-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> to make it shorter

[16-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the invisibility set would be cheapest...

[16-Apr-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not sure ... ever tried to buy invisible metal?

[16-Apr-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It’s also infinitely thin

[16-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It calls Graphene a fatty!

[16-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hey, does anybody in here own an atomic force microscope? So it could be build of several gold atoms .. ^^

[16-Apr-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Didn’t  Wistar post something about that last week

[16-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm, can't remember ... oh btw... should we switch to #off-topic _maybeee_...

[16-Apr-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Well,  this is still semi verus related.... we're talking about possible versions of the verus physical coin lol

[16-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hey, since the coins exist, and really are cool, shouldn't we announce and tweet about them?

[16-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Draeth please DM me, if you want to help get that done.

[16-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or we could craft the announcement / tweet here with the community 😃 i'm still focused on development, but I can help post as needed

[16-Apr-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @miketout I'll dm you

[17-Apr-19 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Apr-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> @VoskCoin yeah the fastest I can get from a 1080ti is 6-7 Mh/s so not sure how much more is possible.. great video . been watching you since the start 👌

[17-Apr-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> 5watts @ 1Mh/s $35... not bad either (you can get them cheaper than $55)

[17-Apr-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aikida3k> What is the total number of coins mineable and what is the effusion schedule? I haven't even  been able to google it.

[17-Apr-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed: great video!

[17-Apr-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @aikida3k I think you want to know that specifically for Veruscoin? In that case I’ll refer you to the white paper on the https://veruscoin.io website. In the #faq-chosen channel you may also find some info on it, but not complete.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf> Page 21, and max supply 83 540 184.

[17-Apr-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @zpajk Did you **finally** read the white paper .... 😅

[17-Apr-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Looked up the emission a few months ago, to understand an inconsistency in the staking spreadsheet between two 24 block reward stages. But the fault isn’t important at this point in time.

[17-Apr-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I noticed that inconsistency...

[17-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I was not sure about the exact duration of each phase when I made the spreadsheet, and I didn’t want to bother Mike with that small detail at the time. He was quite busy, as always, and if needed I could change the value if it is off target. Happy to update the file if confirmed.

[17-Apr-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jabberwok> hi

[17-Apr-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Cragorn Mike will have to confirm the values...

[17-Apr-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hi Jabberwok

[17-Apr-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jabberwok> omg what is this wallet

[17-Apr-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jabberwok> not really user friendly at all

[17-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yeah, no offense intended, @Cragorn. Kudos for making the spreadsheet either way! I dm:ed you about it a while back, where I also sent my interpretation of the eras.

[17-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm not a fan of agama either btw, i hope we will have a **proper** wallet GUI some day

[17-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> anyways.

[17-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> could some agama user help me test something, namely getting the zcash params off veruscoin.io ?

[17-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thankyou

[17-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @superbig can you DM me please if you still cannot download zcash params off veruscoin.io - i just tested it successfully

[17-Apr-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @zpajk I remember. I didn’t reply then because I was busy at work, and forgot. I knew about the difference when I made the spreadsheet, but it was set up as well as I was able to when trying to interpret the timing of the block halvings. I sent the link to Mike to have him check it out. Shortly after it was published in #faq-chosen

[17-Apr-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Here is the info I based the spreadsheet on.

[17-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Publication in #faq-chosen should mean they checked it... So we can assume it is correct...

[17-Apr-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> My interpretation.
Era, reward amount, from blockheight, blocks until next stage. 
```var rewards = [
 [1, 0-384, 0, 10079],
 [2, 384, 10080, 43199],
 [2, 192, 53280, 43199],
 [2, 96, 96480, 43199],
 [2, 48, 139680, 43199],
 [2, 24, 182880, 43199],
 [3, 24, 226080, 1051199],
 [3, 12, 1277280, 1051199],
 [3, 6, 2328480, 1051199]
];```

[17-Apr-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> and then halving every indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)

[17-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> BTW @zpajk That's how I interpreted it too.

[17-Apr-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> BTW, I am just converting that FAQ about the XLS sheet to web format, so I'll skip it for now, untill I get some confirmation on the 24VRSC period.

[17-Apr-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Exactly, and with the clause that “blocks until next stage” is free for interpretation as “from blockheight” is the important one.

[17-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> For me, that what is in the white paper is leading information, but I need to be sure that is also actually what the blockchain is programmed to do...

[17-Apr-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But FAQ-8 and the whitepaper definitaly contradict eachother

[17-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining haha certainly deserved some air time, with my research you’ve been doing a lot — for awhile too! & that’s cool to hear! Thanks for the support 😄

[17-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Godballz thank you 😄 progress and profitability more than merits it

[17-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin hey buddy. I'm a fan of yours. I got into mining beam and grin because of you

[17-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You were a day early with your show... LOL... Trying to finish FAQ's so I didn't have to answer them individually.... LOL

[17-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good show, though!

[17-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Oink that would make things too easy if we synced up 😜

[17-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> only 7 left....

[17-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @GlorymanRTS that’s awesome glad I could help! & thanks for the support 😄

[17-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin good to see you in the verus community. I still need to watch your verus video. Also, I just bought at radeon vii

[17-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You didn't mention UKminer... I was a bit surprised by that, though...

[17-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Yeah, nice to have you here Vosk 😃

[17-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @GlorymanRTS nice what do you plan to mine with it? & if you don’t mind I’d love your feedback on my latest video, what you liked, didn’t like, want to see more of etc

[17-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Oink if you look at my browser I actually had ukminer open

[17-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> But I forgot to actually talk about it 🤦🏻‍♂️

[17-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @VoskCoin Are you going to do a show about the merged mining possibilities as soon as PBaas is live?

[17-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin hey bro, have you heard of RITOCOIN. Sure bro, I will watch it and write out some thoughts. Also, I will experiment with radeon vii and see what seems best.

[17-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> I guess it will have to be an Easter egg for now 🥚

[17-Apr-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I am a community leader at ritocoin. We would love for you to consider making a video. We have some very unique features on RITO coin including a curved block reduction. @VoskCoin

[17-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin maybe you could try buying the ukminer and make a video

[17-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> I’ll have to look into it, I’m slammed into May currently though 

Have any ukminers shipped yet?

[17-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ukminer seems like the best value for money FPGA

[17-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Try if they send you a promotion sampler...

[17-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin not yet, soon upfully

[17-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Oink I’ll certainly cover it, unsure when

[17-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> I dont know if anyones has seen my new webchain miner, they just forked away from cryptonight to make it more GPU resistant, but i think it may of had the opposit effect and a GTX 1060 gets 535h/s and a i7 8 cores about 200 h/s tahts doesnt tsound CPU biased to me..

[17-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink that's a great idea!

[17-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining what’d they fork into?

[17-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @ukminer17 @CryptoYeti fancy sending @VoskCoin a review sample of your FPGA for advertising?
