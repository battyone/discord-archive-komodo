mining pool for verus in development üòÄ

{Reactions}
üÜí 

[15-Jun-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hansen.ng> i would suggest starting the pool after the reward reach 96 , because of the timelocked constraint.

[15-Jun-18 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
by then hashrate could be 100GH and a pool will be needed for sure

[15-Jun-18 08:38 PM] $tefano.#3560
i will do it in the next days ( dev test too ), than when you would be start,  i will publish it

[15-Jun-18 08:38 PM] $tefano.#3560
i will do it when you decide üëç

[15-Jun-18 08:39 PM] $tefano.#3560
no hurry for now

[15-Jun-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> two things to consider when setting up a pool...
1) Currently, rewards are timelocked for a random time that can range from a couple months from now to two years and a couple months. Your pool will need to figure out how to distribute mining rewards with that constraint that we all have to deal with
2) When time locks are no longer applied, pools could differentiate themselves by moving rewards into stakeable addresses quickly and distributing staking rewards on funds that have yet to be disbursed
we will be working on pool support in a more focused way before the halving to 96, and we hope if someone does pool-related work prior to that, that they consider these points

[15-Jun-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Theo> Do kmd holders receive any for free?

[16-Jun-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @Theo We fully intend over time to support the Komodo platform's integration of technolgies like VerusHash, Verus PoS, advanced Verus parameters, and more for other Komodo platform coins that may want these advances, so in that way, KMD holders and the Komodo platform can benefit from Verus being on the platform. Other than that, as a fair launch coin, we ALL get coins from mining/staking. We, the devs, do plan to donate a large portion of our mining/staking earnings to support the project, but we're not ready to announce specifics, as we're still working on that. Until then, we are offering some community bounties, which we will continue to expand, so we can scale community involvement in the project.

@miketout thank you for your consideration on pool

[16-Jun-18 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> Hi @svarog , it definitely sounds like you aren't running the background server, which could be caused by a few things. usually, this is lack of supported instructions on the CPU.
Can you check that your CPU has both "aes" and "avx" flags with the program cpu-z at http://cpuid.com ?

[16-Jun-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Svarog> @miketout  aes  yes avx is not

[16-Jun-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Svarog> need to maintain instructions aes and avx simultaneously. or enough aes

[16-Jun-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> it needs both right now. that will change soon, but only for staking.

[16-Jun-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <lionmg> Hi is Verus available on an exchange anywhere? how can a non-miner obtain some?

[16-Jun-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> üòÉ

[16-Jun-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> I *just* posted in the trading channel to ask people if they'd like to join us (devs) in getting Verus onto an exchange. we're going to wait to hear from the community, but once we submit a non-accelerated application to crypto-bridge, we should be tradable from within 7 to 24 days, as I understand it.

[16-Jun-18 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> we'll donate to the cause, at least matching other community donations with 1/2 bitcoin, which is the listing fee for crypto-bridge, and if we get enough response without raising enough, we may donate more
we have applied to Bittrex, but that is the first step, and is unknown/can take some time. we are also engaging a legal firm to help prepare Verus Coin for other larger exchanges as well.

[16-Jun-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <lionmg> sounds good. does donating to help the exchange fund come with any coins in return?

[16-Jun-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Crypto bridge is a centralised service deceiving regular users to think they are a dex, best not to reward that

[17-Jun-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @lionmg as co-miners and stakers who don't plan to sell a bunch of coins, our interest in donating the 1/2 bitcoin would be to enable liquidity for the good of the coin while making the largest donations ourselves as members of the community also. we are offering to at least match the rest of the community's contributions out of our own mining and staking earnings, and what everyone gets in return is the ability to easily buy and sell Verus on an exchange.

[17-Jun-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <lionmg> fair enough, I wish I had some already. I'll buy some when it's on the exchange üëç
