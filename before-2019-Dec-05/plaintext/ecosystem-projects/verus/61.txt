[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hahhaah

[04-Dec-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii They are better off finding a better project, for their money, with a weaker dev team

[04-Dec-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Sorry, I'm so used to wenger.

[04-Dec-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Why weaker dev team, they dont pick the coin because of the dev team

[04-Dec-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman I'm a Sevilla supporter... He was our man for 3 UEFA Cup titles

[04-Dec-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii They should. Because they will be wasting money with man hours creating new tech, then they'll get forked...and it'll happen again and again

[04-Dec-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> So does the dev team, it depends who has more money to spend

[04-Dec-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have 4ghs rate and I made 1 coin since yesterday

[04-Dec-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You mean waste

[04-Dec-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You are being silly now ..

[04-Dec-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah its a waste on both sides

[04-Dec-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's about evening out the playing field. ASIC and FPGA developers want money, it's a business. CPU/GPU developers main interest isn't mining. I think FPGAs can co-exist in a crippled state. As for now they're too efficient, and sees only to the need of the few instead of the many.

[04-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @zpajk Who says CPU/GPU developers aren't about mining?

[04-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That's crazy

[04-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yeah, just look at RTX, what a great mining card.

[04-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ..

[04-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> The point was; CPU/GPU are for the many

[04-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FPGA main interest is not crypto

[04-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Everyone can buy a fpga. Its just online available as of now, but havent been actually to a store to buy computer parts in ages

[04-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's expensive

[04-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good points. Jumping in late, and more specifically- using a codename to represent Verus is straight scummy. It does seem to blatantly go against everything that has been worked so hard   for and ultimately the core values- Verus= veritas=truth- why mine in secret? Why not try to be a part of the community rather than dump coins on an unsuspecting market

[04-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @zpajk I'm not against them trying to make money, but why should we let them do it at the expense of ourselves. They made their money by secretly mining our shit. Now we make our money by folking  the suit out of it.

[04-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> So is the 2080 ti

[04-Dec-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> i got 1 GH/s help+100 MH/s my own and its still at 0.7 verus on pool

[04-Dec-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @zpajk It's expensive and hopefully Verus makes is obsolete, for mining this coin

[04-Dec-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> As @ok88  said, it was done in secret... F*ck that

[04-Dec-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah, i bet the scream wouldnt be as much if they said. Hey, we have a fpga now and are mining your coin. Thats whitefires fault with his bullshit: "lets mine secret cause they will fork". Im standing alone int the fpga community with my thought that it would be easier to approach the dev team before starting to develop a bitstream

[04-Dec-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That alone shows that it was ill intended

[04-Dec-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I tell you, you have to fight on more fronts now. You fork, someone else will pick up the development. It will be an endless fork bullshit

[04-Dec-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii If you approached the devs, they would've said no

[04-Dec-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> And you wonder why they are doing it secretly than ðŸ˜‚

[04-Dec-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CPU & GPU mining with VerusHash.... that's it ...
It's in the paper

[04-Dec-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And you guys are going against what is laid out, in that paper... That's where it stands right now

[04-Dec-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz Sup bro

[04-Dec-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cruz hey man

[04-Dec-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Actually where does it say that specific sentence in the whitepaper?

[04-Dec-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Mike did say asics may be inevitable unfortunately but I don't think anyone expected them so soon. Perhaps I don't understand the reasoning fully in it just yet but I don't see the value of having fpga on the network right now

[04-Dec-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Its skews the hashrate in a very lopsided fashion presently

[04-Dec-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Did he say FPGA? lol

[04-Dec-18 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> True and for the record I personally feel it sort of sucks

[04-Dec-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He did say that we might have to deal with this

[04-Dec-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm trying to play The Devil's Advocate here and look at both sides because Mike was considering negotiating and for the reasoning that the next wave of fpga miners might be less easy to get under control

[04-Dec-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Right exactly. I had always assumed it would be a more gradual ramp up

[04-Dec-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> These FPGA's are damn expensive

[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Which would further hurt a decentralization by placing large hash power in the hands of the wealthy

[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Bigger scale mining is a money game.. it moves fast

[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And unfortunately now it's not just bigger scale

[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Really? People buy a mining rig for that money. 1

[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> How much?

[04-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Thats a 4 card 1080 ti rig, maybe get a 1070 on top

[04-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A mining rig has more potential resale value and other uses. Arguably fpga evens out that Gap where asic could be left behind and rendered useless

[04-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> We've got to fork then lol

[04-Dec-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Fpga has resell value, its not an asic, you can actually do something with it ðŸ˜…

[04-Dec-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's why I said they close the gap between

[04-Dec-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But besides

[04-Dec-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think fpgas are worse than asics

[04-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @Yii  You get the fact that FPGAs aren't available for everyone? Both supply and price-wise. Even if FPGAs are good and well, as for now they're way more in favor of few people, taking advantage of others.

[04-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Hell I wish Mike and the team, could make my phone mine as much as gpu and cpu

[04-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No FPGA

[04-Dec-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Asics means that the coin is huge and its easier to keep folking away form asics. Also, asics are a huge investment. Fpgas are like close to impossible to stop without regular folking and they damage smaller projects

[04-Dec-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Why not? Most miners have one rig, hobby miners with 1-2 cards mine on nicehash as it is convenient. Its not even a good rig and everyone can buy it, no country restriction

[04-Dec-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Can't there be a way to create a hardware signature for the fpga each individually and add them to a blacklist updated regularly on the wallet so it doesn't affect anything else? Something along those lines Maybe? Like Hardware signatures only found in regular PCS but I imagine Asic would circumvent this anyway as they are part of standard PCS correct?

[04-Dec-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @Emmanuel  developer agility is better than doing nothing at all to work against centralization.  But centralization is a point of view so who ever is the loser in being decentralized will argue that everyone else is centralized.  In other words, if bitcoin forked tomorrow and was only CPU mineable all the ASIC miners would argue that bitcoin is now centralized to large CPU data centers.

At least with developer agility you would think their interests would represent the community and if that representation were untrue then there wouldn't be much of a community left.  For example, I've witnessed mixed feelings here about how the developer responded.  Of course, it all remains to be seen what will happen next.  My opinion is that it's the coin, use case, adoption, and such factors that actually matter.  Bitcoin is ASIC and successful as hell and there are sorts of examples of popular coins that are either CPU/GPU/ASIC/FPGA POS etc etc... even coins that are 100% premine and doing just fine.  It's bold success that matters.  Everything else is just squabbles of inferiority.

[04-Dec-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Bold success meaning, staying true to your values...

[04-Dec-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The problem I see right now with such a large gap in hashrate is that it has become very unprofitable to mine so people will stop and it will be for the most part mined by fpga. They have lower electricity costs and receive large amounts of coins so they will be able to dump the price. Ideally there will be a balance Maybe we are the miners who left buy the cheap coins and create value to bring the price back up but I feel like that might be a long shot

[04-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I posted the chart in trading. Please show where it damaged the coin value

[04-Dec-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It has the potential to does it not?

[04-Dec-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> An egg could be ate by a fox.  Or, it could grow into a chicken.

[04-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I didn't say it had affected price negatively yet just friendly discourse

[04-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Would you rather we forget about it and stop discussing it?

[04-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> More than likely the fox will eat the egg

[04-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> sure but to say 'potential'  idk... I could get hit by a bus tomorrow.  I'm all for friendly discourse  ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I find no harm in at least raising the subject

[04-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Haha

[04-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> There are so many bad projects out there with good price action

[04-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe potential was the correct word for the usage

[04-Dec-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why not FPGA one of them?

[04-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> It's less about correct word usage and more about logic

[04-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> I'm more into arguments of substance

[04-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> adding an FPGA doesn't make any coin more or less likely to fail

[04-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's more about people using a FPGA do not have any real ties to the project...do they?

[04-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Whatever we are supposed to be a community. I can see how something like this can be polarizing but I think it's important we at least discuss this and try to remember that we are all on the same side here

[04-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> You know what Raven won't fail?

[04-Dec-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> And you know why Raven will moon again?

[04-Dec-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @grendel25  BC it's on Binance

[04-Dec-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Billionaire CEO of O-stock... that's why.  CEO rich guy is going to make fireworks.  His ego is on the line

[04-Dec-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> a few people controling the price of the coin is one of the biggest factors of failing, look at etherum classic. They had to fork it because the coins were in the hands of only a few people.

[04-Dec-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah Patrick Byrne or whatever his name is..
That is Raven, this is Verus

[04-Dec-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I see the fact that someone with a massively disproportionate hashrate can then stake those coins and further consolidate the market. On the other hand, it makes me want one of these bad boys. I don't even know what a fgpa is but it sounds cool!

[04-Dec-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Raven has FPGA, valid logic point.  see?

[04-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Raven has 6B supply

[04-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> and look at Raven's hashrate... moon ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Verus has 80m

[04-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You're logic is completely off here

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> My point was to FPGA, don't steer the logic bro ðŸ˜ƒ

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It does seem a bit ironic that people are so upset about someone mining a privacy coin in secret

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> One coin is on Binance with billions of supply

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> what does the hashrate have to do with the supply? rvn has a 5000 blockreward, verus has 24...so what?

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Each project is unique...

[04-Dec-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> yeah, so we canÂ´t compare it
