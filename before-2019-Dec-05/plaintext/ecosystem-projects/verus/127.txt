[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> agama belongs to komodo right?

[10-Mar-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> on the one machine i do use a gui at all, i have both installed, komodo and verus agama.

[10-Mar-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well, "belongs to", yes kind of, it's one of their projects.

[10-Mar-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> can i upgrade the verus agama? lol

[10-Mar-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> your best bet is to install both i fear üòê

[10-Mar-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or just lern how the commandline of the wallets work üòâ

[10-Mar-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it will save you SO much trouble üòâ

[10-Mar-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> is there an official eth wallet?

[10-Mar-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> idk

[10-Mar-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> out of my knowledge territory

[10-Mar-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i am ok to learn commandlines..

[10-Mar-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i learn something new

[10-Mar-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> sending eth incur fees?

[10-Mar-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> how about sending verus?

[10-Mar-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you should think about being more proactive in taking in knowledge.

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> about every of your past questions can be answered with little to no time on google.

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> sorry.. am searching on google too

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and soon there will probably be a time when people feel you have asked enough you could've googled

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and will stop responding

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> just tot i will chat here

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> ok .. apologies

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this is not a 'shut up' but a 'consider this!'

[10-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but watch out for a book called 'mastering bitcoin'

[10-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> may be a little early on in your learning process

[10-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> hng, these came out backwards.

[10-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea, that book is very useful and explains a lot of the underlying concepts, that are similar between blockchains (despite being labeled as a bitcoin book)

[10-Mar-19 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> theres a free version on github, if you download a pdf tho, you did probably pirate it, these aint legal.

[10-Mar-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> ok thank you . .

[10-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> will find the proper version on github

[10-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the cool variant would actually be to buy it

[10-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the author did an exemplary job and i think it should be rewarded

[10-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you can buy PDFs, and these are legal.

[10-Mar-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dudezmobi> yeah

[10-Mar-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Didn‚Äôt some joker threaten to or actually release ‚Äúmastering bitcoin‚Äù after buying a copy?

[10-Mar-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Author made a power move and released it for free

[10-Mar-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I‚Äôd pay the man

[10-Mar-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hi community .. i need to reformat my mac.. i read the backup notes..  so basically i have to copy the wallet.dat to somewhere and restore it once i am done with reformat . .

[10-Mar-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes. you have some choices, copying away your wallet.dat to a safe place is probably one of the easier ones.

[10-Mar-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> obviosly double- and triplechecking everything while you copy it aside.

[10-Mar-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> am installing the ios test flight wallet

[10-Mar-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> see if i can migrate to that instead . .

[10-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i would recommend not mixing reinstall and experiments

[10-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just do the one thing first

[10-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and then play with the other

[10-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> especially because the IOS wallet is under active development still

[10-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that may end in desaster, even if the possibility for desaster isn't like 75%

[10-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's a bad idea still üòÑ

[10-Mar-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> ok mate. .   can i copy my private key and then reinstall? i dont mind downloading the block chain again . .   ( i tried to google and read but i cant find much on verus wallet besides the copy wallet.dat )

[10-Mar-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> copy off the wallet.dat

[10-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's a bit of pseudo security, because wether you loose your wallet.dat or your main private key isn't a huge difference unless your wallet.dat is encrypted

[10-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but you shouldn't store the plaintext keys

[10-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and to resync the blockchain use my bootstrap

[10-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it will save you a LOT of time

[10-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think it was `%%APPDATA%%/Komodo/VRSC` where you want to unpack this to: https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz

[10-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh wait. osx

[10-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> `~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/VRSC` probably

[10-Mar-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i cant even find my wallet.. this mac is killing me .. i think i will just abandon this wallet..

[10-Mar-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> mac is really really very restrictive in my opinion

[10-Mar-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i spent a few days trying to mine and i still cant get it right -.-

[10-Mar-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Do you have your seeds or your WIF-keys of all addresses in your wallet? If so you can access those addresses from a new wallet!

[10-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok... my helper instinct kicks in

[10-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if you trust me enough with it, i'll remote-desktop into your machine for 5min

[10-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> to show you where the stuff is

[10-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> also... doesn't osx have a search feature üòÑ

[10-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôll sit back and relax !

[10-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> try `cmd+space` and enter wallet.dat

[10-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that should do the trick imo

[10-Mar-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @0x03  i tried searching nothing came up.    even when i choose to see hidden files.    @Oink   i did not set any p/w nor phrases .. when i installed the wallet.. i went straight to sync and mine ..

[10-Mar-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> can you use a terminal, @SmeLLyArMpiTs

[10-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'll offer something you should never do: i'll send you over commands to copypaste that will copy the wallet.dat onto your desktop.

[10-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Shall we move to #community-support ?

[10-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but i think peer 'trust' should be enough in here for me to give an impression that i'm not fucking anybody over

[10-Mar-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Oink not this time, we'd split a lenghty discussion in half

[10-Mar-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and this doesn't help the general 'searchability' of the info üòâ

[10-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I have been thinking a lot about the UK FPGA miner. Some thought I have:

[10-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 1. Is there any chance that someone else will make a clone? Like china and sell it for 100 bucks or something? Heard it was opensource on the software.

[10-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 2. Will there be a version 2 in the nearest future and will this one be worthless in that case?

[10-Mar-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 3. Is there a possibility that versus 2.0 makes their algorithm "FPGA incompatible" in future?

[10-Mar-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 4. Are the community onboard with this FPGA miner? I mean do the think its ok?

[10-Mar-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 5. Is there a "firmware" in the device that can be upgraded in future, if there are bug and so on?

[10-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 6. I have a gpu mining rig. Can you dualmine, with say all the GPU:s and this one on the same motherboard, just as you can do with Cpu:s and gpus on the same board?

[10-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 7. What about this "blackminer" everybody is talking about? is it better, worse, same? Can it mine verus 2.0

[10-Mar-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Any info or your thoughts on this will be appreciated! üëÜ

[10-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> oops maybe I should have wrote this in "mining" therad?

[10-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> i also mailed these (and more) questions directly to ukminer.io, but would like to know what all you guys think also!

[10-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gregorst> 7) Blackminer is a fpga miner, recently it started to support verus 2.0 but bitstream's development is not ended, so the performance are not the max the miner can do

[10-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> holy moly thats a lot of questions üòâ

[10-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 1: always

[10-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @gregorst ok

[10-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 4: i am ok although i asked for any updates 3 times now, not getting any reply

[10-Mar-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so thats 'for now'

[10-Mar-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gregorst> 5) Fpga miners use bitstream and yes, you can install newer , remove older etc

[10-Mar-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 5: bitstream: yes. unsure if i go the whole picture

[10-Mar-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 1. Worries me.

[10-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well... anything can be copied

[10-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's more of a 'there is no way to stop such things' than a 'it will be copied 100%'

[10-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just to put it into perspective a bit more

[10-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> pretty tough if you buy something for 399 and two months later you can buy a better clone for 99

[10-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @fng77 someone could make a clone but the base xil chip in the unit isn‚Äôt exactly cheap let alone the development and production of a batch of units.
