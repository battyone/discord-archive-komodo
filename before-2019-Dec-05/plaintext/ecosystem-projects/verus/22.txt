[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Likely not.  The issue is the CPU's capabilities.

[25-Jul-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Is that calculation based on current system@ state or the system in general?

Because the cpu is currently working its little pants off

[25-Jul-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I understand that.  But if the CPU is having to do something that is not native, then the efficiency is just not there.  Your CPU is pre-Sandy Bridge.  I have a Sandy Bridge i7 that is probably one of the first CPU's to have the AVX extension.  It does about 32 Mh/s as compared to 230 Mh/s that a Kaby Lake i7 is doing.  And, that is WITH the AVX instruction set.

[25-Jul-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Your CPU is working very hard - no doubt.  But it is trying to take down a section of a prison wall with a tack hammer.

[25-Jul-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And it is likely still very good at many tasks... this is just not one of them.

[25-Jul-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Maybe nothing but does it work any better on less threads, like try 8 threads instead of 12, but stop the wallet mining first then try 8 threads , if it doesn‚Äôt work i would think thats it

[25-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Theres always more cpu‚Äôs out there üòÅ

[25-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @stretcher83 WHen the devs released the latest versions of the wallet and CLI miner, they stated that the wallet would run on non-AVX CPU's but at a significantly lower level of efficiency.   Prior to this release the wallet would not even run at all on older CPU's that were missing AVX.

[25-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That‚Äôs interesting and a shame really

[25-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I might be able to find some better gear

[25-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Or newer even

[25-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I had a very inexpensive G4400 that was running a 7 GPU rig just fine - wallet would not run on it.

[25-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> And theres no way of getting aes instruction set on cpus that dont have them , only option is upgrade the cpu?

[25-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Try to find a Ryzen 7 2700 - 400+ Mh/s

[25-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôm not able to upgrade the cpu. It‚Äôs on a Mac

[25-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Bummer.   Do you have any money to spend on this?

[25-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Wish I did but all my funds are tied up

[25-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> About 500 bucks USD and you could get 400 Mh/s or better.

[25-Jul-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Take a thumb drive to MicroCenter and run the CLI wallet on every machine you can get it on...  JK

[25-Jul-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Does the cli wallet run better?

[25-Jul-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Same thing - just a different face plate

[25-Jul-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I have a gaming rig I could try it on

[25-Jul-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> What CPU in it?

[25-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> My son runs it on his gaming box.

[25-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Not entirely sure, I would need to check specs but it‚Äôs mainly all gpu

[25-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôll find something, got a decent laptop

[25-Jul-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you do the laptop - elevate it a bit on the very sides and probably should not run all cores.  Air circulation will be important.

[25-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> So when we say it will run slowly on a system without aes and avx do we mean just linux and mac , and it wont run at all on a windows machine @jimboscott üëçüèº

[25-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @stretcher83 Those things have nothing to do with the OS.  They are chip capabilities that are hard coded in the CPU.

[25-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> the latest wallet has a software workaround - but compared to a native ability in the CPU - it is super inefficient.

[25-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> All of my mining is Windows.

[25-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> üëçüèº

[25-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> If I was to set up a rig with a better cpu any advantages of Linux over windows?

Windows should be a fairly quick set up

[25-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Got to love the reset function in windows 10

[25-Jul-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I need to ask because a friend of mine has multiple old motherboards from second hand pc‚Äôs or hand me downs, and the last two he tried didnt have aes or avx so its a bit frustrating for him , as you can imagine üòÅ

[25-Jul-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I can relate... I have allot of old and spare kit

[25-Jul-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sorry im currently on windows 10 myself so iv no experience with linux, but im trying to pick it up as i go along reading posts

[dscrdvrsc] <AlephNull> question:  I downloaded Agama 0.3.11-beta from verus website and it got to part of wallet sync and just stuck there - admittedly just on a relatively low end or mid end laptop - 64 bit Windows 8. Is there a time expectation of when that would sync? plan to get a larger computer later for mining but just wanted to explore it a bit on my laptop.

[26-Jul-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @AlephNull  It can take some time to synch, 10-15 min on my last install, but you should see blue bar showing progress. If not try closing Agama wallet and restarting.  Welcome to the Verus community!

[26-Jul-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AlephNull> @silkspinner thanks - worst case I'll get a bigger laptop lol - I am excited about the zero knowledge capacity here and the potential for "block chain as a service" !

[27-Jul-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> @Budd maybe attempt to close and reopen. the red exclamation on the other one means ithe CPU may not have AES or AVX so check that if it doesn't it cant mine under windows

What's the appropriate way to backup a mined wallet via cli? getbalance won't show until the coins are unlocked, but listtransactions shows what I believe are mined blocks. I try to bring the privkeys into agama but I do not show anything.

[28-Jul-18 01:23 AM] bishop#9773

[28-Jul-18 04:38 AM] bishop#9773
keypool size should be like 100 or 1000 but still, just curious

[28-Jul-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Matterbridge There is a way to force the CLI miner to mine to a single public key.   I have been doing that for about 2 weeks and it works like a charm.  It is in the FAQ section.  However, one thing that I found to be easier than what is in the FAQ is to get your public key from the GUI wallet.  It is super easy.  Go to your "Receive" section and pick one of your addresses - click the three dot menu to the left of the address and choose 'validate address'.  That will open up a blue/green box that has various data.  near the BOTTOM of that data, just above 'iscompressed: true' is your pubkey.  I found that MUCH easier than typing all of the directories and such in a CMD prompt window.   Once you have your pubkey (do NOT get confused and use the scriptPubKey found near the top of the blue/green box) follow the instruction in the FAQ on how to insert this into the startup command for the CLI miner.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I still cannot figure out why this is not around 10-15 Th/s.   At ~600 Gh/s there are probably no more than 1000 people mining this worldwide.  It just seems that SO many miners would have CPU's essentially just idling...

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Absolutely.  I look forward to the day when the block reward is 12 and CPU's and GPU's have pushed this to a healthy fraction of a Ph/s.

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its because when we try mining with little hash power, eg 61mg/s its , it very disheartening and frustrating not getting a block untill 16 days go by, im all for waiting for my rewards, it makes them all that more special, but when people say they get 10 blocks in a day and there luck just keeps going its hard for people to see any chance of finding a block with the small hashrate they can afford, im not havin a go or nothing but i can see a lot of people trying verus out then moving on quick because of no rewards

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sort of hurts decentralisation and the fun in mining verus
