[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Mike1900 two wallets is manageable.  I have 7...

[29-Jun-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> There are two particularly safe approaches -
you can mine with both wallets, then merge them later
or you can have one wallet on one computer, and have the other computer(s) mine to an address in the one wallet

[29-Jun-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have been importing the PRIV KEYS into my main wallet.   One at a time...

[29-Jun-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott Sounds like that aught to be time for some shell scripting

[29-Jun-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> gonna look into that later will starting understand block chain and mining first still not clear into my head

[29-Jun-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> It's not that big a task.   Especially with hte 600 GH/s net hash

[29-Jun-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Think of the blockchain as a huge serialized set of bank safe deposit boxes.   Your PRIV KEY is needed for each box (address) that you own.  The address is the PUBLIC key, but the only way to get what's in the boxes is with both the public and the private keys.  The wallet  is your set of keys.

[29-Jun-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Anyone can search using your public key and see a transaction.   But only someone with the private key can move the contents.

[29-Jun-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> does peoples can steal my wallet? except by taking my file?

[29-Jun-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> i mean what's is inside

[29-Jun-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> No.  They need your wallet data.  They can hack you or steal your laptop.... but they need the wallet.dat file.   If they get that then it is theirs.

[29-Jun-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just like if someone stole my keychain.

[29-Jun-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Of course, the bank will ID me and check my signature.... but same idea

[29-Jun-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok

[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> my SSd is encrypted at the boot gonna be hard to hack that if someone stole my laptop loll

[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> take care of that wallet.dat file.   What OS?

[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ubuntu

[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> 16.04

[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OK.  Not sure where the file gets stored with Linux

[29-Jun-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> i know know ðŸ˜‰

[29-Jun-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> good one

[29-Jun-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> i mean i just find the file now just need to backup it before going to sleep

[29-Jun-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> can we do it wile agama run?

[29-Jun-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> BTW, your 4 cores will do about 100 Mh/s   Mine was a 6 core Coffee Lake

[29-Jun-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Mike1900 no need to back it up until you find a block.

[29-Jun-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> a ok

[29-Jun-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> then tomorrow

[29-Jun-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> 10%  ow

[29-Jun-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> now

[29-Jun-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> hopefully.  be patient.  I am hashing close to 900 Mh/s and have just one block today.

[29-Jun-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> does the process need a lot of disk space?

[29-Jun-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> might take  you a week or more

[29-Jun-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> pretty low with an ssd right now

[29-Jun-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> gonna take me a week to get the first blockchain?

[29-Jun-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> which coin do you mine?

[29-Jun-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> my storage is 221 megs for this right now.  Yes.  A week or a day or 2 weeks.

[29-Jun-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok the % is not linear ?

[29-Jun-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> are you syncing now?

[29-Jun-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If it gets stuck you can shut down and restart it.

[29-Jun-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> What was your processor again?

[29-Jun-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> just got 11% in one hour

[29-Jun-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> yes of course

[29-Jun-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would shut it down and restart.

[29-Jun-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> am activating best chain now that is the process

[29-Jun-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> shut down what?

[29-Jun-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jun-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Shut Agama down and then start Agama back up

[29-Jun-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> should not take that long

[29-Jun-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok let me try

[29-Jun-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Your i5 has the AVX extensions but I am not sure about the other set ...

[29-Jun-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> System requirements: 64bit CPU/OS, CPU with AES-NI and AVX instructions. Windows, Linux (Ubuntu tested), or Mac High Sierra. 4GB Memory.

[29-Jun-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Gotta run for the night - good luck.

[29-Jun-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jun-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> does that mean i have found two blocks?

[29-Jun-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> and that i will get 384 VRSC?

[29-Jun-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> Yes lucky you

[29-Jun-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> if you move the direction tab you should see when the coins unlock

[29-Jun-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> i dont see where it mentions when the coins will unlock

[29-Jun-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> once unlocked the coins will show in the "Transparent Balance" section?

[29-Jun-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> Move the part in Black to the right and in the red part you will see a height (block number) when your coins become spendable. I'm not sure how the coins end up in your address I guess you will have to send them from agama as they are now in a locked address (p2sh)

[29-Jun-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> no problem.
yes it is

[29-Jun-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> cool. i have a bunch of servers with xeon processors... wondering if i should use them to mine  VRSC ðŸ˜„

[29-Jun-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> I guess so yes nothing else you can use them for....

[29-Jun-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> if you have 500+ Servers come over to KMD and join scaling they need some server power
