[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> All of the coins i've made thus far (for komodo and pirate) haven't had any special modifications to them (like different edging, dual tone metals, coloring, 3d designs, etc), aside from the antiqued look. So for both KMD and Pirate, it's been $21/coin with free shipping worldwide. The verus coin will be $1 less since there isn't an antiqued effect. Plus, I have tiered bulk pricing with % discounts based off the amount ordered.

[05-Apr-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Also, I use Veruspay, so you can pay in verus, pirate, kmd, btc and ltc

[05-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> (the last 3 use a different payment gateway that's similar to veruspay)

[05-Apr-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sounds reasonable... lets see what others say about the gold ðŸ˜„

[05-Apr-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> kk sounds good

[05-Apr-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Hey guys. Is there a good profit calculator for VERUS ?

[05-Apr-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, not really....

[05-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @sundownz There is a staking calculator pinned to the staking channel

[05-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> I am looking at mining... I have 124 pcs Opteron 6380 that I would consider using.

[05-Apr-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can check the pinned hashrate spreadsheet in #cpu-hashrate

[05-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That can giv you a speed indication.

[05-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> *Dual AMD Opteron 6282 31 threads generating 19-20 Mh/s*

[05-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would yield 2-3 VRSC at the current network speed

[05-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> So maybe your 124pcs * ~10 MH/s ... loose estimate

[05-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thatâ€™s ***very*** conservative, @zpajk . 6282 & 6380 are pretty similar processors... I would test one and go from there...
I see I missed the *dual*....

[05-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @sundownz You're welcome to try at least one and post your hashrate in #cpu-hashrate , it's always appreciated to gather more comparisons. ^^

[05-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> So like 2 or 3 VRSC a day ?

[05-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, of coarse that depends on network speed...

[05-Apr-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I recommend speedtesting one opteron first, so you have a more definitive number

[05-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hmm...  > 1 GH/s ... 0,5% of total network hash. 17280 PoW vrsc per day / 0,5% = 86,4 vrsc? 3-4 block rewards per day?

[05-Apr-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was just checking present network rate. Itâ€™s high again.i stand corrected, @zpajk

[05-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's been fluctuating today. 170 GH/s average, maybe?

[05-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think so... this afternoon it was 135, so 170 is realistic

[05-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Oink @miketout what do you think, a gold or a silver coin

[05-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Iâ€™ld go for silver: less pretentious...

[05-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So, that's 1 vote for silver, 1 for gold lol

[05-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Why not make a vote out of it.... mike, hurry with pBaaS, we need to vote... lol

[05-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Yah so like 9 MH per 6380 with the NHEQminer

[05-Apr-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ccminer is a couple of % faster... 130 Watts tdp on that Opteron?

[05-Apr-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> I couldn't get the ccminer going. These systems don't have any real GPU

[05-Apr-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you get the right version? Iâ€™ll post the link...

[05-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> They say 115w on the spec sheet.

[05-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> I got on the "monkins" github

[05-Apr-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Do you have cheap electricity for those systems?

[05-Apr-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> 7 cents. They've been pretty borderline blah for a while... So been mining to hold

[05-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You couldnâ€™t even brake even with those rates...

[05-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Unless you want to mine and HODL the coins speculating on a double in value

[05-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Indeed. Ive had then for a long time. They were doing great before. For now I'm just not selling what I'm mining on my CPUs.

[05-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can always mine for ideological reasons

[05-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> But Verus being 50/50 PoW/PoS, it may feel better to "buy" an amount and then sweetening  the pot with pow rewards for even more stake.

[05-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> So I cannot get that ccminer going at all... It doesn't make ccminer.exe

[05-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing...

[05-Apr-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Yah

[05-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> What linux?

[05-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Ubuntu

[05-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got only Ubuntu in VM... no mining on that....

[05-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Ubuntu might be missing necessary lib.

[05-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Ive built many other miners before. This one just not wanting to go.

[05-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> I installed the libraries as well. Goes through process of build.sh but no ccminer.exe

[05-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Now I wouldnâ€™t expect to see an ***.exe*** in Linux, but ok

[05-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I understand what you mean

[05-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ðŸ˜„

[05-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Right. Well the main "ccminer" file. Just isn't being built up

[05-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Anyone got a compiled version lying around?

[05-Apr-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> do you like to be hacked?

[05-Apr-19 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Apr-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, unfortunately Iâ€™m not the right man to help with compiling the miner, so if anyone else would like to step in... Be my guest...

[05-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763

Hey all! One last vote for the @VerusCoin physical coin. Should it be silver or gold?
Twitter

[05-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 100% on silver!!!

[05-Apr-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> I like the silver, too.

[05-Apr-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth do you know the "exact" alloy used for the silver coin? I'm thinking about electro plating it myself

[05-Apr-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Thoskk the coating itself i'm not sure. The base material is a zinc alloy

[05-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> the coating would be more important for electro plating. But I can have a look myself when I have it.

[05-Apr-19 10:58 PM] ! |ðŸ†‰ðŸ…¿ðŸ…¾ðŸ…¾ðŸ…».ðŸ…²ðŸ…°| ! - crackers#9719
whats the proper algo for versus? There is haraka, minato and x18 added on the ccminer code... but....

[05-Apr-19 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Don't quite get the question, but the current algo is Verushash 2.0

[05-Apr-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Which I presume is Haraka V2 heavy.

[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> My pool-side average actually looks better than reported. So that's good... says 9 MH on my system per CPU but pool sees 10 MH average over the last ~12 hours.

[06-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Time to chuck in the rest then...ðŸ¤‘

[06-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It will fluctuate a bit, @sundownz, depending on the difficulty... eg mine fluctuates between 16-18 on average...

[06-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> @zpajk lol 'haraka 2 heavy'

[06-Apr-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @zpajk There is a lot going on in the Verus hashing algo, but I think the most heavy innerloop happens in __verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() , see https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/blob/master/nheqminer/crypto/verus_clhash.cpp  for the code. There is a lot of haraka stuff happening too, but only one Haraka per inner hash and one call to __verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() which is where most of the heavy CPU happens. They use a lot of Intel SIMD intrinic functions, which are basically integrated functionality inside newer (2012 and later usually) CPUs - these functions are super efficient on the CPU which is why CPUs are better than GPUs on Verus.

[06-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @zpajk Per hash there is (simplified explanation, mind you ðŸ˜ƒ ) first a Haraka 512 with a zero roundkey, then a call to verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() which has a heavy loop with 32 iterations (see the link) and then there is a second Haraka 512 with a rondkey that uses the hash writer buffer. There are other stuff going on with VerusHash per hash, but that's the heavy stuff I think. @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining can correct me if I'm wrong ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Apr-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> u missed out. after the first 512haraka hash on the header from the pool. the large mutating round key is created by chaining together 522 x haraka256 hashes to fill it up

[06-Apr-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> but the large key can be used many times as it's before the nonce is applied

[06-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining Yes, but the initial stuff is done only once, that's why I left that part out from my explanation.

[06-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The initial building is done only once per job, then there are 1 million hashes, each of these hashes has 1) haraka 512 with zero roundkey, 2) call to verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() , and then 3) call to haraka 512 using the hashwriter buffer as a roundkey. Something like that ... ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Apr-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> the first haraka zero is only Done once

[06-Apr-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Ok

[06-Apr-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> each hash starts with the same round key.  same haraka 512 zero final hash

[06-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> that's what's transferred to the gpu on gpu miner

[06-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I though you had to run Haraka 512 with a zero roundkey at the start of every hash on the current hash. I'll look into it again.

[06-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> no

[06-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> it's just done to create a 512bit hash

[06-Apr-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> which is then used to make the large round key

[06-Apr-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> kk

[06-Apr-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @zpajk To conclude, I think that if the very complex VerusHash v2 is "heavy" on anything, then it's the Intel SIMD intrinsic functions. More precisely, _mm_clmulepi64_si128, _mm_shuffle_epi8, _mm_aesenc_si128 (that's the Haraka 128 SIMD function), _mm_unpacklo_epi32, _mm_unpackhi_epi32, and finally _mm_mulhrs_epi16.

[06-Apr-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining

[06-Apr-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> These functions are called repeatetly every hash.

[06-Apr-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> luckily ARM  has intrinsic too..  pmull == clmulepi64. and aes .. which is why the rockxhip gets  1mh/s and the raspberry pi without them is 60kh/s
