[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If the attacker cashes out, what does he care of the value of the coin? He didn't to begin with.

[13-Jan-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It seems to me that pow has more incentives to drive the coin forward. 1. Big investors in the coin will want there to be lots of powerful miners to protect their investment and transactions. 2. Big miners will want to put work into securing the network in order to protect their investment on hardware and the currency they want to sell. 3. New casual users of the coin will use a coin with lots of people incentives to protect it. But yeah, if their is not enough incentives from time to time, then they can suffer attacks. But obviously I'm a noob in this and I'm interested in seeing how this pos works.

[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> cant send my funds

[13-Jan-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @rptr try to divide the transfer into smaller ones

[13-Jan-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @rptr that means you likely need to rescan. you can do that by starting the daemon again, either by restarting Agama or the CLI, and when you do, if Agama, select "Activate coin" the long way and choose "daemon param: rescan" as a drop down option on native

[13-Jan-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @jl777c The purpose of an attack is to gain profit - most often by stealing from an exchange via a double spend. They spend to the first exchange, then mine enough to cause a reorg in which they omit this transaction, and as such may now spend it again to another exchange. It's not only really, really likely to completely shatter trust in a coin - even if people hold it up, it's clear that the coin is not safe. The effect is pretty much catastrophic on success.

[13-Jan-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Didn't seem to affect eth classic much, at least temporarily

[13-Jan-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @Gloryman Was there an attack which managed to spend to an exchange, successfully extract the money in another form, and then cause a reorg to undo this and do it a second time to a different exchange with the same result?

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> This article says they gave it or some of it back?

[13-Jan-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Possible white hat hacker?

[13-Jan-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Or maybe they had principles and just had it out for a single exchange and when it was all over paid back the first?

[13-Jan-19 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> If the successful exploitation of a coin resulting in massive monetary damage from a coin doesn't completely destroy people's faith in it...

[13-Jan-19 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> ... well, I don't think we need to worry about solving such complex problems as decentralized finance, simply because it's clear humanity is too damned stupid to continue to survive for much longer.

[13-Jan-19 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well.. It is a shame people don't value decentralization as much as they probably should, especially since it's what got us here to begin with but these aren't the same people here. Those ones who made it all happen aren't the ones who will abandon a project simply over what a chart says or support a centralized operation without even knowing it

[13-Jan-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> No, no - that's not the issue... it's so, so much worse.

[13-Jan-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But I do also believe that they will be the first to scatter when things go wrong, leaving more of the true believers to refine what's left

[13-Jan-19 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> They just watched a system they're trusting with their finances just get publically defrauded to the tune of more money than they can hope to ever make... and then continue to use it, thinking it won't ever happen to them.

[13-Jan-19 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is foolish

[13-Jan-19 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> That's insanity.

[13-Jan-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can't speak for them but it is true that this field has attracted it's fair share of unsavory folks since money became a priority over personal freedom

[13-Jan-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That doesn't mean it will all fall apart- the benefit of a decentralized process

[13-Jan-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> I like this fact. I want the people who steal from others for a living trying to break it. If they succeed, we ought to know.

[13-Jan-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> There should be more people working toward a common mutually beneficial goal than there would be against it

[13-Jan-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> That's the beauty of this system... people don't have to get along nor collaborate to still be working toward the safety and security of the same system... just because they want to make money off doing so. 😛

[13-Jan-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If they succeed in a sense they have rewarded themselves for exploiting a flaw that shouldn't have been there. It's unfortunate that people's money have to be casualty but at the same time shouldn't they know the risks going in and the experimental nature

[13-Jan-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I guess I'm playing devil's advocate in a sense in that I wouldnt hope for a worst case but it should always be accounted for

[13-Jan-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It doesn't help that people get dumped on for even trying to discuss flaws in the current system

[14-Jan-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @Godballz No, I meant

[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> Mining.

[14-Jan-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> Because, the thing is...

[14-Jan-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> If you can mine so much better than everyone else...

[14-Jan-19 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> ... it's makes a lot more sense to play by the rules and get paid a shitton.

[14-Jan-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @miketout Also, you may know this already, but I just wanna make sure you *really* get what I meant about carry-less multiply. It's basically an instruction to accelerate performing operations inside a finite field of degree 2. To give you some sort of idea... a partially-optimized multiplication inside the finite field 2^4 which I needed, I implemented in a total of 26 gates.

[14-Jan-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> everyone isn’t in it for the money.  and every attack is not just about money.

[14-Jan-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> Average delay was... well, there wasn't really any to speak of.

[14-Jan-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @John Westbrook Wow, that's actually not only true, but something very few realize.

[14-Jan-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> Indeed - everyone has a price, but this price is not always money.

[14-Jan-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> 😃

[14-Jan-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> However - the system is designed to leverage the greed of the masses to get them to help secure it against attack.

[14-Jan-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> can’t remember off the top of my head but there was a chain totally obliterated without any monetary gain in sight

[14-Jan-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I think it’s mentioned in the dPoW whitepaper

[14-Jan-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> Humans simply have a lot of trouble getting along well enough to collaborate for long periods... the longer the timeframe, the more unstable the situation becomes. This bypasses the problem by causing people to independently work to the benefit of their monetary system - by leveraging their greed, which humanity could never run out of.

[14-Jan-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Not necessarily about leveraging greed, I think that’s a high accelerant of a much more balanced trade and exchange mechanism built into human nature

[14-Jan-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I disagree 😃

[14-Jan-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> But I think you’re right in that you can identify examples of that version of people

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So I'm guessing that now, we aren't going Cryptopia lol.. Honestly, why not KuCoin?

[16-Jan-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's not about price, at all.
I think, being around for 6 to 7 months, we've developed a very strong & very talented community. 
At some point though, it would benefit the project, bc of the exposure. We would be on a major exchange & also be on CMC. I think these are two things that most projects do. 
This only my personal opinion. And I feel comfortable posting it here and seeing what others say, bc there are some very knowledgeable people in this discord.

[16-Jan-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I don't know that we aren't going to Cryptopia. they are busy right now, and I expected to hear from them last week. Maybe this is why I didn't. They still have the 2 BTC listing fee. We are about to post about Crypto-Bridge, who would like to list us for 2 BTC, which was the original price when we applied some time ago vs. their 3 BTC price now, and they also have CMC listing, which along with Stex, would qualify us for CMC

[16-Jan-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @miketout Cryptopia will probs close down after the last couple days....

[16-Jan-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jan-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jan-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout  I'm more than willing to donate to whatever the community thinks is best, if anything. 
Honestly Mike, I do not think KuCoin is more than Crypto Bridge. If it's just a little bit, it's worth it. Bc
CryptoBridge is a DEX. It's not so easy to use.

[16-Jan-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> Crypto-Bridge......

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> ??

[16-Jan-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I still don't see the point in spending $7,000 to be listed on another no name exchange when there is very little trading being done on the exchanges vrsc is already on

[16-Jan-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig there is a question of both the exchange and its reach/future potential as well as CMC listing, which requires a second CMC exchange. I think it's a question for the community, and community response will likely determine the final outcome. CryptoBridge is actually interesting in light of the Cryptopia hack, as it is a dex where you keep your own keys locally.

[16-Jan-19 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I've used quite a few DEXs and they suck more than they don't. Nice in theory, poor in execution. Also, incredibly low volume

[16-Jan-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Idex has been the best of the ones I have used, and it's pretty much dead now

[16-Jan-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It's not my money, but if it were up to me I would rather see that money spent on ways that will improve Verus. How much has already been spent on listings-- I seem to recall there have been multiple fees paid without actually getting listed, and that most of the listings that actually happened didn't even cost anything?
