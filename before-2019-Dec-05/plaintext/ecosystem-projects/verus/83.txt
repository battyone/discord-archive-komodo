[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> CPU is most welcome in my books , ill just have to put my gpu‚Äôs back on something else while we wait for the work to be done for them on verus algo - NO MORE ALGO 1 üòé

[12-Dec-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @stretcher83 I'll donate you some of my 1950X threadripper hash! Until the GPUS are up and running.

[12-Dec-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Gloryman you are a legend bud üëçüèº, but i would feel like i would be taking advantage of your good nature though , im used to going slow on the mining side of things , i was over the moon when we finally got gpu‚Äôs mining on verus ( i got a big jump up in hash rate compared to my small cpu i had mining ) but im happy to downsize my hash back to cpu if it helps us even out the network hash a bit better , i really appreciate your offer , and i know you are sincere, but i would rather you use your full cpu hash rate to build up your own bag of verus coins , especially after you sold your last lot üòâüòÜ, iv got a few coins to tide me over for now , i had an amazing time in the beginning when we was all solo mining with our cpu‚Äôs , i think with your good cpu, you will have a really good time mining verus after the fork , wether thats going to be solo mining or more likely just cpu pool mining with much lower net hash .

[12-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> guess its time to bust out my old 5ghz fx 6300 setup to keep my hash up when the algo changes

[12-Dec-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> YES CPU!!! Back to basics,  one cpu one vote one node !

[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I thought decentralization was to support permissionless system, but I see many people worreid about it actually and trying to ban it changing algos so that people in charge will have  controll over permisonless system üòõ @miketout

[12-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> what I mean if you believe in decentralization because it is permisionless why not include mining in the same thinking, while it's a core part of it

[12-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> meaning - leave the race for faster devices to the companies and parties wanting to participate in it ?

[12-Dec-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if you want to have more wide distribution, maybe time to start thinking as decentrlaizaed profile as the basics? if people/companies got  profiles in the system / recorder somwhere in the core? / it could be easier to distribute mining ? by profiles instead of just devices ?

[12-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> it will be interesting experiment and sooner or later there will be distributed profile, working in analogical way google page rank based on links - people will confirm each other to gain trust, but for sure new challenges will arise to discriminate fakes and abusers. Again it will come to the core like devices parts and safety, for example if GPS can be trusted then you could discriminate fakes by location / as long as this cannot be faked, or measured by different parameters too. Or even expect decentralized profiles to interact with reality around, fake profiles (which are based  on thousands of other fake profiles) could have it hard to generate interactions recorded in the network (example someone from the network visiting my office, so I record that event).

[12-Dec-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Maybe there should be a constant fee per device if possible? So that if one entity using many devices pay more fees?

[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I personally don't have an fpga but forking to remove them from the network seems kinda centralizing. Chosing whom to favor, in this case, GPU miners, because they are your biggest supporters? Not sure I understand the whole thought processes behind this @miketout

[12-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Originally this was supposed to be only CPU minable. Then, by request and acceptance, a GPU miner arose. That's when I stopped mining Verus.  Now there are even bigger hashers then GPUs from what I read and it is decided to fork.

[12-Dec-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Its funny that everyone throws out the word "decentralized" with favoratism to forking to delute fpga hashrate. If that's that's the thought process, fork from GPU algo too. Make it truley decetralized lmao ( forking in no way shape or form is dectrentralized, it's favortism and more centralized then not )

[12-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Currently the fpgas that are making up approximately 75% of the hash rate and probably more are causing the centralisation. Also, fpgas are reducing the growth of the community. CPU mining makes verus coin less, not more centralised.

[12-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> it's a trade-off

[12-Dec-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> What is the most important property of a hashing algo? I would say - power efficiency. To equalize power efficiency across all types of mining hw, that's the ultimate goal. And I think Mike&team is doing the best they can, to reach this goal.

[12-Dec-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> Do not try to be "something-resistant" or "this-hw-only". That is the road to endless loop of forks.

[12-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @NWhiskeyTango So the most decentralized is to never change anything ever again once it's launched? :P
Anyway, #announcements explains what the teams considers best. There's nothing strange to it. It's how blockchains work. The work is open source and can be forked to whomever's liking. But for obvious reasons you'd do best in following the development team's fork, and in that case the development team can be considered the centralized part of a project. And lastly, it's not about banning fpga:s, it's about leveling the playing field in this point in time, mostly until fpgas become more common(decentralized). (As I interpret it)

[12-Dec-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> cpu cpu cpu cpu little gpu.....lol....üòù

[12-Dec-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> @Gloryman i do not disagree that CPU mining would level the playing field. I think you misread read me. What I said was that I, a cpu miner, did not consider fork an option when GPU came into town. But because GPU miners are in abundance and the biggest support group of verus, the squeeky wheel gets the grease.

[12-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I guess the simplest way to put this is, i didnt bitch and moan when the GPU miner came along. Requesting a fork would very biased. The decision now is GPU biased. Period. It's really that simple. To "level" the playing field between fpga gpu and cpu ultimately = enhancing GPU ability.

[12-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @NWhiskeyTango The fork is not against GPU miners. It is just about getting the fork done quicker, instead of waiting for GPU miner's support.

[12-Dec-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> GPU and CPU were roughly matched, neither side had any 50x perf gain

[12-Dec-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I think , when gpu miners came on board for verus , they/we all did it openly, and we all focused on making the project and community better, when the fpga‚Äôs found a way of mining verus, they chose the opposite route, they did it all secretly, swerving the open community that we had all built up, and then they started to pump and dump , which has had ill effects on not just the price of the verus coin but also the community, i think if they decided to just be open to us all with the fpga miner, yes some of us would have been a bit miffed off that the net hash and difficulty was about to go up , but i think we would have worked through it and added a new lot of members to our community, as it is now , i dont see the fpga crew trying to better the community and the project , i just see them as still being secretive and deceptive towards the community, i totally get your point of view NWhiskeyTango , i think its a shame now with everything thats gone on , we have two separate verus communities, one with cpu and gpu , and the other with fpga‚Äôs , i wish we could go back and try it again a different way , a more open way where we would then have 1 big friendly verus community with fpga‚Äôs and cpu and gpu miners all working together , the proper way , i still have high hopes that some fpga miners will openly join our community and work with us for the future of the project , fingers crossed

[12-Dec-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @NWhiskeyTango Yes the goal is decentralization. Not who complains loudest. The issue isnt about stopping anybody and as gloryman said, it is mostly about leveling the playing field and as jl777c said fpga currently have over 50x lead meaning more coins going to a few. This leads to centralization. A group decision is not centralization. If you've been following in here lately, you will find the community is very much united on most of these matters and from the frequent updates and inquiries by Mike and the dev team it leads me to believe that they are flexible and open minded. Who knows, stick around, that cpu might prove useful!

[12-Dec-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I understand where you guys are coming from.  Not being particularly knowledgeable about the dynamics of mining and all of the different strategies, I don't see how FPGAs could ever be a part of the Verus community.  The goal here is to keep processors of  any type as equitable as possible.  This goes against what the FPGA is supposed to do -- do something extraordinarily fast.  Right?  So with this in mind, I would expect that once the fork comes out, maintain parity between the CPU and GPU as before and lock out the FPGAs enough that there is no incentive to use them anymore.  FPGAs can target other coins.   Or maybe there's something in between where a new algo requires CPU users to get any cheap GPU to use functions that make it impossible for FPGAs?  I don't know, just wondering actually.

[12-Dec-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Ok I get the secrecy part, that's f'd up. But point on CPU vs GPU, theirs no CPU farms mining verus boys.

[12-Dec-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Maybe your 580 does what my I7 can do or whatever. But your 580 rig, multipliedx lord knows how many of them are out there, blows away the average joe's cpu. There is no equal playing field there either. So yes, make GPU mining verus profitable again.

[12-Dec-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Not trying to cause a comotion, really, just surprised this is happening only now

[12-Dec-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hash per watt, that is the most important metric for a miner seeking returns, no? Hash per watt, I personally have found cpu and gpu quite relative. I still mine with my cpu.

[12-Dec-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> @Godballz that makes sense

[12-Dec-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well actually I mine with my cpu and gpu. I like that this is an option.

[12-Dec-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Well good for you. So many "projects" claim to be 1 thing, then change when it benefits them.

[12-Dec-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Since everyone has an opinion against fpga, and I never complained before you GPU miners came on the scene. I figured I'd join the fight, even if I am riding solo.

[12-Dec-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Why is it a fight?

[12-Dec-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I think voicing your opinion is the best we can all do , and then maybe we can get the best points of view from everyone and maybe we will all get what we want , i know, iv got very high hopes üòÄ

[12-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Agree

[12-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I just never spoke up before. Figure now is a great time more then ever

[12-Dec-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Fact is they decided to change (from cpu only to cpu/gpu). They are deciding to change again and will continue to do so. This I don't support. If your  going to change, then go back to initial intent. Otherwise, your just delaying another change. Countless wasted dev time. Just my 2 cents

[12-Dec-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Read the white paper again it always stated that asic/fpga would likely happen sooner or later

[12-Dec-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Meh

[12-Dec-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Ok that is your reply to a valid point

[12-Dec-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Meh

[12-Dec-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Mine whatever you want

[12-Dec-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> If you go back and read all the material and posts from the team you will understand that you are wrong on that statement. Mike always said it was CPU only at start-iup, and that it would take a while before GPU would become viable. He never said GPU would stay out, and he also said that sooner or later any succesfull coin must expect more powerfull centralized hardware to try to gain advantage..

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> "From the very beginning of its operation, Verus operated with a dual proof of stake /
proof of work mechanism for all participants. Verus mining with the VerusHash algorithm,
as of this point, is a CPU-only algorithm, designed with a Haraka512 V2 [30] core to be
quantum secure and to maximize performance on modern CPUs. While VerusHash was
designed to be CPU-optimized and did not begin life with GPU or ASIC miners capable of
beating CPUs in its mining, the Verus developers have no illusions that it is possible someone
might develop either a GPU or ASIC-based miner that could be meaningfully superior to
CPUs."

I have been following this project since before launch. I read the available docs before launch. The team has done nothing but overdeliver on their promises so far, and they are staying true to the vision.
I believe you need the history lesson since you can't be bothered to check your facts before you throw criticism at the team.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I was listening to a podcast the other day and, what they said made sense.. That really Vertcoin is getting 51% attacked, bc it was made to resist Asics etc.. It seems like resisting it, puts a target on you.

[12-Dec-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I agree with  @Cragorn as well. The devs have done nothing but overperform

[12-Dec-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> Just my two cents. Why not look at what Nexus did and make different hashing channels for different types of devices. CPUs have their own hashing channels and then GPUs also have their own hashing channels so they don't have to compete against each other. Of course you can always group the fpgas with the gpus or make third channel.

[12-Dec-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> I'm personally very interested in your project but I'm not able to find all the answers I've been looking for which is a bigger concern to me than the current one you guys are dealing with.
