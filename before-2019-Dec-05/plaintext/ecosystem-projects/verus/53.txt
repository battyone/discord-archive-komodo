[dscrdvrsc] <BlockTech> sorry i should ask that in mining room  <-

[06-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> I looked at atlant

[06-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> And made a commmwnt.

[06-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> There‚Äôs no way in my mind that project succeeds.

[06-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Regulatory practices in the lending industry do not allow for crowdfunding on a level like this without considerable paperwork.   Bot for investors and regional specific lending laws.

[06-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> One problem loan and the whole project goes up in smoke.

[06-Nov-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> I‚Äôm new to this but in my 20 years experience and 65 years as a family working in loans.... they‚Äôre dreaming.

[06-Nov-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> It‚Äôs a scam essentially.    I would Guarantee the company is also skimming ‚Äúservicing fees‚Äù on the loans too in the form of rate spread participation.

[06-Nov-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Seems shady 100%

[06-Nov-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> I‚Äôve seen smaller companies go down for the smallest things.

[06-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> No way this project makes it.  Not yet.   Maybe in ten years when regulatory practices allow for this type of investing.

[06-Nov-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Sad that they have so many people fooled.   

Who knows maybe I‚Äôm the fool but I‚Äôll gladly apologize with hat in hand if they last more than 5 years.

[06-Nov-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> You look great for 65 @FishyGuts, no homo

[06-Nov-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> üòÇ

[06-Nov-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> 45 years for my pops - and 20 for me.   Technically almost 40 for me.    I‚Äôve been helping him sign loans by distracting customers and brokers for him since I was 2 years old. üòú

[06-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BlockTech> Nice analyse Fishy ^^, hope you'll save some people from being scammed ^^

[06-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Maybe txbit will DQ them üòâ

[06-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> ‚ÄúSorry, no busted securities scams‚Äù

[06-Nov-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> @BlockTech unfortunatley, noone who has already bought will listen. üòõ

[06-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MMMCCCXXXIII> hmmm interesting to see that the VoteCoin (VOT) also activated Sapling on 29th October

[06-Nov-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MMMCCCXXXIII> I thought that project was done, guess I was wrong

[06-Nov-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Never heard of them

[06-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mikeydof3> where is my sapling address? i think i am missing some info i am just running the verus lite wallet can some one  point me in the right direction ps it took me 4 days to get my vega's running so i am a little wore out

[06-Nov-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @mikeydof3 lite mode is fast to load, but it doesn‚Äôt support z-transactions. You‚Äôll need to run the wallet in native mode to get a sapling address. You can export your lite mode private key and import that or the pass phrase directly into your native mode wallet, so you have it there as well

[06-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mikeydof3> @miketout  so i need a coin to activate it  a komodo coin is that correct

[06-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> No. If you have the Verus enhanced Agama, it supports Verus in native mode. It sounds like you might not have Agama from https://veruscoin.io . Komodo Agama only supports Verus in lite mode

[06-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> @verus - You keep doing you!  Don't fret!

[06-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Moral of the story - don't be honest.

[06-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Hire a botnet.

[06-Nov-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> True

[06-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Does atlant get elevated by txbit, or does txbit get cheapened by atlant

[07-Nov-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Nov-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nmnm> true. i cant believe they were in the first place by 2-3 thousands votes

[08-Nov-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <chriiisss> @Godballz im not trying to use the calculator. People's worls is better than that calculator

[08-Nov-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well then it depends on hashrate but I'd say the calculator is pretty accurate to what I've been getting at 1.2ghs

[08-Nov-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oldboy> you can go to the cpu hashrate room and plug what people are getting into the calculator

[08-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Oh, I though he was asking about staking.

[08-Nov-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> regarding blockfolio

[08-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> any idea why the prices goes like -100%?

[08-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> :/

[08-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> it doesnt show me how much is in usd

[08-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Sosky you can select which feed you use, Barterdex or DigitalPrice. Digital Price has enough volume to get a correct price.

[08-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> oooh, ok, thank you

[08-Nov-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
