[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> @Patrick ManBearPig aacoin is credible,some their staff in QQ channel look nice,i can trust them.

[14-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Whale | aacoin.com> Today's staking reward will be delayed for half an hour, tomorrow will be normal,very sorry.

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> On a side note, Ginasis Mining Pools offer pooled staking. Be it isnt automated and must be in multiples of 100 to keep the math simple for a peasant like myself. All addresses are provided so there is full transparency of earnings.  The fees are on 1%-2% ATM. There is now a small handfull of active members involved that should be able to confirm our service. üòÉ

[14-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @That_Guy8  link to your discord?

[14-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> That work for you?

[14-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @That_Guy8  No. Can you DM me it

[14-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> @miketout much voice about the next algo is good for cpu or gpu,but I think we should have both,in the past times ,we can see there is alot miners use Nvida,we can't leave them away,so the problem is the new algo is for nvidia or amd,I prefer Nvida,becuase that card almost everyone have

[14-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> gpu farms and cpu farms we can know alot ,so next is how strong your device is

[14-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> then how many coins you can get ,that is good for every miners

[14-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Earlier today I was thinking the opposite. ^^ NVIDIA users got the first available gpu miner on the current algo. I was hoping @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops would try to give AMD some margins this time around. ;D But jokes aside, there shouldn't be any need to worry, equal opportunity should be about the same whether or not it's just cpu or both cpu and gpu available.

[14-Dec-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> the AMD miner runs fine on nvidia... so there is the possibility that we can release the AMD first, but hopefully release them together will be best

[14-Dec-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> AMD first is best because I own them. üòÇ üòâ

[14-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Shocking

[14-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I vote for equal hash rate/power

[14-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> CPU only

[14-Dec-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> cpu

[14-Dec-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout . I'm not asking when the new algo is exactly, but in more general terms, what's your target timeframe. Days, weeks or months? in 2018 or 2019 .. etc?

[14-Dec-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney it is likely final right now and working great üòÉ we are working on an announcement for significant GPU and FPGA bounties for devs who can make an open implementation that can beat CPUs. Release should be in the next 1-3 days, I believe. It is much more comprehensively designed for CPU advantage than VerusHash 1.0, which was relying only on the Haraka core for that purpose.

[14-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> @miketout solo mine?

[14-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @basti i plan to update the nheqminer for pool mining before activation. we are working on a number of things for support.

[14-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Great job for sorting this FPGA issue out quickly. I'm so excited about this new fork.

[14-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks @Gloryman üòÉ me too

[14-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The cpu miner will come out shortly after the fork right?

[14-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> No specific date. I will make every effort to have it out before activation, so pools should be fine.

[14-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Oh sweet. So we put the miner on and it works only when verus is activated or it mines the verus1.0 too?

[14-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> Yes baby!

[14-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> CPU. Love it

[14-Dec-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Way to go team Verus!

[14-Dec-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> komodo running sapling today and verus announcing verus 2.0

[14-Dec-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> amazing

[14-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <technopato> @miketout any adverse affect for staking with current version 4.0h wallets?
Edit: I mean after the fork to verushash 2.0, or will a new wallet be required also?

[15-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Due to a fork I‚Äôd imagine all new wallets are going to be required @technopato

[15-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> @miketout thank you for your amazing contribution to the komodo ecosystem, re:sapling

[15-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <technopato> @Ginasis Mining Pools thanks.. how about staking? Is this affected?

[15-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman There will be either a new nheqminer or ccminer, or both that should be able to mine through along with the wallet for solo-mining, and new pool software to support the new block version and hash. It's likely that there will no longer be much of a speed difference between nheqminer, the wallet, and ccminer on CPUs with VerusHash 2.0, but Chris will almost certainly keep the optimizations that are there now and still apply in the final step, so if there is a ccminer option, it should have at least a little more hash power.
@technopato all wallets will need to be upgraded to be able to process the new hash for the blocks on the chain. staking functionality will not change at all.
@Godballz @ph03nix and all thank you üòÉ

[15-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <technopato> @miketout thanks much for the clarity!

Congratulations @KomodoPlatform  Ecosystem and community for the biggest hardfork event going smoothly and upgrading to Sapling simultaneously. Biggest day in Komodo project's history. ü§©üòé

[15-Dec-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you @grewalsatinder , and congratulations to Komodo for activating the upgrade across all projects (I think) across the whole Komodo ecosystem!

[15-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> actually 2 projects on exchanges, decided to delay updating, so this wasnt a forced hardfork across the ecosystem. any project could have opted out. they run the latest code, just without sapling activation, which is backward compatible with the non-updated daemons

[15-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Any news on btch for 12/15?

[15-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763

already activated

[15-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> How can I mine?

[15-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> And stake

[15-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> those changes are not yet, it is "only" the sapling hardfork for now

[15-Dec-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c congrats buddy. Looking forward to seeing how it does.

[15-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> Can I run the Verus version of Agama and the Komodo Agama at the same time?

I assume Verus version won't support latest KMD updates yet?

[15-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> (double post in community support)

[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Random: Just saw on LinkedIn that Mike worked for GRC before Microsoft. That's so cool. I love Security Now on TWIT üòÅ

[15-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @ver_User you can't run two agama instances at once

[15-Dec-18 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <66tbird> What is the actual Aacion staking reward?  Just wondering what to expect.

[15-Dec-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @66tbird it is a % of your stake compared to the total aacoin pool and rewards being won by that pool...minus 1% fee on reward payouts

[15-Dec-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> what wallet is needed to support the fork ?

[15-Dec-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> im running 0.4.0a-beta do i need to change ?

[15-Dec-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> and if so do i just delete the old agama directory in %appdata% and run new wallet and paste wallet.dat

[15-Dec-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> its OK done it and worked fine

[15-Dec-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> funds are SUFU üòÉ

[15-Dec-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bassliner the release for the fork is not out yet. we are in final testing for release today, but the upgrade process will be the same. We will announce when the fork update is posted.

[15-Dec-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ver_User the newest Verus-enhanced Agama upgrade that we are testing today for release will include both the new hash algorithm as well as support for (edit: I‚Äôve been informed that I made a mistake, and it is MOST) other Komodo ecosystem coins.

[15-Dec-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> ok thanks for clarifying

[15-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Also, as we have enabled a multi-daemon wallet, we should have no compatibility issues with other Komodo coins going forward. We will need to add them as new ones start in the ecosystem.

[15-Dec-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> @miketout  $ARRR support also

[15-Dec-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bassliner yes, $ARRR also

[15-Dec-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MMMCCCXXXIII> A new algorithm?

[15-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Yes. A fun new algorithm intended to close the hardware performance gap üòÉ

[15-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> hope its good

[15-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> Very pumped on the new algo also and dying to take screen shot before and after implementation and watch that hash-rate plummet!!!!  brick the fpgas

[16-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Since I implied the release may happen today in this channel, an update... we are still working on release testing. No issues yet, but some testing has been slow across platforms and with this change, we want to be sure. We expect the release this weekend. Activation is still expected for Sunday the 23rd.

[16-Dec-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Just saw your messages... so releasing today but not swapping until the 23rd?

[16-Dec-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not releasing until we finish all tests. there will be a couple improvements that I'm working to slip in as the tests are in progress, and we're considering adding the portable version if it's done tomorrow. right now, shooting for release this weekend

[16-Dec-18 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> activation still targeting the 23rd

[16-Dec-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Awesome. Love your work.

[16-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey @miketout . I'm a bit confused. What is the difference between release and activation?

[16-Dec-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Gloryman release is so everyone can have the appropriate software for when the changes are activated

[16-Dec-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Ginasis Mining Pools thanks

[16-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Is there a decision on whether it will be cpu only at first or likely there will be a GPU miner straight from the start? Pools likely to be ready or solo?

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @jonske1 I think it was mentioned that we should have pools ready and GPU may be ready on day 1

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> but probs not a optimized miner just an initial release id imagine

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> as goes for the CPU too, would probs be room for improvement down the track

[16-Dec-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Cool. No change since I last stopped by. Cheers.

[16-Dec-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> So, when the software is released, we go on to the new software and it will work. Then when it is activated, the old software wont work for mining, right?

[16-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just woke up me, didnt read everything and got a bit ahead of myself, i though it was getting activated today but i see its 23rd. Activation üòÅ

[16-Dec-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Will the old boot strap still work on the new fork , i assume we will all need to do a full blockchain resync with the new software release ?

[16-Dec-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Generally we should not need to resync the full chain for a fork

[16-Dec-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Oh , even better , üëçüèº thanks @Ginasis Mining Pools

[16-Dec-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Gloryman sound about right

[17-Dec-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I guess this is why I heard my neighbor's girlfriend last night screaming 'fork me, fork me...'  Or something like that.

[17-Dec-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> will VERUS wallet diverge from Agama wallet? latest Agama is 0.3.somethin and VERUS reads 0.4

[17-Dec-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> @miketout if you need any help testing, I volunteer. I have about 80 CPUs

[17-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I can test threadripper if you need too

[17-Dec-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @LocoMB they diverged a long time ago, and we have been working to keep them generally in sync

[17-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have had coinbase shielding, zero knowledge messaging along with private transactions and display of private transactions as well as other things for a while
