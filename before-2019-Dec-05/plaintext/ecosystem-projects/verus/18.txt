[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @DaveArcher  Block height is simply the length of the Verus chain , the total number of blocks . Hash rate is a measurement of mining activity, basically one guess at winning a block. The hash rate of your miners can be compared to the total network hash rate to estimate the likelihood of your winning a particular block. See FAQ for how to do that calculation.

[15-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @stretcher83 your expected results would be one block about every 10 days at ~700 Gh/s net hash rate

[dscrdvrsc] <hastrup> in my agama wallet i have 84 wif keys witch one is the right one or are all them right??

[15-Jul-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @hastrup Right for what?

[15-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Your Agama wallet starts with a pool of addresses and keys.  The wallet mines each reward to a different address and a different privkey.  They are all correct in the sense that they are all supposed to be there.

[15-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you need to know which addresses have actually been used then you have to look at each transactions's details.

[15-Jul-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @stretcher83  I feel your pain, it's some serious hard rock mining down in the Verus mines these days with the hash rate growing. But take heart., more miners should mean that the coins we have are more likely to be worth something.

[15-Jul-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JoeCrypto> Just hope the earlier miners don‚Äôt dump  at cheap prices.  All the immature coins will be worth nothing.

[15-Jul-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> I think the time locked blocks will work to diminish that phenomenon of folks cashing out and moving on. I know that I intend to keep on mining Verus , seems to be a great project with big plans.

[15-Jul-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @JoeCrypto With a 50% POS reward... do you really think it would be wise to dump? 

And it's not like miners have that much to recoup in the way of power costs either.

[15-Jul-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> "dump at cheap prices" at one point in time may be a possibility, but then there's 24 months of possible price change for immature blocks...

how many times did btc get dumped at cheap prices!

[15-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And how many ETH miners dumped for a few bucks in 2016 while also complaining that mining ETH was no longer profitable....

[15-Jul-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <regtable> any of you use linux gui? cannot seem to get conected

[15-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> indeed... gosh remembering eth always leads me to "if only" ;)

there was so much pessimism for a while...

I reckon anyone who has any strategic thinking ability at all (which is likely to be anyone who was mining from early) will not be looking to dump, but there may be some loosening of the early coins into the market as they just do have less relative value to early miners/stakers who may feel they have commited enough and might need some money. It will be interesting to see. I guess the counter point needs to be some trading hype and the general awareness campaign that is underway

[15-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> also with more potential liquidity we can talk about higher profile exchanges - it's quite a task to sign up to yet another (unproven) exchange, password, 2fa, deposit etc just for a coin that you might like or might be a good investment... in general people like familiarity and ease of access. I guess it depends what the target market is atm and if it's still focusing on early supporters who get what Verus core values are

[15-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @regtable I could not get the linux GUI wallet (0.3.10) to work. Never connects. Did you check the debug log?

[16-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> If its still not working , check that your cpu has the correct instructions set , eg, aes or avx , i used speccy to find out under the cpu section, if your cpu does not have them you wont be able to mine verus on it , thats my findings so far

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Do we have a development roadmap for the coming future? Git activity seems pretty low, what are the current development priorities for the future?

[17-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> @ok88 as far as I can tell the very recent active bounties program is in order for the devs to spend less time on the community and more time on developing. It's also an indication to me that they acquired near the figures they were expecting from early mining/staking and are now ready to share their proceeds with the community in order to stimulate growth, which was their plan from the beginning. I have also seen comments from miketout that he is busy developing at the moment. 

For the roadmap, I didn't see dates and times exactly, but I saw the different phases they want to implement in the vision paper

[17-Jul-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Maybe, just maybe, the locked coins concept will attract a more disciplined and long range outlook crowd.  That would certainly be nice as profit-miners have taken just about everything else I have down the crapper.

[18-Jul-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom I have had to deal with these kinds of things myself.  Reclassifying contractor/employee relationships is tricky.  It puts the burden for taxation on the employer, but the rules governing intellectual property will probably also be skewed in the employer's favor as any work output from an employee is generally automatically considered the intellectual property of the employer.  I am a professional photographer. As long as I am independent, copyright laws automatically protect me.  If I was classified as a photographer AND an employee I do not have a leg to stand on.  Would not surprise me if the software industry was not cheering this on in secret....

[18-Jul-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Independent contractors would address intellectual property concerns through contracts.  There, the contractor has some room for negotiation.  Not so if an employee.

[18-Jul-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Often photographs and code are works for hire. If you get paid to produce the photos the client owns the photos and at least share the copyright.

[18-Jul-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Works for hire in software often have specific contracts about ownership and copyright.

[18-Jul-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I was looking at the part of it where companies have to. Over all the employment costs they used to avoid. Have an actual employee give more obvious ownership of work product.

[18-Jul-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @jl777c dollar for dollar, I do not think a Ryzen 7 2700 or 2700x can be beat.

[18-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom Work for hire has to be clearly spelled out in the contract if you are an independent contractor.   In the 30+ years I have been shooting architecture I have maybe done 4-5 WFH assignments and they were set up that way due to proprietary information that was in the photos.  Not sure how coding typically works.  For me, the playing surface is clearly slanted in my favor when it comes to IP law.

[18-Jul-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> On another topic... I am rather surprised (but also willing to take advantage...) that the net hash rate is where it is.  Right now... between 500 and 600 Gh/s.  Assuming an average hash rate of the casual CPU miner being about 150 Mh/s (Kaby Lake i5 can do this by itself), that means there are about 4000 computers mining this right now - worldwide.   That is really tiny.   Surprisingly tiny.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @themobi I went to my local Microcenter a couple of weeks ago and bough a Ryzen 7 2700 and an Asus Prime X470 mobo and the pair cost me 380.00 USD.  Threw in 15 bucks for the cheapest keyboard/mouse known to the human race and 40 bucks for a 4G stick of DDR4.   Already had a power supply and SSD.  Total setup was less than 500 bucks.   I have averaged just under a block a day on it and it is hashing at 435-440 Mh/s.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ALL rewards above or equal to 192 VRSC are timelocked for a random time from about 1 month from now to about 2 years and 1 month. The time lock shows as immature coins. When the reward halves in about 8 days to 96 coins per block, there will be no time locks and all rewards will mature in 100 blocks.

[19-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Scrotum Tickler In the slower laptop - have you checked for other processes that might be running?  Are the two CPU's identical or just both i7's?   I have an i7 in one of my old desktops that pulls about 40 mh/s and another doing 230.  The difference there is the generation of the CPU and perhaps some chipset limitations too.

[19-Jul-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> wallet version?

[19-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Scrotum Tickler Just that you check the other running processes and, as @Lil komodo said - wallet versions.  The difference between 0.3.8 and 0.3.9 is not as great as your disparity, but it is pretty close.

[19-Jul-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @Scrotum Tickler: I've had this happen. Are the connection counts the same?

Are they networked via WiFi or ethernet/hard-wired? If the latter, try switching connections between the two and see if the slow hash follows.

Either WiFi or ethernet: You can try:
```ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew```
to get a new lease and see if that is the culprit.

Finally, try stopping Agama on the slow laptop, let it exit completely, shut the machine down (rather than just re-starting), start the machine and than try loading and running Agama again. This has usually worked for me.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> is there an  easy way for GUI to shield coin with a click of button?

[20-Jul-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Gordon Komodo yes, a few clicks. Taken from my #faq-chosen " So, once your coins loose their time lock, in the GUI first generate a private address and then go to the ‚ÄûSend‚Äú screen and use ‚ÄûShield a coinbase transaction‚Äú (will take some time, likely 5 min, but may be up to 20 min, much longer than from a public/transparent address to another). Finally you transfer the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you‚Äôll automatically start staking."
