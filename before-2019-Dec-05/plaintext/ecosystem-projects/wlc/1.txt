remove the space in front of you and you will be automatically sucked into that space. a nuclear mass reactor that hyper drives the object in any direction at almost the speed of light. that is how you time travel forward

[11-Sep-18 11:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
tesla coils joined around the world would give enough energy to drive these devices - a block chain energy grid

too much to explain = except it would take a lot of mass or energy - so a mass/energy repeater would need to be created like poles of a magnet - energy would need to be reused it would circulate around the machine

[12-Sep-18 09:07 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
creating the hole in space that you would arrive in --instantly --

[13-Sep-18 12:15 AM] metaphilibert#0926
So much energy required... Would a nuclear reactor be enough to power it up?
Don't you need an antimatter reactor for these levels of energy?

just to let you know,  WLC has been delisted from Cryptopia because Some WLC community all they do is to seel their free coins in time of crisis

[09-Oct-18 04:11 PM] MR_President#6999
Please withdraw all your wlc from cryptopia and send it to your komodo wallets

[09-Oct-18 04:12 PM] MR_President#6999
as soon as I  get rich I will build the bus...all those who sold their WLC will never get a chance to get into the bus for rats 😃

You are welcome  xRobeSx I will  repeat this once a week to make sure  less people leave their wlc in Cryptopia, And Madmats will do the same via twitter

can't withdraw WLC from cryptopia

[13-Oct-18 10:38 PM] metaphilibert#0926
```Dear metaphilibert,
To clarify our previous email, the date of the coin delisting announcement is 9 October 2018 and trade markets are now closing. The last day the coins will be on the exchange will be 11 November 2018, you have until this date to withdraw any balances to a compatible wallet.
We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.
Kind regards,

The Cryptopia Team```

[13-Oct-18 10:39 PM] metaphilibert#0926
as a quite useless Minister of Exchanges of Wirelesscoin 😟  (as the only one CEX is delisting WLC), I strongly urge everyone to withdraw quickly

[13-Oct-18 10:40 PM] metaphilibert#0926
i was responsible for the first ever KMD assetchain listed on a centralized exchange, i will be responsible for the delisting...
and will forward and fight for your claims about withdrawals (as it seems there is a problem like @SHossain  told here)

[13-Oct-18 10:40 PM] metaphilibert#0926
contacting them, will make an announcement Monday at last

[13-Oct-18 10:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926
HODL to da bus!

[13-Oct-18 10:41 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, wanted to hodl in my wallet

[13-Oct-18 10:42 PM] SHossain#0007

nothing is more understandable,
hope i would be able to help

[13-Oct-18 11:05 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Will ask cryptopia a fair offer to keep WLC listed but I quite doubt they will listen to arguments like "if you maintain KMD you can list all AC's for free as it is the same cli"
Anyway will try

[13-Oct-18 11:09 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I guess volume is the issue, maybe if i can convince them, we could put some volume
if not, hey no problem, it is DEX era no?

[13-Oct-18 11:12 PM] metaphilibert#0926
@MR_President  maybe we need some glorious motivating words from you here

[13-Oct-18 11:14 PM] metaphilibert#0926
and yes, before, i will help them to find some peers as they seem unable to do

Trying to understand what their problem is. 
Now i am just not able to login to check the latest answer of cryptopia support. Because 2FA check fails everytime.
I guess because we just passed saving daylight trigger
what an irony for a coin that will allow us to travel through time

[28-Oct-18 01:49 AM] metaphilibert#0926
ah no  seems it was a pishing attempt  😅 
anyway answer is still  about time

```Hi metaphilibert,

Thanks for contacting Cryptopia.

I've since replied to your other case that was created via email, please note that I have since escalated this to the correct team and they should be in touch within 72 hours.

since then, withdrawals are not allowed, due to unclarified problems

[28-Oct-18 10:21 AM] SHossain#0007
They want to keep all WLC?

[28-Oct-18 11:03 AM] MR_President#6999
Dont worry, you still have 2 weeks, They will not keep any WLC.  Metaphilibert is the one who bought the licence to get WLC in Cryptopia...All the coins that are not claim will go to Metapilibert wallet, Please Metaphilibert  make sure thats the case.  They will not keep a single WLC...I am  travelling  and I am builidng the bus time machine. The reason I dont give any update as I am not time waster of your time , as soon I get the money to build the bus I will. I promise, you have my word of President of Komodo

[28-Oct-18 11:11 AM] MR_President#6999
WLC  will be a success,  WLC will not die  even when I am dead You know why? because  there is a book  and  songs what will be the  trip like and someone in the future  will read it and beleive on it if I am not successful,  but I will try.. once I am rich ....I will make a movie and buy land to build all necessary to build our transpotime21bus

[28-Oct-18 03:53 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Hem not sure they will send me the unclaimed WLC. Will ask them and I only agree to do so if they provide me a list of users and amounts to fairly redistribute to the owners

[28-Oct-18 04:00 PM] SHossain#0007
that would be great @metaphilibert

[28-Oct-18 04:04 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I doubt they will disclose user infos but hey, nothing could surprise me from cryptopia lol

[28-Oct-18 09:37 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Just got an answer from cryptopia the wallet maintenance is over and withdrawals should be available again
I don''t have the possibility to test before tomorrow but here please try to remove your wlc from cryptopia.
It will be not be possible after the 11th of November, date of delisting

[28-Oct-18 09:57 PM] SHossain#0007
let me check

[28-Oct-18 10:00 PM] SHossain#0007
