[10-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Paro#7842
pubkey 1 450 + 240 = +690 total

[10-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Paro#7842
pubkey 2  : 630+510 = + 1140  total

[10-Jul-19 07:12 PM] dimxy#2587
please note that -marmara-test-pubkey param affects only activated coinbases (for even blocks). 
Coinbases for normal rewards (odd blocks) are sent to usual addresses (that is, to a node's -pubkey param)

[10-Jul-19 07:13 PM] dimxy#2587
So on PK1 and PK2 only activated amounts are relevant

[10-Jul-19 09:35 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
PK2 is for LCL (boosted) ones. Wasn't it?

[10-Jul-19 09:39 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think amplifying the ratio as suggested by @jl777c between the activated and boosted will give us if the Boosted coins produce more than activated ones. The ratio might be 30x.

[11-Jul-19 06:21 AM] Paro#7842
@dimxy 499 coin loop Over: 
PK1 ```
"myNormalAmount": 4290.99990000,
"myActivatedAmount": 3930.00010000,
```
PK2 ```
"myNormalAmount": 5989.99970000,
"myActivatedAmount": 5869.00000000,```

[11-Jul-19 06:23 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe PK2 receives rewards from locked-in-loop staking utxos on the second node, right?

[11-Jul-19 06:24 AM] Paro#7842
yes . PK2 499 coin locked.
pk1 normal and Locked 0

[11-Jul-19 06:25 AM] dimxy#2587
Did you already import the privkeys producing the equal segids for activated addresses?

[11-Jul-19 06:26 AM] Paro#7842
no. that's yesterday's test

[11-Jul-19 06:26 AM] Paro#7842
I waited for it to end.

[11-Jul-19 06:26 AM] Paro#7842
I'm testing "100,000" coins today.

[11-Jul-19 06:35 AM] dimxy#2587
okay

[11-Jul-19 06:35 AM] Paro#7842
100.000 coin test info.

[11-Jul-19 05:45 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Is PK2 locked as boosted?

[12-Jul-19 08:10 PM] dimxy#2587
I have done a new version, it supports the new rpc interface from the business requirements (with additional params like avalcount, EscrowOn,...) plus duplicate parameters were removed. Help switch would show the rpc's parameters
No approvaltxid yet (I believe this will be the next step)
This version is incompatible with the previous version due to opreturn structure changes

We came together for the tests after @dimxy has improved codes according to requirements specification document for Version 1.0. We are using the symbol MCL3. We will share the Komodod line parameters. You can join us.

[13-Jul-19 10:46 AM] Paro#7842
aval and escrow parameters working ?

[13-Jul-19 10:47 AM] Paro#7842
@dimxy

[13-Jul-19 10:51 AM] dimxy#2587
no, not yet
It is just new rpc compatible with the doc requirements, with no new functionality.
All those parameters are not used yet but accepted and stored in transactions.
Reserved for future true version 2

We setup the blockchain. Now we want to start with marmarareceive. The following gives error. 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL3 marmarareceive 036d41e9f88e76fab280f5b3adbef315c23b35e99dc72c3b8bb64c8db64b9b14cb 1000 MARMARA 60 avalcount:0 ```

The error is 
```

```

[13-Jul-19 12:32 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We tried also ```{"avalcount":0} ``` It gives same error.

[13-Jul-19 12:35 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
It worked as ```'{"avalcount":"0"}' ```

[13-Jul-19 12:43 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Could you give sample use with marmaraissue, marmarareceive and marmaratransfer for avalcount, autosettlement, autoinsurance, disputeexpires , Escrowon and BlockageAmount? @dimxy

[13-Jul-19 01:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We also want to make sure that credits locked in Loop should make 3x staking also in future Version 2. So it does not matter whether the person is issuing a credit according to Version  1 or Version 2, the coins locked in loop should have 3x staking power.

[13-Jul-19 01:25 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We made a credit loop. It seems settlement does not work. In Version 1 document, we had ```marmaraclaimautosettlements.``` I think it is not available at the moment. We checked The marmarasettlement, it is discontinued now. That part is ok now.

[13-Jul-19 01:31 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Is it made automatic within the code?

[13-Jul-19 01:57 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The settlemnt does not work. We will test with the previous version now.

[13-Jul-19 02:23 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think when the marmarasettlement is made "discontinued", the automatic settlement process is somehow left out.

[14-Jul-19 12:34 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We started a new test chain and I was involved personally in tests for the previous codes before non-functional addition of Version 2 parameters. They seem to be working nicely with settlement. But we could not make the tests for 3x staking of boosted, i.e. LCL against activated. The first blocks are not stable. Therefore, we left the blockchain to continue growing for first 10 hours.

[14-Jul-19 05:53 AM] dimxy#2587
marmarasettlement rpc does not work now. The settlement is done by miners calling internal settlement function.

[14-Jul-19 05:55 AM] dimxy#2587
Here is examples of rpcs in the latest version:
first marmarareceive call:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 marmarareceive 02d4567e8ed8d1eab2830df553cbddfe4cf17a8de73d080c716adff6ee820ce1f1 0.202 MARMARA 20 '{"avalcount":"1"}'

[14-Jul-19 06:05 AM] dimxy#2587
marmaraissue call:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 marmaraissue 03aadb18f5ddc369b15c67162b342d5db2d67e0ad0a87fac39bf8a174384e1d0ac '{"avalcount":"1", "BlockageAmount":"10000", "autoinsurance":"true", "autosettlement":"true", "EscrowOn":"true"}' e8ddc980a0ad1e05eea9c4a3c7336ede807101dd464b42b13037169845086722

[14-Jul-19 06:05 AM] dimxy#2587
subsequent marmarareceive call:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 marmarareceive 03aadb18f5ddc369b15c67162b342d5db2d67e0ad0a87fac39bf8a174384e1d0ac cd11de5a397f87d9c712cc76259f015b7317066b546e43428e28aec1638e973a '{"avalcount":"1"}'

[14-Jul-19 06:06 AM] dimxy#2587
marmaratransfer call:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 marmaratransfer 02bc47ce434b32a34115348938f4eecb7647109a1e16a144f32ebae9e4398c5c3e '{"avalcount":"1"}' 323c0002ff77237e1d0a1bdb13e3c7197a47840844ffa4adc2a7b0afb562a1b1

The point is the new parameters are added in JSON object (in apostrophes)
Also duplicated params amount, currency, mature are needed only in the first marmarareceive call

[14-Jul-19 06:09 AM] dimxy#2587
--------------
Please be aware that those new parameters (avalcount EscrowOn, BlockageAmount,... ) are not working yet
They are supposed to be implemented in V2
(I believe  we are still working on V1,  the params were added for the rpc compatibility with V2)

About checking staking multipliers:
As JL wrote we need probably several weeks to have chain staking to stabilize

[14-Jul-19 07:14 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Great. Thanks very much. What is the function to be called by miners for settlement?

[14-Jul-19 07:58 AM] dimxy#2587
This is MarmaraRunAutoSettlement function (it is not exposed as an rpc)

It is started automatically as the chain height reaches the check  mature height, by a miner

[15-Jul-19 05:32 AM] Paro#7842
@dimxy i have an idea. i dont know how to tell you.

[15-Jul-19 09:12 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I was with @Paro and @zekigulen yesterday. They are making black box tests. I also joined in some of the tests personally. Let me try to translate our concern @dimxy and @jl777c .  We made tests with the codes before the addition of blank parameters from Version 2. I think there is a fundamental problem as far as I  see from test results. We need to clarify it. When someone has coins in LCL, he/she should be staking 3x than normal activated. Now it seems to work like this. Suppose I have 40000 activated and no coin in LCL. It works with normal staking power. But supposse I have 10 coins only in LCL and I have 40000 in activated. And someone has  40000 coins in LCL but only 10 coins as activated. He can produce more even if the other person has more in LCL. I think it currently looks at the person if he/she has coins in LCL and prodcues from the activated ones not based on the LCL. LCL wallet address is only one address common to all and actually not stakeable.  Therefore, we don't encourage the real credit creators. People just need to lock something to get full 3x power of staking. If we summarize, we just need to lock something  in LCL to have 3x staking. The 3x staking is based on activated ones and not the coins  in LCL. This is what we see from the system. I think the problem may be solved by making  a stakeable address such as  "myLCLAmount" similar to "myActivatedAmount". Both  "myLCLAmount" and "myActivatedAmount" should stake simulatenously according to their contents.  I think "myAmountOnActivatedAddress-old" may be deleted. It is not needed any more. It was used to collect the latest 16 activated ones when we were having activated coins  between 3 months to 2 years. Now all coins are activated at a maximum height. I don't know if I could explain the concern well ?@Paro

[15-Jul-19 09:34 AM] dimxy#2587
If we are concerned with that low LCL amount produces small number of blocks (and big amount of activated coins will consume most of the blocks generation) we might disable staking on activated and enable only on LCL coins. But if the total LCL amount for that whole chain is low the staking might be unstable.
Alternatively we could change the  multiplier for LCL

[15-Jul-19 09:35 AM] dimxy#2587
myAmountOnActivatedAddress-old is temp value, for developer to check if opreturn is correct and now activated coins would  be lost. It will be deleted, please dont pay attention to it

[15-Jul-19 09:41 AM] dimxy#2587
I understand you can see that seems the activated coins produce more generated blocks than locked-in-loop.
But as JL wrote we need probably several week for staking to stabilize. So it is too early to make conclusion now that LCL coins is incorrect

[15-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
3x is likely too small a ratio to clearly detect in testing

[15-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
40000 compared to 10 is 4000x more coins, so you would need a 4000x ratio to compensate

[15-Jul-19 09:44 AM] dimxy#2587
I 'm running another test myself to provide that the chain staking is stable:
I setup 2 nodes wth equal segid activated addresses and use equal amount of activated coins on both of them. No LCL!
I'm waiting for the chain to produce the balanced number of blocks from activated coins. Now they are still unbalanced

[15-Jul-19 10:12 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Paro I think we need to look at the coding part to explain our concern. Black box tests are not enough.

[15-Jul-19 10:17 AM] dimxy#2587
the code is fully open. You might be concerned with LCL implementation. LCL is implemented as a shared account for the system to be able to spend it and redistribute amount between the endorsers (as the doc states). But each LCL utxo is marked with the pubkey who owns this part. So for staking only those utxo are picked up that are marked with the miner's pubkey. So this is a complete equivalent for myLCLaccount.

[15-Jul-19 10:26 AM] dimxy#2587
you could ask about any part of the code and I can clarify it.
Most of the code (rpc and helpers, opretun creation functions) is in cc/marmara.cpp.
Staking extensions are in komodo_bitcoind.h file
calling creation of miner's transactions is in miner.cpp file, 
this creation func, which calls MarmaraRunAutoSettlement, is in komodo_gateway.h

[15-Jul-19 10:38 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Do the staking extensions in komodo_bitcoind.h  also include LCL part?

[15-Jul-19 10:59 AM] dimxy#2587
the algorithm of adding staking utxo is in cc/marmara.cpp, MarmaraGetStakingUtxos which is called from the komodo_bitcoind.h

[15-Jul-19 11:00 AM] dimxy#2587
it enumerates both activated utxos then LCL utxos for the mypubkey (which is miner's pk)
Applying of the multipliers is in the cc/marmara.cpp MarmaraGetStakeMultiplier function, this function is called back from komodo_bitcoind.h, func komodo_txtime2

(komodo_bitcoind is a common src file, it itself contains little app logic and provides only callbacks which extend the basic komodo functionality for specific marmara features. The logic is in marmara.cpp)

[15-Jul-19 01:45 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Is there any way to Show people how much they can earn through activated staking and boosted staking? It does not need to be precise. Just estimation. Verus has such calculation on how much people can earn through staking.

[15-Jul-19 02:05 PM] dimxy#2587
We can do such estimations, yes. 
For the present test we cannot expect solid coin generation based on LCL amount until the chain stabilizes.
As I understand JL, it might take weeks to stabilize.
Plus, it is important what amount is locked, because if I have 10 LCL but another endorser has 4000 activated, I would have too low chances even with 3x amplifier

if 40% of coins is in each category, in a few days things will converge

[15-Jul-19 02:08 PM] dimxy#2587
I think for now we should reach the point when the test chain would give consistent predictable results.
I'm waiting on my test chain where I'm expecting that 2 equal activated amounts would produce equal amount of blocks

[15-Jul-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
with only 2 test points, it is possible that one of them gets lucky and if the staked block amount is significant compared to the total staking, it can permanently skew things. just the way the statistics works

[15-Jul-19 02:11 PM] dimxy#2587
yes I had similar suspicions.
Maybe it is better to have at least 3 staking nodes?

[15-Jul-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
or 4, 2 vs 2

[15-Jul-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but let current test finish and we can see how it converges

[20-Jul-19 02:44 PM] dimxy#2587
The staking test results (and also consultations with other devs) have shown that, seems, we cannot avoid splitting activated utxos into 64 addresses (matching to 64 segids).
So we need to implement this feature

Yes, no problem with merging back.

[20-Jul-19 03:07 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
What is the problem then?

[20-Jul-19 03:08 PM] dimxy#2587
We could implemented this like freezing some amount from a user's activated coins by splitting it on segids. So he would use it only for staking

[20-Jul-19 03:11 PM] dimxy#2587
But there are more problems with lock-in-loop amount - we cannot freeze it , it should be always available for returning back to users normal accounts as the BR states

[20-Jul-19 03:12 PM] Paro#7842
Plan: 300 coin loop
activated1: 100 MCL : 1xstaking
activated2: 100 MCL :  1xstaking
activated3: 100 MCL : 1xstaking

total 3x staking   ?

[20-Jul-19 03:13 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think that would be easier.

[20-Jul-19 03:14 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The 3 activating wallet

[20-Jul-19 03:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We just divide the LCL coins into 3 wallets equally.

[20-Jul-19 03:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
But of course more transactions

[20-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Paro#7842
Is that how it is. ? I did not fully understand.

[20-Jul-19 03:16 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Maybe we misunderstood

[20-Jul-19 03:16 PM] Paro#7842
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner Yeah. we may have misunderstood.

[20-Jul-19 03:18 PM] dimxy#2587
As I understand it to make staking work stable, we need to split the staking utxos inside the user wallet into 64 unique addresses.
(they will be generated by a special rpc which is to be made yet)

[20-Jul-19 03:19 PM] dimxy#2587
so after splitting a user would have 64 accounts in his wallet
Amount for staking should be split equally on these accounts

[20-Jul-19 03:20 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Not three. 64 addresses will be then.

[20-Jul-19 03:20 PM] Paro#7842
ow

[20-Jul-19 03:20 PM] dimxy#2587
So he needs to decide, what amount from his activated coins he wants to use for staking

[20-Jul-19 03:21 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Would it be easy/practical to implement?

[20-Jul-19 03:22 PM] dimxy#2587
Well, it's been done for usual coins, so it could be done for marmara activated coins too

[20-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Paro#7842
high "hashpower" may be required.

[20-Jul-19 03:27 PM] dimxy#2587
And I can see a problem with locked-in-loop amount. Seems we cannot 'lock' it once more on yet another 64 user accounts

[20-Jul-19 03:28 PM] dimxy#2587
Ideally locked-in-loop amount should be always split on 64 segid addresses
