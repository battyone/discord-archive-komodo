Create activated coins and split them on 64 segids for staking to work

Run marmaralock64 command with coins amount you want to reserve for stake. You do not need to have big amount even for production network as this is needed only for initial chain running while number of users is small and not all segids are covered by user addresses.

[09-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Paro#7842
ok i understand.

[09-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Paro#7842
"first node" & "second node" apply to these only.

[09-Aug-19 08:47 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe you have:
first and second nodes - generate coins
3 test nodes for issuer endorser and holder, do not generate coins.

So I think you could make the first node staking (setgenerate true 0) - and here marmaralock64 is needed
the second node mining (setgenerate true 1)

[09-Aug-19 08:48 AM] Paro#7842
yes. Now I have implemented the "first node" marmaralock64 command.

@Paro I have published a new version in the repo.
It has a few fixes: 
marmaracreditloop output corrected for settled loops
introduced a new open/close marker in issuetx (so it has 2 markers now: 1 marker to find all loops, 2 marker to indicate the loop is closed)
Important that this version changes the stake tx structure since block height = 2000 on MCL0 chain. We need to deploy this version before ht=2000 (or we need to change height=2000 in the code if the deployment is delayed)

Dear @dimxy and @Paro  I really appreciate developing and testing patiently. I hope everything is going smoothly. The 3x boosted staking for “Locked in Loop” took a lot of time to develop and test but I think it is worth since it is the key to success in MCL to promote credit loops for zero defaulting.

@Paro How is the test for 3x boosted staking going? @dimxy

[08-Sep-19 06:12 PM] dimxy#2587
I believe the boosted staking works but I think we did not verify it mathematically. It is not easy because of segids: to make the chain stable we split activated coins on 64 segids. So if we usually create only one loop for test its boosted coins would be staked rarely (as most of staking would be coming on the activated coins that are split on 64 segids). 
I think we might develop some not very complicated rpc which would enumerate PoS generated coins and output some statistics on them, like if this is activated or boosted staking, which address, total amount. Then we probably could see overall staking results.
Probably we would need to create loops for some specified time (to get enough statistic data) and allow to set a period for the getting statistic for the rpc.
I think it might need at least 1000 PoS blocks generated (with boosted utxo in the chain) to see the expected results as all 64 segid utxos will be used for staking and we will need to wait for many blocks to see that the single boosted utxo have been picked for staking at least several times.

@dimxy We need to wait 1000 blocks. is it correct ?

[12-Sep-19 09:37 AM] Paro#7842
Guess you need 5 PoS miner. (64segid reserved)

[12-Sep-19 09:38 AM] dimxy#2587
I suggested to collect enough statistics to see how boosted work we need to create a loop that would span around 1000 blocks or similar to ensure the boosted coins were picked at least several times for staking

[12-Sep-19 09:40 AM] Paro#7842
hmm .. now understand.

[12-Sep-19 09:41 AM] Paro#7842
ok .. test new version. new chain .. min "credit loop" time :1000

[15-Sep-19 07:09 PM] dimxy#2587
Hello,
I have created a new rpc ```marmaraposstat begin-height end-height``` that returns PoS statistics: stake addresses and how much coins were generated for each of them. It is also shown if an address is boosted and how many stake txns were generated for it.
-----
Also I found and fixed a bug with normal coinbase scriptpubkey generation.
------
So I suggest the following way to research boosted coins usage:
- update all nodes with the new version from my repo
- create a long credit loop (for 5000 blocks). The loop amount should be approximately equal to the amount of activated coins on each segid. Do not add any new endorsers to the loop, just wait.
- note the height where this loop was created
Now for boosted coins a stake multiplier of 100x is set in the code.
When enough blocks are passed we can run marmaraposstat  from the height where the loop was created till the chain tip and look into the stat.
If the algo works correct we would see in the marmaraposstat output that for the boosted address there are more stake tx and coins generated than for other non-boosted addresses

[15-Sep-19 07:51 PM] dimxy#2587
(I have started a similar loop on my test chain, so in 10-20 hours I can share the stat results)

[16-Sep-19 10:16 AM] Paro#7842
@dimxy I'll do the new chain setup. then I'll do the test "5000"

[16-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Paro#7842
"marmaraposstat begin-height end-height" where will we use this parameter?

[16-Sep-19 10:19 AM] dimxy#2587
yes this is better
I have added yet another change in the code:
I now temporarily send all the generated coinbase to normal address (not to activated for even blocks as the requirement doc states)
If not to do this mypubkey address (where generated coins go to) quickly becomes the champion in staking

[16-Sep-19 10:19 AM] dimxy#2587
I'm testing this right now

[16-Sep-19 10:19 AM] dimxy#2587

@Paro I updated code in my repo (https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/tree/marmara-v1-1-opret-v2), fixed some issues with staking for boosted coins.
I recommend starting a new chain to check boosted coins PoS generation.

for a new chain, to see how boosted coins generate blocks, make sure that all the segids have equal utxo values, for example make them with command 'marmaralock64 640 1', this will create 64 segids with one utxo in each of 10 coins.
Then make a loop also for 10 coins and for 5000 blocks till it matures.
Then you might periodically call `marmaraposstat 0 0` to see what address generated most of the blocks.
You may find the lock-in-loop address in marmaraposstat output with 'IsBoosted: true' tag.

(Note that I temporarily disable activated coinbases generation for even block for they do not contaminate PoS staking)

[17-Sep-19 11:29 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually for boosted coins PoS preference is done very simply: its value just multiplies by 100x (for test, actual will be 3x)
so 10 boosted coins will be accounted as 1000 coins in staking in this should be always the winner if all other segids utxos have only 10 coins

@dimxy What do you mean by “Locked in Loops coins are created only when a loop is created”? I thought current coins could only be locked into LCL and not created. Do you mean some of new block rewards come out as LCL coins and not activated coins?

[20-Sep-19 07:09 AM] dimxy#2587
No, I mean what it was supposed, that is, activated coins which are converted to locked-in-loop coins when a loop participant enters the loop

what does marmaracreditloop show for the issuance that you think you did not create (debb16...099)?
Also could you paste the output of ```getrawtransaction txid 1``` for this txid debb16...099?

[11-Oct-19 06:07 PM] dimxy#2587
when did you create this chain?

[11-Oct-19 06:10 PM] dimxy#2587
this issuance tx could be the old version tx (I changed once tx structure to provide that any miner could settle). Could you paste output of getrawtransaction with 2 params txid and 1, like
`komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL.. getrawtransaction debb1648321e95106f78d157a6ceefddd359d670eca453e439ca071ad271b099 1`

I fixed the problem with incorrect txid that showed in marmaracreditloop rpc (the update is in my repo). It should now correctly output issue txid in `marmaracreditloop debb1648321e95106f78d157a6ceefddd359d670eca453e439ca071ad271b099` call (now it outputs null txid for funcid='I')

yes this call, txid is null

[11-Oct-19 08:42 PM] dimxy#2587
after the update should be correct

[11-Oct-19 08:45 PM] Paro#7842
updating nodes.

[11-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Paro#7842

[11-Oct-19 08:54 PM] dimxy#2587
yes all nodes
