Aha, seems this is not implemented yet when issuer should get back 300.

[27-May-19 11:09 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Yes. When the second node transfers the baton to the third one, the issuer gets back 300 as normal.

[27-May-19 11:11 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
So no staking ability for 300. That power passes to second one and the 3rd node becomes new holder. Holder is always last node.

[27-May-19 11:14 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
For real economic case, you would not give credit to anyone unless you received goods or services since you transfer your coin to the next node at the end.

[27-May-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
correct, none of this millenium mode was implemented as the current version was created first, then after testing it the millenium mode was proposed

[27-May-19 11:31 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Actually, the Millennium mode was proposed after Version 2 requirements were developed. It was very quick decision. üôÇ

[27-May-19 11:32 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think It is very innovative. Young people proposed in our community.

Okay then let's implement this fund redistribution (I mean pk1: +600, pk2: +300, 300 back, pk3: +200, 300+100 back etc)
and validation that issuer / endorsers have sufficient locked amounts.

[27-May-19 11:34 AM] dimxy#2587
(what if endorser participates in several loops - we need to check total?)

[27-May-19 11:36 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We have 3 types of coins. Normal, activated and boosted.

[27-May-19 11:37 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In table, there are 3 steps. Marmarareceive, marmaraissue and marmarabatonapproval.

[27-May-19 11:39 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Suppose Marmarareceive is made by the endorser in second credit loop. We just need to check the activated to see there is enough. Then when baton is transferred with marmarabatonapproval, we can transfer it to boosted.

[27-May-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
always the totals must be checked

[27-May-19 11:40 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think no need to check the boosted. If there is enough in activated we just transfer that to boosted.

[27-May-19 11:40 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
When batonapproval is made

[27-May-19 11:41 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
But in the mean time, if one of credit loops is opened/settled/processed, there may not be enough activated.

[27-May-19 11:43 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
But this is perhaps rare. The blockchain fund in third layer may be utilized anyway.

[27-May-19 11:44 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
That may be used as safe heaven.

[27-May-19 12:07 PM] dimxy#2587
From the point of view of a possible credit issuer:
Suppose I decided to participate in this, collected some free money and locked them. Now I probably want to do nothing and wait for staking premiums.
But in our schema as long as a new endorser enters the loop I just receive my money back and have to reinvest it again.
Maybe the system should not return the money to me but find a new request?

[27-May-19 02:24 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Then people may not find enough normal coin to transfer since activated/boosted ones cannot be transferred. The half of blocks comes out as activated/locked. Credit Loops will also require boosted coins. Since 75% of block rewards are generated through staking which requires locking, there will be scarcity with normal coins.

[27-May-19 03:56 PM] dimxy#2587
When someone receives the baton he becomes a holder.
Then when the holder passes the baton to the next one, he becomes an endorser and should lock some money to share the debt.
Could he instead just pass over the baton and remove the debt from himself (that is, could he just pay with this cheque to the third person for this person's goods)?

[27-May-19 04:33 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Do you mean he/she will only pay for half price of goods or services? Then the next endorser will pay for one third of goods and services. I could not get exactly.

[27-May-19 04:35 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The idea here is to get the ability of full power of staking when involved as another endorser.

[27-May-19 05:04 PM] dimxy#2587
From the table in the BR I understand the following:
In a loop there are an issuer and several endorsers and the last is the holder.
The issuer and endorsers share the debt and are responsible for paying it off. But the holder is not responsible for paying off.
So he holds the value. How could he use this value to pay for goods and services? 
I thought he could simply pass the baton to another person (who provides goods) and do not become an endorser

[27-May-19 05:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
It happens as exchange of credit with goods/services. When I issue a credit to first endorser, he/she transfers goods/services. The holder always provides goods/services but has no coin. Coins belong to earlier nodes. Therefore, all are responsible to pay debt to holder at the end. I transfer digital baton you transfer goods to me.

[27-May-19 05:58 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes I got it that holder receives baton for his goods.
When he received it he actually received a right to claim coins in future (seems I wrote inaccurately that he holds value).

[27-May-19 06:02 PM] dimxy#2587
so when he passes the baton further he always becomes an endorser and would pay the part of the debt to the next holder

[27-May-19 06:44 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Yes. And each endorser somehow gets goods/services but the holder has no goods/services at the end. Actually in the the first millenium addition, the fully-collateralized coins are used as normal money but they give them power of staking when boosted/locked in credit loops.

[27-May-19 06:44 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Yes. And each endorser as well as issuer somehow get goods/services but the holder gets no goods/services at the end. Actually in the the first millenium addition, the fully-collateralized coins are used as normal money but they give them power of staking when boosted/locked in credit loops.

[27-May-19 06:46 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In Version 2, no money is needed until the end date of credit loop. So it has to be settled at the end with some mechanisms including community layer.

[27-May-19 06:47 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The Version 2 is based on completely money creation.

[27-May-19 06:48 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Of course, in Version 2, first the issuer is responsible. to pay debt to holder.

[27-May-19 06:50 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
If issuer's activated fund is not enough, then the nodes in credit loop is visited in a top-to-bottom approach to settle the whole debt.

[27-May-19 06:51 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
If still not settled, the funds in  community layer are used. Supporters in community layer are called avalists.

[27-May-19 06:51 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The third layer, the blockchain fund  is last resort of redemption.

[27-May-19 06:53 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
But in that case, where the third layer is used to settle, all nodes except the holder are blacklisted. Avalists who are supporting may also be blacklisted depending on their percentage for support.

[27-May-19 06:55 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In summary, the Version 1 works on trustless nature of blockchain whereas the Version 2 is a trust based system.

[27-May-19 06:58 PM] dimxy#2587
yes I got this that in v1 participants have to fully back credit themselves mostly
and in v2 it will be special third parties who specialize on backing

[27-May-19 07:19 PM] dimxy#2587
Actually I'm a bit confused with the table in the BR, about how the value is transferred:
on steps 1,2,3  pk1  locks 600 coins and receives goods for 600 coins form pk2
on steps 4,5,6 pk2 locks 300 coins and pk1 receives normal 300 coins from his locked amount.
So now pk1 has 300 normal coins and 300 coins locked and he has goods for 600 coins 
At the end of the table pk1 has already 450 normal coins and he has only 150 coins locked and then settled to the debt (and he still has goods for 600 coins?).
So my impression is that pk1 received goods for 600 coins and payed only 150 coins.
Where am I wrong?

[28-May-19 12:04 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The earlier ones have more time to use the full staking power with more coins. The risk is reduced with each endorser added. If suppose there are 101 nodes in a credit loop, the node 100 pays only 1/100 of 600 to receive goods for 600 coins. But of course, he has very limited power for boosting since he locks very limited amount.

[28-May-19 12:06 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The node 100 just pays for 6 MCL to receive goods worthing 600 MCL. But he can only do full staking with 6 MCL.

[28-May-19 12:08 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
At 101, each except the holder will have 6 MCL boosted. And it is very easy to pay for the holder at the expiry/settlement date of credit loop.

[28-May-19 12:11 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
But as @jl777c said, the performance may be degraded in larger Credit Loops since 100 wallet needs to transfer 6 MCL to the holder during settlement.

[28-May-19 02:13 PM] dimxy#2587
Hello @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner ,
Thank you once more for the explanations.
I also found this your note in the dev-chat transcript:
```At the due-date, all other nodes are responsible to the holder/last node starting from the credit creator first until the node before holder. If credit creator/issuer pays for holder, the credit is destroyed. If not paid, the non-redemption process starts. Either automatic or manual. In automatic, it is easier. The 5% blockage by credit issuer (if there is one) is transferred to holder/last node, then all timelocked coins belonging to credit issuer is used to pay for holder. If there is sufficient amount that is ok. The case is settled. Otherwise, all nodes in credit loop are visited one by one in sequence, and their timelocked coins are used to pay for holder. ```
From this I assume we need 2 rpcs:
1) marmara_settlement which tries to settle the baton with only issuer's funds: blockage + all timelocking funds are used to pay for holder
2) marmara_nonredemption which is executed if the first rpc was unsuccessful or partially successful. It visits all nodes and writes off their timelocked funds in equal fractions to pay to holder the remainder

[28-May-19 03:40 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
That note is from the past discussions. The most mature document is Version 2. All needed functions are in that document.

[28-May-19 03:42 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
There is blockageamount parameter in Version 2. But we don‚Äôt need in Version 1.

[28-May-19 03:43 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We don‚Äôt need nonredemption function in Version 1, either.

[28-May-19 03:44 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Because we can do marmarasettlement at any time due to 100% collateralization.

[28-May-19 03:45 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Btw, marmarasettlement is an internal function now and that is called by miners.

[28-May-19 03:46 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The existing code of Marmara CC has marmarasettlement  as a function to be called externally

[28-May-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be simpler implementation wise to have autosettlement in 2 transactions

[28-May-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
or just 1 if the issuer has enough funds

[28-May-19 04:41 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In Version 1, we have the credit divided by (N-1). Do you mean we can settle them in 2 transactions? Suppose we have  11 nodes and the credit is 600 MCL. Then each node before holder will have 60 MCL in boosted. Do we make all transfers from 10 accounts at 2 transactions?

[28-May-19 04:42 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Or do you mean the autosettlement in Version 2?

[28-May-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
even in version 1, unless there is a default, the issuer should make full payment, right?

[28-May-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i think making that the first settlement tx and then another to deal with the case where the first one wasnt enough

[28-May-19 05:06 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In millennium the risk/share is reduced with the new node. I think you meant the existing code. So it is not only the issuer. It is only valid when we have 2 nodes. But when we have new nodes, the amount is shared equally with the formula Credit/(N-1). So issuer has only his/her equal share. There is no defaulting in Version 1.

[28-May-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
then i misunderstood millenium version

[28-May-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
why would people in the credit loop want to pay 1/N?

[28-May-19 05:09 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
They will make boosted staking.

[28-May-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but not enough to compensate for 1/N

[28-May-19 05:09 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
It is not only issuer who can make boosted staking

[28-May-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the issuer needs to pay, unless he is defaulting. then the 1/N from all are auto-collected

[28-May-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
for any large amount, there is no way extra staking will earn enough coins for largeamount/N

[28-May-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so the 1/N amounts provide the 0% default rate, but it should only be used for whatever unpaid balance

[28-May-19 05:33 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
If we want to take from the others, too, they need to be able to do boosted staking.

[28-May-19 05:33 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
If we do it the way you say, it will be also usable in Version 2.

[28-May-19 05:34 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Since we will be trying to clear starting from top to bottom in Version 2.

[28-May-19 05:36 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Would it be problem if we take equally in Version 1? Is it problem with performance?

[28-May-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
we can do it, but it doesnt make any sense. why would anybody signup to pay for somebody elses debt?

[28-May-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
in 100% of the cases

[28-May-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see many creditloops being made if that is the case, the first one to sign up takes the risk of 1/2 the total and for what? a bit of extra staking??

[28-May-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
wont work is the problem

[28-May-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to take from the issuer as much as he has in 1/n and normal locked funds

[28-May-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
then the rest equally from the rest of the credit loop

[28-May-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
now, it does matter to the creditloop participants the reliability of the issuer

[28-May-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but still there is 0% default

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Then we can take 100% from issuer and he/she has the power of boosting. No need then for credit/(N-1) from others

[28-May-19 05:56 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
No need to collect from others

[28-May-19 05:59 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
But wait. The same person may be using the crediting in Version 2 in future. Then when we have fiats the defaulting might happen when we have boosted coins used to support Version 2.

[28-May-19 06:01 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think we can use credit/(N-1) but when we make redemption we can go from top to bottom to clear.

[28-May-19 06:05 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
For redemption, yours seems to be more reasonable. We try first the issuer to clear all. Then first endorser and others. But why do we need then credit/(N-1)? Also the requirement document needs to be changed ƒ±f we make it that way. We also need to discuss in our community

[28-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
we need the 1/N-1 to guarantee 0% default rate

[28-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
usually it will be much less than 1/N-1 needed, only on total default. if the issuer had any funds at all (more than 1/N-1) the amount needed from the rest (equally) will be less than 1/N-1

[28-May-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so just 2 steps, from issuer and if needed equally from the rest

[28-May-19 06:12 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
So we just need to change redemption scheme then. Why not we make the clearence from top to bottom? That will be compatible with Version 2.

[28-May-19 06:14 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We try to take from issuer first if not cleared we continue with all nodes in sequence until we redeem all?

[28-May-19 06:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The earlier ones will have more boosting power

[28-May-19 06:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The later ones will not have enough time to boost.

[28-May-19 06:16 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The same algorithm may be used in Version 2 then

[28-May-19 06:18 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
It will be the redemption scheme that we aggreed at the beginning. Responsibility decreases with the nodes increased

[28-May-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, that would work too

[28-May-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i like that it is the same as for v2

[28-May-19 06:34 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Perfect. The table is not changed but the redemption will be from top to bottom. @dimxy

[28-May-19 06:38 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@jl777c The thing is the later nodes will have boosted coins and they will not be released. If we leave the boosted coins untouched they might be used to support Version 2 trust based version. Or even in Version 1, that might promote the later nodes to issue credits in future.

[28-May-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, plz work out the details to make sure, but this seems like it will work well

[28-May-19 06:43 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I will modify the document for the redemption process. It will not be equal. Will be from top to bottom. Just few sentences.

[28-May-19 07:19 PM] dimxy#2587
looking forward for the updated document

[28-May-19 11:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@dimxy @jl777c I sent the modified document.

[29-May-19 10:12 AM] dimxy#2587
I can say that in the current implementation it does not differentiate if coins just locked or locked in credit loop. 
I'd say coins are simply locked on randomized height in 3 month...2 year interval. No correlation with issued amount.
And during the settlement it just draws coins from the lock 1of2 address.
So we need a special account for coins locked in a loop?
