yes

I tried my marmara code on a staked chain. It needs to be further corrected for marmara activated 1of2 address.
So for now it would work only on PoW non-staked chains...

[11-Jun-19 03:23 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
If you could give the komodod line that you used, our team members can test with existing parameters. @Paro @zekigulen

[11-Jun-19 04:16 PM] dimxy#2587
I used a chain with very basic parameters:
first node:
./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY1 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=2 -bind=<ip> -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc) -pubkey=<pubkey>
second and thirs nodes:
./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY1 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=<ip> -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -pubkey=<pubkey>

[11-Jun-19 07:13 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
What is the block reward?

[11-Jun-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if not specified 0.0001

[12-Jun-19 09:31 AM] Paro#7842

We need three IP addresses. @Paro

[12-Jun-19 12:17 PM] dimxy#2587
I suggest creating three nodes:
1st with -bind=ip-first param
2nd and 3rd with -addnode=ip-first
(please note staking is not supported yet, I'm working on this)

[12-Jun-19 12:54 PM] dimxy#2587
A question about staking @jl777c :
Do normal coins participate in staking or only activated (and now locked-in-loop) coins? It seems to me in komodo_staking normal coins are excluded from staking.

[12-Jun-19 12:56 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Normal coins should not stake.

[12-Jun-19 12:56 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
You are right.

I was able to run a staking chain for marmara cc.
But getlastsegidstakes rpc shows that not many blocks are staked.
It also shows that all the staked blocks are generated for the same single segid.
And indeed, I could not do sendmany64 to distribute utxos for all segids, I believe it does not support activated coins.
So should we implement a similar solution for utxo distribution for the activated coins (and even locked-i-loop)?

[13-Jun-19 01:17 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Could it be due to lack of other nodes? @jl777c was mentioning the instability of block-come-out when there are not enough miners in case of lower mining percentage than 20-25%.

[13-Jun-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
for a high percentage PoS chain, it is CRITICAL that in the early blocks to distributed the funds across all 64 segids

[13-Jun-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
distribution is very important

[13-Jun-19 01:30 PM] dimxy#2587
So seems, we need to implement a generator of 1of2 activated addresses for 64 segids.

[13-Jun-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
could be

[13-Jun-19 02:14 PM] dimxy#2587
Is this important only for early blocks (seems to stabilize the chain)?
Maybe we do not need this for lock-in-loop addresses. They are actually a 1of2 addresses consisting of marmara globalpk and createtxid pk, that is, no any part to make variations for segids

[13-Jun-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
just early blocks

Are you trying credit loops now on the chain? There must be at least 3 nodes/accounts for test.  @Paro @zekigulen

[14-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Paro#7842
Are there extra commands?

[14-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Paro#7842
If the old commands are valid, we start the tests.

[14-Jun-19 07:05 PM] dimxy#2587
No new commands yet,
but for marmarainfo and marmaracreditloop added additional info (about locked-in-loop funds)
marmaralock now has only the amount parameter

[14-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Paro#7842
oh ok

[15-Jun-19 12:39 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
1. Which functions are ready from marmarareceive, marmaraissue, marmaratransfer, marmarabatonapproval, marmaraclaimautosettlements and marmarasettlement? Among these the marmarasettlement should be internal to be invoked by marmaraclaimautosettlements not to be called directly.
2. Are these functions changed according to Version 1? 
If ready we can start tests

[15-Jun-19 08:22 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Paro @dimxy  can we start chain with similar parameters defined in document? We defined 30 MCL per block. Now it is only 0,0001.

[15-Jun-19 08:22 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The name can be MCL0.

[15-Jun-19 08:22 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The premined is 2 million.

[15-Jun-19 08:24 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We also need to define pubkeys for founders. 12 may be a good number. And one additional for the blockchain fund.

[15-Jun-19 10:39 AM] dimxy#2587
I suggest starting a new chain as I implement distribution of activated coins on segids, this chain could have the needed reward and founders parameters

[15-Jun-19 10:56 AM] dimxy#2587
Now the following functions are implemented:
marmaralock, marmarareceive, marmaraissue, marmaratransfer, marmarasettlement.
marmarasettlement is not yet called by miners (it should be by the holder for now)
marmarabatonaproval is not made yet (I believe it was suggested to ignore it for v1.0)

[15-Jun-19 11:03 AM] dimxy#2587
So, it seems autosettlement is what is missed to conform to the v1.0 specification. So let's make it.
There is a question about this: if a miner does autosettlement he probably should receive some reward for this job, isnt't it?

(maybe I presented my code a bit too early, but I had idea to begin testing the lock-in-loop account as its algorithm is not so simple)

[15-Jun-19 11:11 AM] dimxy#2587
And it is needed to add v2.0 parameters as default values yet

[19-Jun-19 01:53 PM] dimxy#2587
Update: 
I have implemented marmaraautosettlement (called by a miner)
the next is adding marmara v2 extended parameters to rpcs as default values, reserved for v2

It works as MARMARAXY1.
but does not work as MCL0.

[19-Jun-19 03:58 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@dimxy Thanks very much

[19-Jun-19 03:59 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Paro You need to download and setup blockchain as MCL0 with parameters that I suggested

[20-Jun-19 12:43 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@jl777c Is something wrong with following

[20-Jun-19 12:43 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
```./komodod -ac_name=MCL0 -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -bind=37.148.210.158 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -gen -genproclimit=2```

[20-Jun-19 12:46 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
They try to start  the chain with that parameters. They claim that the name MCL0 is not accepted.

[20-Jun-19 12:48 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
They say that it works when they write:-
```./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY1 -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -bind=37.148.210.158 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -gen -genproclimit=2 ```

[20-Jun-19 01:05 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Paro Revise the parameters similar to the previous one with staking as 75, premined as 2 million and reward as 30 per block.

[20-Jun-19 01:09 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
When you use already a name it might give problem to use the same name later. You need to delete related directories from all nodes.

[20-Jun-19 01:19 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Dear Marmara Chain community members. 
You can start testing Marmara Credit Loops for Version 1.0. The new MarmaraCC may be followed from https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/commits/marmara-v1-1

@Paro I revised the parameters similar to the MTST3 test chain with new parameters. 
```./komodod -ac_name=MCL1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_cc=27410 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_reward=3000000000 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -reindex & ```

[20-Jun-19 01:27 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think the parameter -ac_cc=27410 should be changed .

[20-Jun-19 01:46 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@dimxy What is your parameters line? The testers need to use the same test chain. They try to establish a new test chain themselves but they cannot do with the name MCL0 or MCL1.

[20-Jun-19 07:51 AM] dimxy#2587
my chain params are:
staked node
./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=2 -bind=172.31.5.51 -whitelist=172.31.0.0/16 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -port=14722 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=<pubkey1> -printtoconsole -gen -genproclimit=0 -debug=marmara-1 &

[20-Jun-19 07:52 AM] dimxy#2587
I'll try chains with the names MCL0 or MCL1 (BTW I cant see any exceptions for these names in the code)

[20-Jun-19 01:49 PM] dimxy#2587
Do we need all parameters such amount, currency, matures etc to be repeated in each credit loop transaction opreturn?
Could we simply save most of them in the first creation transaction and just retrieve them from it (so we may exclude these parameters from the subsequent transfer/receive calls)?

[20-Jun-19 02:35 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
This is actually what I wrote in the new requirement documents for both Version 1 and Version 2. The current code repeats many parameters in marmarareceive, marmaratransfer etc unnecessarily.

[20-Jun-19 03:17 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@dimxy You can propose any function parameter to be truncated in consequent functions/operations if that is to be repeated unnecessarily.

[20-Jun-19 03:20 PM] dimxy#2587
yes, I'd like to do this. 
I need yet to work out which param is needed on what loop stage.

[20-Jun-19 06:28 PM] dimxy#2587
I think you need the following steps (on a fresh chain):
1) run 2 nodes without -gen -genproclimit parameters
2) on both nodes run getnewaddress and then validateaddress to get pubkeys
3) restart both nodes with -pubkey parameters and still without  -gen -geproclimit
4) on the first node run `setgenerate true 1`
5) wait for 3-4 blocks mined
6) on the first node run `marmarainfo 0 0 0 0` and ensure that there are activated coins
7) restart both nodes with params:
staked node (first) with `-gen -geproclimit=0`
second  node `-gen -genproclimit=$(nproc)`

Dear @dimxy There is confusion among our team members. They are trying to establish different test chains. We, all must be speaking the same language. I think it is better you suggest one test chain with the parameters.  You can call it MARMARA3. But Let it be 30 MARMARA3 per block per minute with 2 million premined. You can send @Paro  or @akaplan  enough  so that they will distribute those among our team members to make activated staking and credit loop testing.

@Paro  seems there is a problem in the `bind` and `addnode` params you listed:
-bind of the first node should be set to the local address of the first node
-addnode on the second node should be set to the ipaddress of the first node
in your example both params are equal

What's the problem in - it is not generating blocks?
When you start both nodes do they see each other?
what does `getpeerinfo` show?

[21-Jun-19 09:59 AM] Paro#7842
they don't see each other. 
"getpeerinfo" is empty

[21-Jun-19 10:14 AM] dimxy#2587
well we need to make them see each other.
the 27346 tcp port should be accessible on the server

[21-Jun-19 10:16 AM] Paro#7842
I've run it right now.

if no blocks on the chain yet then synced=-1 is normal

[21-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Paro#7842
"blocks": 101,
  "longestchain": 0,

[21-Jun-19 10:38 AM] dimxy#2587
were both nodes started from empty chain?

[21-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Paro#7842
yes . new chain

[21-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Paro#7842
delete all ./komodo/*

[21-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Paro#7842
