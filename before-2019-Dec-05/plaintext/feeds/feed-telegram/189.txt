[telegram] <Edward_CM> Yep, but any new wallet version released yet? (re @PTYX11: On the 15th if I'm not mistaken)

[08-Dec-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Not yet I don't think

[08-Dec-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Edward_CM> K thanks. The update guide doesn't really give much information. Just says update the daemon and Sapling activates the 15th. (re @PTYX11: Not yet I don't think)

[08-Dec-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Are you using a native wallet?

[08-Dec-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Or a light wallet

[08-Dec-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Edward_CM> Usually just Lite. That's what I don't understand though. I can choose to use native anytime, so I'd think the version is important. (re @PTYX11: Are you using a native wallet?)

[08-Dec-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Edward_CM> Are these people using native and leaving it loaded 24/7?

[08-Dec-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> For light mode you shouldbt have to worry about it much

[08-Dec-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> It applies to servers mostly (re @Edward_CM: Are these people using native and leaving it loaded 24/7?)

[08-Dec-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> And miners

[08-Dec-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Edward_CM> K, what's the worst case scenario if an update isn't made using native on time? Lost coin?

[08-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Fork, reindex, or a resync

[08-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> If you have your wallet.dat and are on native you can recover the funds.

[08-Dec-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Edward_CM> Ok cool. So just to clarify, a wallet update version is supposed to be released anytime now and we need to update before the 15th? Or will the version ship on or after the 15th?

[08-Dec-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Edward_CM> Didn't see that clarified anywhere really.

[08-Dec-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
release is being built now

[08-Dec-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Edward_CM> Cool, as long as there's a little time to update and not like a 12 hour notice or something. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> release is being built now)

[08-Dec-18 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810

[telegram] <Zong_1> excuse me *if this was posted in an update, but was wondering, is integrating the ZEC Sapling update a priority for the team at all? (re @PTYX11: So we can recharge for 2019)

[08-Dec-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zong_1> I would guess probably not, mainly due to the mountain of other things that take precedence, but if anything can be gleaned, id be appreciative to know

[08-Dec-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Actually the December 15th update is for the sapling implementation

[08-Dec-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Dec-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Young> What news? (re @PTYX11: It's big news, it's the sapling update coming to Komodo.)

[09-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I think I keep repeating. The Sapling update is coming. There are a few improvements coming with that update (re @Young: What news?)

[09-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Improvements
Performance for shielded addresses
    Payments involving the new Sapling z-addresses can be constructed in as little as a few seconds and with only 40 megabytes of memory.
Decoupled spend authority
    Allows the hardware that constructs the zero-knowledge proof to be independent from the hardware that signs for the transaction.
Improved keys
    Full viewing keys allow owners of shielded addresses the ability to view incoming and outgoing transaction details without exposing their private spending key.

[09-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> What is Sapling?
Sapling is a network upgrade that introduces significant efficiency improvements for shielded transactions that will pave the way for broad mobile, exchange and vendor adoption of shielded addresses.

[telegram] <Young> Komodo, KMD is one of the most undervalued coins on the market right now. Ultimately KMD's selling point is that it allows people & companies to create and develop their own blockchain solutions to fit their needs. People can create their own blockchains on the Komodo platform easily and with freedom, they are not limited by Komodos parent chain and can customise the features to their needs. KMD's platform also provides a secure and simple platform to develop off. 
I am Bullish on KMD because as blockchain continues to become more well known and more widely accepted, we will no doubt see a correlation with an increase of the price of KMD. Komodo is also continuously expanding its operations to support icos and more.
We can expect a steady increase of price in KMD as time continues.
