Decentralized poker is quite a difficult problem for various technical reasons, but especially the requirement for all players to be able‚Ä¶

[telegram] <TheoHx> tron has poker through tronbet (re @Acura360: https://medium.com/@jameslee777/chips-lightningnetwork-pangea-cc-blockchain-enforced-realtime-poker-and-other-games-1b67fa1d96ed)

[14-May-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and its fully decentralized?

[14-May-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> if there was a site like tronbet for KMD, with slots..id be plating right now

[14-May-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
a centralized poker is trivial

[14-May-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> no idea, im not as smart as you

[14-May-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
decentralized is quite a bit harder

[14-May-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
considering that tron network itself isnt decentralized, i cant imagine they bothered to decentralize apps

[14-May-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> are slots possible?

[14-May-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i read of apps that disappear with funds, which wouldnt be possible if it was decentralized

slots would be possible

[14-May-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
roullete

[14-May-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
any card game

[14-May-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
anything that needs random numbers in a deck form

[14-May-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
wheel of fortune

[14-May-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and multiple players

[14-May-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> why would the payment system have to be realtime? for instance you could just have a buy in that is static throughout the game of poker with a vote for people to buy in. realtime payments as a side chain within each game? i could be talking out of my ass...but is that a potential workaround?

[14-May-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are playing a poker game, it is your turn to bet. you want to bet or check in non-realtime?

[14-May-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> chips would be converted back into KMD after the game, the original KMD kept in a form of escrow

[14-May-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
people will wait for 1 to 3 minutes for each player action?

[14-May-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
from what I see of online poker, the entire hand is played in 20 seconds or so

[14-May-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
did you read my post?

[14-May-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> i was reading it, yes

[14-May-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
this CHIPS being converted back into KMD is exactly what i write about

[14-May-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i explain how your "form of escrow" would actually be implemented

[14-May-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> ahhh, missed that part sorry

[14-May-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> so ultimately...even having a micro blockchain for each game that is 1-1 for KMD after the game would still take too much time to be feasible

[14-May-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> chips created then burned after the game

[14-May-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
in online poker if you take a minute to make your play, you are forfeit

[14-May-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
average block time of one minute...

[14-May-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
problem it is

[14-May-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i describe a solution to fully decentralized trustless realtime poker. it seems you want to take out the realtime part for some reason

[14-May-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> i have no idea if you can connect decentralized to centralized. not a blockchain developer fyi

[14-May-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> not a developer at all

[14-May-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
this pseudo decentralization is likely what many projects do. decentralize one part and then claim it is fully decentralized

[14-May-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible, but doesnt reduce the centralization at all, so what is the point?\

[14-May-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> at least i wasnt far off for not being a developer ;)

[14-May-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> if each game, literally each game of poker is independently centralized, then wouldn't the ecosystem be decentralized?

[14-May-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> guess thats a philosophical debate

[14-May-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if the dealer in a game can run away with all the money in the table, how does that make it decentralized

[14-May-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
any centralized part in the system makes the entire system contaminated with the centralization

[14-May-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
weakest link

[14-May-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not philosophy, it is just realizing that any central point of failure makes it much much less reliable than being trustless

[14-May-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> how could they run away if they have to go back though to same channel to get their conversion back into KMD, chips stuck in the game untill the end, split pot gets confirmations. KMD being the only door

[14-May-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
