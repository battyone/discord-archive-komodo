[telegram] <miguelborges99> I've now 471 confirmations... the same value is shown in my wallet, in the transaction history: https://www.kmdexplorer.io/tx/0db110e5913c8875775fd86e04cbee722b3157e5f5475367fb8e28bfaef4e818 (re @Regnar: Yea in my experience Binance to Agama is quick. Wallet to wallet is borderline instant. Bittrex to wallet was a little while, and I've never sent KMD to an exchange because I dont sell it :D)

[22-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> Well, I'm not completely sure if I can now transfer my kmd's into another wallet, since the number of confirmations is always increasing. I'll wait til confirmation phase ends...my Unconfirmed Balance is zero, so everything seems to be fine in my wallet.

[telegram] <miguelborges99> Yes, I've sent some kmds from Bittrex to my wallet and they are already stored in the wallet, I can see them in the balance. However, the number of confirmations keeps increasing (now at 519). Is this normal ? (re @Regnar: Maybe I'm not understanding you. You sent from Bittrex to your Agama wallet? Does it show a balance in Agama?)

[22-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes it is. (re @miguelborges99: Yes, I've sent some kmds from Bittrex to my wallet and they are already stored in the wallet, I can see them in the balance. However, the number of confirmations keeps increasing (now at 519). Is this normal ?)

[22-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> The confirmations will always be increasing

[22-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Sometimes when you send TO an exchange though they wont give you access to funds until a certain amount of confirmations are made. But your wallet will show transactions before they are confirmed and you are good as soon as you get a single (I believe just 1) confirmation

[22-Sep-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> humm...ok. I wasn't expecting that. So, kmd seems very fast.  Time to read you resources. Thanks.

[22-Sep-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Haha yes 1 minute blocktimes and transactions will appear almost immediately (showing 0 confirmation) just saying it's coming in and needs to be mined before you can spend it. (re @miguelborges99: humm...ok. I wasn't expecting that. So, kmd seems very fast.  Time to read you resources. Thanks.)

[22-Sep-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But yes, the more confirmations the safer. But a single one will do in wallets

[22-Sep-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> Right, the first confirmation was quite instant. If you were a merchant, then how many confirmations would you wait/recommend?

[22-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> 1 haha

[22-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Depending on the transaction size tbh (re @miguelborges99: Right, the first confirmation was quite instant. If you were a merchant, then how many confirmations would you wait/recommend?)

[22-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If I were an exchange or someone receiving large sums, I'd want at least 10. Komodo notarizations to BTC happen every 10 minutes, so while it's likely that the transaction would be notarized sooner than 10 minutes, 10 confirmations (roughly 10 minutes) would ensure it. As soon as the hash of the transaction is notarized, they can't 51% attack the chain. So if you accept large amounts of money, I'd say 10 confirmations. Smaller amounts I'd say 1, as it would cost way more to try and 51% attack, and fail anyway, just to get your $20 back

[telegram] <changemymindk> How are you 40? You act like you‚Äôre 10. No offense. (re @AsadKhan1953: Their they make monies ???)

[22-Sep-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OriginalBitcoin> What I mean is when you buy KMD, you can‚Äôt move those coins from Cred into your KMD wallet.   The only way to get money in and out is to sell your coins and then making a withdrawal for USD.  Kinda pointless for those of us in crypto.   I‚Äôm familiar with the standard ACH process but the wait times have been excessive for both buying and now selling. (re @Regnar: I cant speak for CRED, I'm not a rep for them or anything but from what I see their payment processor is Plaid which is pretty standard in banking and fintech apps. So Plaid authenticates account data which makes ACH transfers easier/faster but pulls from your account (not plaid or CRED) are still processed by ACH. Which does take days (kinda why we're all in crypto) so no surprise on the wait time there, companies like Coinbase have insane amounts of USD and Crypto which they basically front you the amount for the days while the backend transactions are actually happening. CRED probably doesn't have that money yet.
I'm not sure what you mean move Komodo to KMD wallet, but I dont have the app. I dont know what they do with sell requests though. But 12 days seems like a lot.)

[telegram] <Regnar> What you're describing is a type of custodial app like Abra and they aren't uncommon, but idk if that's what Cred does. You should ask them. If that's the case it likely isn't what you want but there's definitely a market for those types of wallets. People who want exposure investing in coins, but not using them. I mean, there's tons of custodial services popping up right now, including some major banks.

[telegram] <Hermes08> Other than technical specs and way orders function , Hyperdex has a custom code that makes transactions easier to perform. It still uses market maker as Barterdex but it has some custom code added to make it way easier for users.

[22-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> There‚Äôs BarterDex the core technology that facilitates atomic swaps and provides peer to peer order matching. Then there are two GUI front-ends, Hyperdex and BarterDex. It‚Äôs unfortunate the name ‚ÄúBarterDex‚Äù for the core tech shares the same name as the GUI ‚ÄúBarterDex‚Äù but it is what it is. (re @pumba2988: What's the difference between barterDEX and hyperDEX)

[22-Sep-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> BarterDex GUI is a reference client that‚Äôs a bit more technical in nature and a intimidating for most users. Then there‚Äôs Hyperdex which provides a clean minimalistic design with much less clutter making it easier to setup trades for the average crypto user.
