[telegram] <Regnar> Make sure if you are on iOS you do not shut the app down or lock the screen. Apple will kill the data access to the app and mess with the order. 
Android you can lock the screen but don't close out the app

[telegram] <t_dan> My app was open all the time. Circa 30 orders that are still stuck in step 0. (re @Regnar: Make sure if you are on iOS you do not shut the app down or lock the screen. Apple will kill the data access to the app and mess with the order. 
Android you can lock the screen but don't close out the app)

[31-Oct-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Also if you're picking an order from the orderbook to fill, it will match. Give it a sec, this isn't like a centralized service where your app sends a POST request to an API, you are actually connecting to peers using a libtorrent.
