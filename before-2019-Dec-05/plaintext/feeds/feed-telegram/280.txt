Good! With this update, Komodo gives assetchains the opportunity to  change the name of the client. No "Satoshi". No "MagicBean". This is a  personalization of the projects in the spirit of Komodo. @0xca333 @KomodoPlatform What do you think about this? #komodo #KMD #jl777 ...

komodo is just part of that 99.9% of alts that will never get any traction, and just keeps getting squeezed as more alts come out to fight for the dwindling pool of speculators. look at the thousands of alts that exist today. over 50% came out since 2017, and it's not going to slow down.
the fact is they could have ethereum-killing tech today and it wouldn't matter, because ethereum has already won, and a constant stream of "better tech" alts isn't going to change that. timing is everything, an komodo has like hundreds of other alts completely missed the boat.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> 1). Saying tech means nothing in crypto makes no sense.  2). The growth of businesses and developers using komodo contradicts the not gaining traction.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Your argument is essentially  ‚Äú everything has been done already why do anything ‚Äú

[telegram] <yorklab> We'll be seeing the results of the rebranding process throughout the year and RedFoxLabs, which just finished it's IEO, will be building companies based on the Komodo platform. Come back later in the year and we'll see if Komodo has gotten any traction or not. (re @sagacity25: what do you think about this point Regnar : the people talking about "tech" are the late adopters that haven't been around long enough to realize that tech means absolutely nothing in crypto.
komodo is just part of that 99.9% of alts that will never get any traction, and just keeps getting squeezed as more alts come out to fight for the dwindling pool of speculators. look at the thousands of alts that exist today. over 50% came out since 2017, and it's not going to slow down.
the fact is they could have ethereum-killing tech today and it wouldn't matter, because ethereum has already won, and a constant stream of "better tech" alts isn't going to change that. timing is everything, an komodo has like hundreds of other alts completely missed the boat.)

Dont get me wrong, ETH did an amazing thing when it was able to get consensus on all contract states. The problem that led to GAS was that‚Ä¶

[telegram] <barbierir> this point implies that blockchain tech has no other use case than speculation, that existing network effects and money trump everything else. So it's better to extract as much gainz as possible and exit before it all crashes down in due time. The other theory is that it has real use cases and that it all seems equal, for now, only because no project has scaled to mass use (yet). Ethereum has a lot of momentum but even the best case for Eth 2.0 is orders of magnitude worse than Komodo for real world use. Eventually if people want to build real stuff they'll need to use what actually works. They won't spend 10x time, money and effort when they can do the same for 1x. The reactions seen by people when they discover Komodo tells it all. When all pieces are in place, it will shine.
