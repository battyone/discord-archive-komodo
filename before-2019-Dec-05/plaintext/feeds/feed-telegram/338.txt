[telegram] <ionstar> I'm still wondering though (not sure if i'm the only one experiencing this) is why the Verus version of agama does not want to close. It's always stuck on "App is closing. Please wait", where the original agama would close just fine.

[06-Jun-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> As a precautionary measure in case of other possible issues that may be unbeknownst to us (re @ionstar: Interesting read. However, it means I probably didnt have to go through all kinds of hoops to move everything, since I was using native mode for 2 years and have never entered my seed in agama (as agama created my wallet basically).)

[06-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> I also realised something I didnt realise before, which is that the seed seems to only be referencing one address/wif. Agama (?) seems to prefer using new addresses for everything, every time you claim interest, etc. Which means that the original seed (the one you backed up) holds nothing anymore at some point. So basically you need to always make sure you request the wif of the new address if balances are sent to a new address. If I understand this correctly.

[06-Jun-19 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Always get the wif of the address if you can to import in case your wallet gets corrupted

[06-Jun-19 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptodiddler> When did the KMD project first launch?

[06-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> That's what I get from this indeed. I always had the impression (from howto's/faq's, etc) that backing up the seed is important. However, if you use Agama, you have a wallet.dat which in itself holds (in my case) 30+ addresses. Just importing the seed only gives you the original address which has had zero balance for a very long time. (re @polycryptoblog: Always get the wif of the address if you can to import in case your wallet gets corrupted)

[06-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> Maybe this needs to be emphasized somewhere on the website (if it isnt already listed somewhere), because just having your seed is not equal to having a backup if you use agama and ths may have acquired multiple addresses over time.

[06-Jun-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> Is there a "bulk" checker available somewhere? Where you can enter a list of addresses and get KMD (and other asset) totals from?

[06-Jun-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Majority of users use lite mode,  for wallet.dat yes back up every address individually to be safe (re @ionstar: Maybe this needs to be emphasized somewhere on the website (if it isnt already listed somewhere), because just having your seed is not equal to having a backup if you use agama and ths may have acquired multiple addresses over time.)

[06-Jun-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
Yesterday, the npm, Inc. security team, in collaboration with Komodo, helped protect over $13 million USD in cryptocurrency assets as we found and responded to a malware threat targeting the users of a cryptocurrency wallet called Agama.

This attack focused on getting a malicious package into the build chain for Agama and stealing the wallet seeds and other login passphrases used within the application.

The details
The attack was carried out by using a pattern that is becoming more and more popular; publishing a “useful” package (electron-native-notify) to npm, waiting until it was in use by the target, and then updating it to include a malicious payload.

The GitHub user sawlysawly published this commit on Mar 8th which added electron-native-notify ^1.1.5 as a dependency to the EasyDEX-GUI application (which is used as part of the Agama wallet).

The next version of electron-native-notify was published 15 days later and was the first version to include a malicious payload. Following that Agama version v0.3.5 was released on Apr 13.
