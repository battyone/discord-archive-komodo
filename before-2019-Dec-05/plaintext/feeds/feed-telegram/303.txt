don't use `space` or special chararacters or symbol for the wallet file name

[22-May-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <AireeZahari> But i didnt put any space..just alpahabet and number ie password123 but still error..is there any min or max characters?

[22-May-19 07:19 PM] SHossain#0007
that is the wallet file name
try `test_1` or `test-1`
don't try `test 1` or `test &` or `test%&`
or use `test1`
