[telegram] <Lennart> Would be nice to claim and auto send to another address

[19-Sep-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Or even auto claim, auto jumblr, auto send to another address 😜

[19-Sep-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> One step at a time 😊

[19-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MAC07> What does other projects using dPoW do for Komodo? Get the name out? Saw the Hush announcement on discord.

[19-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> They pay ~300 kmd per year i think

[19-Sep-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MAC07> Interesting.

[19-Sep-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Yes the dPoW has a cost of 300KMD and 300 of the currency

[19-Sep-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> That's per year

[19-Sep-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Nicee! It might be a quick algorithm to write up but it would be cool if it auto claims based on the most profitable claiming frequency based on your balance (account for # of hours downtime after claiming, and txfee) (re @PTYX11: I am going to add a feature to Chameleon that allows for automatic claiming. You will be able to configure it.)

[19-Sep-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I wanted to just add autoclaim in the settings with a frequency option of weekly, biweekly, or monthly.

[19-Sep-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Once the user has 10KMD the autoclaim setting will become available

[19-Sep-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kakashi> So if KMD hypothetically went to $100 would it be $30,000 per year for dPoW or will the amount of KMD cost be adjusted? (re @PTYX11: Yes the dPoW has a cost of 300KMD and 300 of the currency)

[19-Sep-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> The cost will remain the same if the frequency of notarizations doesn't change

[19-Sep-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> As the frequency of notarizations is lowered or increased, so does the annual cost.

[telegram] <Tobe> Only a handful of alt coins are doing well at the moment, and by that I mean today. And only in comparison to yesterday. Not sure why you would want to spread that kind of uninformed negativity, but it's really not needed here. This is for supporters of the project. (re @AsadKhan1953: Poor performance by KMD every other coin is booming)

[19-Sep-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Tobe> I'm actually looking at the markets currently, only about 25% of coins are in the green for 24hr%..and they're all way way down over last 90 to 120 days...kmd is actually in the top 30% for retained value during the bear market. Sooo..as I mentioned, uninformed opinion that's negative = f ud, no?

[19-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <AsadKhan1953> It depends when you bought (re @Tobe: I'm actually looking at the markets currently, only about 25% of coins are in the green for 24hr%..and they're all way way down over last 90 to 120 days...kmd is actually in the top 30% for retained value during the bear market. Sooo..as I mentioned, uninformed opinion that's negative = f ud, no?)

[20-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Tobe> It depends more on when you sell, unless you had planned to sell it today, the price of the coin today matters not. I mean, if you're swing or day trading or whatever...but I'm talking about long term appreciation..these guys are all in their infancy still, but as much as you can, put it in your hardware wallet and forget about it for a few years, and by all means, do not sweat the short term pricing.
