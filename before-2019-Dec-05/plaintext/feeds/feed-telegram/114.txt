[telegram] <Lennart> Hey guys i have some questions regarding Komodo:
- how much is the notarization costs affected by bitcoin network fees? How are these costs covered, i read somewhere they are covered by money raised in the ICO? What will happen in the next bullrun, when btc fees skyrocket again?
- will the +/- 300 KMD for notarization services for assetchains stay like that in the future? So right now it is relatively cheap to run a chain with KMD dPoW, but when KMD is at 50$ a coin, it will be more expensive?
Thank you

[24-Aug-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> 1) Even with high tx fees there is enough for a decade or more.  And if LN works how btc core wants it to a lot of the congestion causing tx will move offchain.  2) tiered notarization  will eventually be enabled by 3rd parties to have a fiat priced notarizations (re @Lennart: Hey guys i have some questions regarding Komodo:

[telegram] <Lennart> When to expect? (re @polycryptoblog: New coins end block 7777777)

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Approximately 13 years

[24-Aug-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Thx. So btc fees are paid from ico-money

[24-Aug-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Yes,  that was the purpose of the ICO to fund notarization costs

[24-Aug-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> If some clever guy could visualize the notarization process in a short video for non-tech people.. that would be fantastic. I'm struggling trying to imagine how a snapshot of all kmd + assetchains adresses can fit into one single btc transaction üòú

[24-Aug-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Thank you. Didn't know that, wasn't around back then.. üòî (re @polycryptoblog: Yes,  that was the purpose of the ICO to fund notarization costs)

[24-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> The notarization process is rather simple.  3rd party chain has notaries that record the last valid blockhash by incorporating it as metadata in a transaction on the KMD network. KMD does the same with its blockhash and writes it to BTC network .  This notarization can be referenced to see if anyone has tampered with the network.  You can condense an infinite amount of data into a finite string through hash functions.  If the hashes don't match up something has been altered.

[24-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> it will notariza to another blockchain, whichever is most secure

[24-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jamlite> There are other blockchains?

[24-Aug-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jamlite> So there are dapp platforms like Ethereum, but Komodo is different because it lets you build your own blockchain?

[24-Aug-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> yes, the blockchain  is independent from Komodo

[24-Aug-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Aug-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> you asked what happens if bitcoin hashrate declines, if it's still the largest hashrate notarization will continue on Btc, if another has more hashrate then notarization will switch to another

[24-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> as many as you want, for notarization service there's an hardware limit because notary nodes must run all chains to be notarized, but later there will be 2nd tier notarization services and so no longer limit (re @Jamlite: How many chains have been built so far using Komodo?)

[24-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
