[telegram] <Suzy> To be honest, and this is mean, but all I see are dead projects without use. Sure, all crypto is like that, but the kind ecosystem is very ded. (re @Regnar: Here's the start of a simple source of a lot of awesome Komodo stuff. Check my most recent contribution of proof of concept apps. Source was created and run by Grewalsatinder
http://awesomekmd.com/)

[07-Nov-19 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Not sure where you are seeing that, or are looking? (re @Suzy: To be honest, and this is mean, but all I see are dead projects without use. Sure, all crypto is like that, but the kind ecosystem is very ded.)

[07-Nov-19 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I usually respond back with a big explanation touching on all the insane advances Komodo has created for its tool kit, that any projects can use. But that always seems to be wasted effort for me. Komodo is building tools, projects are using those tools, the more cutting edge stuff we're building proof of concepts for because it is more abstract and we will need proof of concepts and case studies to show what it can be used for (like every other technology out there)

[07-Nov-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> The ecosystem isn't dead, I literally just showed how I'm trying to collect the mass of ecosystem projects and independently developed tools and apps. 
So please just read some of the posts Komodo puts out on the website, they do it multiple times a week with ecosystem updates, tech Tuesdays,  AMAs etc. 
Not to be mean, you have only said two things in here (we literally have a search function to check) the first you said jl777 left Komodo, which was completely wrong and out of the blue. And the 2nd was that the komodo ecosystem is dead. üôÑ

[telegram] <Deadpool1001> You just entered at the wrong time to the market. Bear markets are brutal in crypto. Specially for alts. Only advice i can give is that dollar cost average buys, hodl good projects with active devs and community that also brings new innovations and dont invest more than you are willing to lose. (re @Suzy: No problem, I understand. I just have been holding for year and have ptsd.)

[07-Nov-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Exactly. Also see which projects don't slow down when there is a lack of money going around and low prices. Komodo doesn't have a massive ICO fund, or dev fund like Zcash, and the fact that development has only accelerated is a great way to show this ecosystem is strong! 
Just look at countless other projects where devs stop when the coin value is down. Or liquidate their holdings and laying off devs and team members. On the contrary, Komodo is HIRING!

[07-Nov-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea, it's easy to keep "decentralized projects" going if you have a ton of centralized money paying people. But it's much harder, and is a greater indicator of a community's strength when you grow without that, or when money is coming from a bunch of different people voluntarily.

[telegram] <t_dan> Atomic Dex has no volume yet, so it might be hard to buy KMD from BTC in quantities there or get a good price. When it comes out of the beta stage and is more widely adapted, it will be an awesome exchange. But till then you should buy KMD from BTC still at Binance or Bittrex.
