[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> what is the best wallet to send my KMD too , I was going to use MONARCH so i can gain interest up to 10% and interest on all crypto while collecting my staking but I was shutdown from interest because I am in iusa ,

[16-Jun-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> Try Magnum Wallet. You can claim interest in Magnum. (re @CRYPTOCHAOS: what is the best wallet to send my KMD too , I was going to use MONARCH so i can gain interest up to 10% and interest on all crypto while collecting my staking but I was shutdown from interest because I am in iusa ,)

[telegram] <kingsking612> KMD is the real bitcoin (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> hacker seemed to only care about KMD)

[16-Jun-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> After the Agama disaster, I just installed the Qt based Komodo wallet. How can I claim my reward there?

[16-Jun-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I'm so mad on Komodo, motherfuckers...

[16-Jun-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> were any of your assets stolen?

[16-Jun-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> actually did somebody lost anything?

[16-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> I did not, at least no Komdo, not sure about the other assets on in my wallet :(

[16-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I do not know if they test the wallets released or not. What testing do they have? The hack is so fucking basic. What I lost is negligeble but even that makes me mad, because it was my account and my kmd were moved. What I lost more was the trust...

[16-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Did you read how it happened? (re @miguelborges99: I do not know if they test the wallets released or not. What testing do they have? The hack is so fucking basic. What I lost is negligeble but even that makes me mad, because it was my account and my kmd were moved. What I lost more was the trust...)

[16-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> The change was introduced upstream. There should have been a lock on the dependency so it couldn't be updated remotely. This could have happened to anyone. The key thing here is that this sort of event makes or breaks a project. At the end of the day, consumers didn't lose funds. Komodo took the hit and returned funds to everyone that claimed. Komodo didn't break which also shows the teams actions were swift and true.

[16-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> If anything, this should bolster your trust in the team and their resolve to securing your funds.

[16-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You're mad because noone lost funds and a huge accident was averted? (re @miguelborges99: I'm so mad on Komodo, motherfuckers...)

[16-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <siulynot> Im sure the team learned from this one. (re @miguelborges99: I do not know if they test the wallets released or not. What testing do they have? The hack is so fucking basic. What I lost is negligeble but even that makes me mad, because it was my account and my kmd were moved. What I lost more was the trust...)

[16-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> People have lost funds, even if they are negligeble.

[16-Jun-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
0.82 KMD, is this what you are still complaining about?

[16-Jun-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I also learn a lot

[16-Jun-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I am mad for trusting in komodo SW, and I'm disappointed for everything.

[16-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Was it a single address, or a group of addresses? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> less than 750k so far)

[16-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> you mad at binance and all the other hacks , this was averted , i do have to ask tho , if they stopped the  hack could they stop my movement of coins

[16-Jun-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
a group of about a dozen addresses

[16-Jun-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kremer (n k)> A group, but most was digitalprice (re @Regnar: Was it a single address, or a group of addresses?)

[16-Jun-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> I have quite a lot KMD that is still there but I am not sure about my other assets like BTC that was bound to the same address

[16-Jun-19 05:11 PM] gcharang#6833
>  if they stopped the  hack could they stop my movement of coins
CRYPTOCHAOS
the team was able to stop the hacker by getting the seeds from the hacker's server. Not by doing any blockchain magic

[16-Jun-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> so somebody knows how I can claim my reward with the new Qt based wallet?

[16-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> btw the around ~23786 NPM dependencies that an avarage JavaScript project and pulls GB-wise non-checked JavaScript code into your JS build... apps that are build this way, are not necessarily suitable for high confidentiality apps

[16-Jun-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> a common practice in many JS projects like Agama is to tell the dependency management system to pull "the latest version" of an dependency which is also just in same in terms of build & quality reliability

[16-Jun-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> not sure if it was the case in Agama though

[16-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> Who was affected by the heist? I am surprised that I still have my balance which is quite high...

[16-Jun-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> Everybody who has used Agama should necessarily be affected?

[16-Jun-19 05:21 PM] gcharang#6833
loxal
to claim rewards, send the whole balance to the same address it is sitting on currently

[16-Jun-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> ah, thanks! @Matterbridge_kmdbot

[16-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> what is the recommended fee? I do not want my tx to get stuck

[16-Jun-19 05:24 PM] gcharang#6833
the default will go through
0.0001 KMD
there is no fee market in KMD, yet

[16-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> does it matter if I use z-send or regular send to claim my reward? I would prefer z-send as this tx is not publicly visible?

[16-Jun-19 05:34 PM] gcharang#6833
there are no z-addresses on the KMD blockchain now
we have deprecated that feature
I am not sure what the z-send in the qt-wallet does now
you can use send

[16-Jun-19 05:35 PM] gcharang#6833
Z transactions may be available for KMD in the future in the form of a parallel chain

[16-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> I had/have quite a high balance incl. 1 BTC and other assets that I store via Komodo. I wonder that nothing was stolen from me although I have used Agama on my Android phone. May it be that the thief still has the key and will withdraw the assets later?

[16-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> It's amazing, the KMD team secured the users' deposits in an emergency situation before the hacker could do it, and then there are users who get upset that they didn't get back 0.8KMD from their secured deposits. What would have been better, the hacker has your KMD and you have nothing, or you get your KMD back and don't complain about the missing ridiculous 0.8KMD ( $1). Such a ridiculous thing (re @miguelborges99: I will not forget that. I've less in my wallet now. Put the money where it was...

[telegram] <loxal> guys, Komodo is - like many other blockchain platforms - a new technology with many risks and those risks are inherent to all blockchain platforms. *This risk is the price for being decentralized.* Mistakes happen and I am sure the Komodo team learned out of this mistake.

[16-Jun-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> I support Komodo running a node and investing into Komodo. I do not do it for the money but to support technologies that promote decentralization. The speculation aspect is not my primary motivation.
