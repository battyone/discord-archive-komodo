[telegram] <Acura360> Komodo‚Äôs Third Annual Notary Node Elections Will Begin Soon
Since the very beginning of Komodo, the Notary Node Elections have been a central piece in the project‚Äôs governance model. Every year, KMD holders elect the individuals that will take on the responsibility of running one of Komodo‚Äôs 64 Notary Nodes for the ecosystem. Read More.
April 1: Candidates are highly encouraged to submit their proposals by this date.
April 7 (estimated): The 7 top-performing Notary Node Operators from each of the four regions will be automatically re-elected. Performance is measured according to the number of notarizations each node participates in.
April 14: VOTE coin airdropped to all KMD holders. Voting starts immediately after the airdrop is complete.
May 14: Voting deadline. Winners are announced.
June: New notary nodes are activated through a scheduled Komodo blockchain update.

[telegram] <hotkiss666> KMD should be the superstar in the next bull market cycle, but now it should be more in brand promotion, we should clarify a propaganda proposition: "Let everyone be free to create their own blockchain" and create some cases To promote.

[telegram] <hotkiss666> Using KMD's chain to help funds flow freely around the world is something that everyone wants to do. A true decentralized exchange should be an asset trading platform, not just coins. I think that KMD already has such technology to help assets flow freely around the world, and the trading conditions set in the chain can completely solve some of the traditional world's property rights and tax troubles.

[30-Mar-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Mar-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Simply put, native involves you downloading the entire blockchain and being your own node. Lite mode uses SPV so you don't have to download the chain. Your private keys are safe and local with both (re @Sikander16180: Is there a link where I can read about the differences between native mode and light mode?)

[telegram] <Regnar> Veruscoin yes, you can also use Verus wallet which is built on Agama, I think it has in wallet mining capability too for VRSC. Pirate is native mode only as ARRR uses only z transactions which there isn't support for lite mode yet (from any group including Zcash) (re @I3hAR6Av: Can i store verus coin, pirates in agama lite mode? I already have kmd in agama lite mode..)

[telegram] <Regnar> Being a hardware wallet ledger definitely has its advantages over a desktop wallet, mainly storing keys offline and on the hardware itself. Agama in native mode will store your keys on your computer, lite mode doesn't need to save keys, you would use your seed phrase to access your wallet, but you can also save the seed phrase and encrypt it so you can access lite mode with a password as well. (re @CryptomanXX: I know but is it safe as ledger ?)

[telegram] <Regnar> But those are still on your computer, reality is you use your computer for other things that may increase risk. Like browsing the internet, playing games, downloading things etc. A hardware wallet has one purpose, to store funds, so I'd say they are safer for the average user.
