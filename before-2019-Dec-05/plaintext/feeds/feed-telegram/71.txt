[telegram] <ca888_v1> Hello all. Been reading about the block 1M changes to "easy mode" mining for notary nodes. I quote "We have deployed a new method that calibrates the non-notary mining to 25%"

[telegram] <ca888_v1> üëçüèª Thanks. So, if it's a constant advantage, for a notary node with x sol/s and a non-notary miner with also x sol/s, over a long enough timescale will the miner mine 25 blocks compared to notary node's 75? Is that what "calibrated to 25%" means? (re @polycryptoblog: Same advantage just done differently.)
