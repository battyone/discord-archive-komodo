[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo is Delayed proof of work. The d stands for delayed (not to be confused with delegated proof of work or delegated proof of stake) (re @AnthonyRichard: Kmd is dpow and dpos?)

[25-Feb-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Basically its proof of work with a system of notarizations to an external network, Bitcoin. Komodo takes a hash of its entire ecosystem and stores it on Bitcoin, now when new blocks are generated the chain of hashes must also match the previous notarized hash. So if a 51% attack is occurring and attempts to change a block hash (reversing a transaction in the block) the rest of the chain will reject this chain regardless of it being longer, because it does not match the most recent notarized hash.
