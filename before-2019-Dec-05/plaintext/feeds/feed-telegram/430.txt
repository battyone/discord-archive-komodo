[telegram] <Regnar> In case anyone was reading the awards and wondering about the last part for me, what I am working on. I'm collecting (and sometimes building my own) demos, GUIs, and proof of concepts of Komodo CCs and compiling a list. The goal is to organize them in a way for people to get a better idea of the kinds of things that can be done with CCs.

[telegram] <tese22> I thought about something like that when pokemon go was in the first months after release

[06-Nov-19 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tese22> Where can I find that info?

[06-Nov-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tese22> Will check your work! Thank you for your efforts

[telegram] <Regnar> There's definitely a push to get more GUIs made, at least a proof of concept one so people can see them

[06-Nov-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> TUIs as well (Text User Interface) which is much simpler but very effective and sometimes keeps a cool retro feel

[telegram] <Regnar> Most of that was Satinder, he set up the site and had most of the information, I added the CC PoCs. But thanks! If you noticed TonyL is absolutely crushing it and has made a ton of GUIs and TUIs! (re @Buralux: Awesome work Ragnar, Thanks to your work I discover more on the Komodo sphere)
