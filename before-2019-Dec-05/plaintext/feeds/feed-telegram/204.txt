[07-Feb-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think there is a market for it, KYC, AML, Anti-terror will have its place, it's likely a different market than who DEXs target but I would encourage you to look into Cryptoconditions to power your platform. Depending on how you do your orderbooks there may be a way to incorporate atomic swaps and potentially the new market maker 2.0. Even though it seems you will be up and running before MM2, it would be a huge benefit to you to offer liquidity on market maker on the backend too. This would help you fulfill more transactions without being limited to the direct traffic to your exchange. I don't imagine this being a problem with your KYC procedures since you are getting your liquidity from other exchanges and cannot rely on them to perform KYC/AML on the coins that come to you.

[telegram] <chmex> No just KMD (re @Cdude: Does https://blocktivity.info measure all the blockchains in our ecosystem?)

[07-Feb-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> But all Ecosystem would be an interessting metric

[07-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cdude> Yes it would, does it not measure the whole eco for Eos or ETH?

[07-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> Yes it does

[07-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cdude> Well kinda unfair if you ask me

[07-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> But in their defence it all sits on one big chain.
In our eco system these are independent chains

[07-Feb-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> But I see your point

[07-Feb-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cdude> But still

[07-Feb-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cdude> Thats the point of KMD

[07-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> I will try to get some numbers in the next few days

[07-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> Maybe we can add something to blocktivity

[07-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cdude> Would be cool to see How it would affect the rabkings

[07-Feb-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> Or do our own if we already have the data üòä

[07-Feb-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cdude> Its impressive that KMD is in the top 10 excluded all other chains. Yes We should

[07-Feb-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> It will just surpasse Wave and on a very active KMDice day KIN

[07-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You still get all the notaziarions unto the main chain, so while blocktivity might not reflect the activity in each independent sidechain, it does show the notarizations.

[07-Feb-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> Correct which is the majority of transactions.
