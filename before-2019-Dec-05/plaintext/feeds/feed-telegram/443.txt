[telegram] <Regnar> Agreed if you can't liquidate it's hard to justify the run, however before these new exchanges were listing KMD, Binance had already disabled wallets, and Binance is sitting on probably the largest supply of KMD (some estimates of 10 Million KMD).
If there is that much KMD sitting on the exchange with the highest price, they could easily sell KMD for BTC, send the BTC to another exchange with lower price and Buy KMD there. A single arbitrage to pull 10% gains and get more KMD.
The reverse (selling on Binance from other wallets) doesn't work, but we could and should see one way arbitrage that shows more selling pressure in Binance and buying pressure elsewhere. (re @EPIDEMIC_media: You cant sell anywhere thats showing the best price unless you have KMD on exchange. Thats why this run is a mirage. A true run allows you to liquidate on demand)

[18-Nov-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> And if these exchanges that still have deposits enabled, and have lower amount of KMD available, we should see arbitrage equalize the price quickly.
It's also possible people aren't doing this because they LIKE trading the isolated prices, we shouldn't always assume the market is rational üòÖ

I swear I read a fair amount, and even watched the crypto rich interview with the michael. 
but i could never figure out the relevant differences between pbaas and baas. I think there's even a project called mitx that does bpaas.

[18-Nov-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> There are several big thing about PBaaS:
1) no entity skimming fees: al proceeds goes to the people securing the network. No entity other than those is gaining from it (for the people, by the people)
2) (multiple) currency reserves: makes it possible to exchange your coins from the PBaaS chain to VRSC without a 3rd party buying your coins. The system is built into the blockchain itself. A 2nd reserve can in future be made to another PBaaS chain or even to a fiat on-ramp
3) Chains can be finite. If we have voting in the future, a chain can run for a pre-set period. (re @Craig: If anyone is bullish on verus I'd love to hear why.

[telegram] <greatoooo> Gentlemen, I have bought KMD as Bitcoin, üòâ

[18-Nov-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> If there was such a crazy demand the arbitage would have been ate up and prices would be balanced across all exchanges. If anything its luring people to buy at the cheaper price hoping the market will true up. Instead it goes back down just like we saw in the last 8 hours. You guys can try to frame it in a postive way all you want, but the simple matter of fact is that the market is rigged. (re @Regnar: And if these exchanges that still have deposits enabled, and have lower amount of KMD available, we should see arbitrage equalize the price quickly.

[18-Nov-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> What are you talking about framing it in a positive way? I just said there should be arbitrage driving the price down on Binance and up on other exchanges (equalizing below current price by selling the coins that are still on Binance, there's close to 10M, and rebuying on cheaper exchange.) That would be a guaranteed profit in BTC with the same amount of KMD holdings, or ending with more KMD. But it isn't happening right now.
People are FULLY acknowledging the price discrepancy due to Binance disabling deposits, but aren't narrow minded enough to think that is the sole reason for price increasing. (re @EPIDEMIC_media: If there was such a crazy demand the arbitage would have been ate up and prices would be balanced across all exchanges.

[18-Nov-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> "The simple matter of fact that the market is rigged" 
Implying what? That someone deliberately disabled Binance wallets to pump the price on a single exchange? 
Maybe you should think of the simpler fact that prices almost always pump in markets that are isolated from arbitrage. It always sounds like you are promoting some conspiracy.

[18-Nov-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Thats an unsubstantiated claim, "almost always" üòÇ.  Can you prove that another coin has jumped 100% while the exchange wallets were disabled? If so what happened when things were enabled back?

[18-Nov-19 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> I didnt say you did. But since you claimed that they "almost always" pump when wallets are disabled I figured you may have the data to back it up.

[18-Nov-19 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There are tons of reasons for price movements. From news, TA, whales, growing awareness, growing demand, etc all of which are exasperated by limiting arbitrage opportunities (disabled wallets)

[telegram] <Craig> Was the stress test a failure? Not if the devs got good data.
HOWEVER
As a casual investor and potential user I found it sobering.
I had seen people posting on Twitter and YouTube about how awesome atomDEX is. 
The crypto community is sleeping on the fact that the holy Grail of crypto aka a LEGIT dex is already here! 
Just a matter of time until people notice!
I was hyped! 
Then I tried it out. Almost unusable. I'm not talking about how it was overwhelmed by 160(!?) testers.  Problem is, there are absolutely no features at the moment, not even a public orderbook. Things I didn't even think were features, like charts, just aren't there yet.
To be clear, I dont blame the team because my favorite idiot Twitter personalities over promise. 
But here is how I felt after the test: 
"This needs probably 6 months to be ready for prime time, and probably a few months after that to start catching on. Meanwhile you have like 50 competitors trying to lauch their DEX in the same time frame. Not to mention the possibility that people just stick with central exchanges.
"KMD has been bleeding for 18, 20 months, maybe longer. I don't expect that to change before they deliver cool, speculator friendly stuff. I mean, look at what's happening in the ETH ecosystem, all their defi stuff. Derivatives, lending, oracle's, tons of stuff. In 9 months KMD will have a sweet DEX (we hope) but some of these other ecosystems might have X Y and Z by then, on top of various decentralized exchanges."
Anyway I decided to hold my KMD after the stress test, but count me skeptical on november's 500 to 1300 pump.
