[07-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> The purpose is to pay for services rendered by ChainZilla such as apps, icos, blockchains, and any other service we provide to our clients. Also, the plan is to use the chain as a second layer of notarization on Komodo. We will use the Zilla coin to distribute votes and also for keyvalue storage when we store documents on IPFS.

[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> How does airdrops work on the agama wallet

[07-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> You just have to hold the Komodo in a wallet that you control and if you have above 500 KMD you will reci√©ve some zilla (re @DingDongSoLong: How does airdrops work on the agama wallet)

[07-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> It depends on the airdrop. Some projects as for a registration. We actually are doing a 2 phase airdrop. The first one won't require a registration, it just requires that you hold a certain amount of KMD in your wallet

[07-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Will agama just open an New wallet for you

[07-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> Yes,make sure u written down your phrase and back up wallet.dat file also u can make your own phrase (re @DingDongSoLong: Will agama just open an New wallet for you)

[07-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <KLMJ1> Checkout Chainzilla looks really good for the future of KMD. Mini airdrops fun as well.

[07-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jul-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Yes. And 50% of the supply will be locked for 365 days as a fund. Each year we will vote on expansion plans and take from the fund. Then re-lock the remaining amount for another year

[07-Jul-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
