[telegram] <LinhDo1842> hi, does anyone know if komodo has any competition/ support program for developers to build dapp on your platform? or any program to build up your community.

[telegram] <Keytothegate> I don't understand what are you guys crying about?? You put zero commitment to actual project, zero interest in actual development and what is being built and only cries about the price. So retarded, weak, negative, lazy, egoist thinking that it's not funny anymore. It's a free market - you can sell and you can buy whatever you want. If you are not happy with something just sell and be gone. Don't cry, it's pathetic. I don't know what is remotely as retarded as crying to unknown persons about things that are not in your control while you are doing nothing.

[telegram] <t_dan> It‚Äôs so poor to complain about price or try to blame someone or something for it. People who don‚Äôt know the difference between price and value should not invest at all. If you do your due diligence and figure that the value of a project like komodo is very high, you should be really happy about low prices because the discrepancy between price and value is so big, thus offering a great asymmetric investing opportunity!

[26-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <dpaulid> The news combined with the upgoing price will make outsiders (people that are not in King signals)  FOMO, this will make the coin rise even further. After this price rise, slowly sell your coins. Instead of one order, place a couple.
More people means a bigger rise in price which means a bigger profit. So, do not forget to invite people to our discord and Telegram.

[26-Sep-19 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> What wallet are you using? Chameleon is a really awesome mobile wallet. If you use that, you would open it up, and input the seed words when it asks for them, make sure your phone doesn't capitalize letters it shouldn't (your seed is case sensitive and must be copied exactly). After you input it all, activate the coins you have balances for, and live your best life like I know you will!

[telegram] <Regnar> I agree voting is a good one, I think tracking things will have to rely on willing participants, like in a supply chain. If a company doesn't scan their items and register on chain, the next supplier should reject those items. It will be effective then.

I want to use this opportunity to introduce  you to the man mr browny woosley, that has finally helped me turn my life around in binary options trading. Starting was a big step for me, finding someone who I can really rely on and trust as same time was the biggest problem. But today my joy has had no boundaries because i met him after reading lots of testimonies and post about him I start in a little capacity I can and today I get paid every 24hours of trade. It's amazing. Reach out to him to win big and recover your previous losses

[telegram] <Acura360> everyone Hold your hats!
The Komodo Team is pleased to present you the worlds first (pure) web-browser environment executed atomic swap! This means that we will eventually (soon) offer our users a pure web-based atomicDEX application which runs natively IN the web-browser without any external binaries or applications thus making atomicDEX available to pretty much all operating systems, platforms and devices.
Expect a dex.komodoplatform.com or web.atomicdex.io soon which basically offers you all the key features of atomicDEX mobile. This also means that the user data, private keys, etc. will always remain on the client-side and at no time will any sensitive data be transferred or stored on our servers. When a user visits the web-DEX URL the atomicDEX application will be loaded into the client/browser and then operates purely client-sided in a fully decentralised and blockchain based fashion. Special thanks to our DEX-core developers and blockchain architects Artem P. and Artem G. known as who turned a vision into reality, jl777 and the rest of the Komodo developer team. Exciting times are ahead!
Browser env swap details:

[telegram] <Mixic> Cool üòäüëç (re @Acura360: everyone Hold your hats!
The Komodo Team is pleased to present you the worlds first (pure) web-browser environment executed atomic swap! This means that we will eventually (soon) offer our users a pure web-based atomicDEX application which runs natively IN the web-browser without any external binaries or applications thus making atomicDEX available to pretty much all operating systems, platforms and devices.
Expect a dex.komodoplatform.com or web.atomicdex.io soon which basically offers you all the key features of atomicDEX mobile. This also means that the user data, private keys, etc. will always remain on the client-side and at no time will any sensitive data be transferred or stored on our servers. When a user visits the web-DEX URL the atomicDEX application will be loaded into the client/browser and then operates purely client-sided in a fully decentralised and blockchain based fashion. Special thanks to our DEX-core developers and blockchain architects Artem P. and Artem G. known as who turned a vision into reality, jl777 and the rest of the Komodo developer team. Exciting times are ahead!

[27-Sep-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Any chance to swap without using your wallet?

[27-Sep-19 04:25 PM] gcharang#6833
you can only trade coins you have added to the wallet
in the app, orders are only shown for coins with balances 
you can see all the orders here:  https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/
use the search bar to filter

[27-Sep-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You have to activate a coin to see the orderbook for that coin. And right now you need to have a balance to see the full orderbook for that pair. Ie, have KMD to see KMD/BTC book.
 We mentioned it to the devs to see if orderbook would be viewable without funds, but right now it doesn't make sense to do that as the App is a wallet with exchange function, it is meant to be used to swap coins you have for other coins. (re @deepblock: Any chance to swap without using your wallet?)

[27-Sep-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I believe there is a site that will specifically be using the Orderbook API that is available in order to display these, but right now the mobile app isn't doing this in order to prevent clutter

[telegram] <deepblock> Well, here how it goes. I have BTC on my jaxx wallet and I want to swap it to ETH - and receive it on Metamask (I have used this wallets as an example). Without depositing it to Atomic DEX application. Just use your platform for swap

[27-Sep-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> And I want to see orders without sending my funds. I'm not quite sure, if there are any orders on your Dex
