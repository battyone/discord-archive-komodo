Anyone else see this?
Direct quotes
 ‚ÄòEthereum [ETH] is now interoperable with Wanchain 2.0, an industry first‚Äô
‚ÄòTo solve this issue of interoperability, Wanchain has launched Wanchain 2.0 which will become the world‚Äôs first interoperable blockchain network‚Äô
Some of the statements I come across, that are made by the cryptocratic media outlets make me question their credibility.
In one breath Wanchain ‚Äúis now interoperable‚Äù
In the next breath Wanchain ‚Äú will become the worlds first interoperable blockchain‚Äù
It either is interoperable or it is not .

i think most holders are holding, the one that are selling are bots trying to maintain a little activity volume on exchange.

[25-Jul-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
