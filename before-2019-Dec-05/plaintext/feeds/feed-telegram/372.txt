I have no issues at the moment at Binance (re @pungoio: good afternoon, be aware that BINANCE is having some issues and they are rejecting withdrawals from their users.)

[25-Jun-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
60 seconds

default is to have private tx enabled

[25-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hhugh> I assume transaction fees for custom assets are paid via KMD... how do fees compare to a project like Stellar?

While mass buying, our social media specialists will spread bullish news on some massive social media channels. The news combined with the upgoing price will make outsiders (people that are not in LionSignals)  FOMO, this will make the coin rise even further. After this price rise, slowly sell your coins. Instead of one order, place a couple.
More people means a bigger rise in price which means a bigger profit. So, do not forget to invite people to our discord and Telegram.
