[telegram] <ca888_v1> Well- I looked at the price and finally pulled the plug on mining KMD. Over the last few weeks, electricity cost started to outstrip returns. Anyone have an idea about what's going to happen when all 200M coins are finally in circulation? is KMD going to rely on miners to validate transactions in return for dust? Will there be enough transactions on the network, and enough price of a coin, to make running a notary node profitable?

this whole push to make anon founders dox themselves is a result of some clever propaganda. if you think about the actual effect of it, you will realize there are more negatives than positives, even to investors, for a project that has many public figures who are running the project. which KMD has.
