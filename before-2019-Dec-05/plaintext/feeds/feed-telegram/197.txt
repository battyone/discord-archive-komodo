[telegram] <Regnar> Hey just to clarify, there is no minimum claim, but in order to accrue rewards at all you need at least 10 kmd. You can claim as often as you want in as small amounts as you want, however after claiming it takes 1 hour before rewards start to accrue again. And claiming costs a transaction. So claiming too often and you will be worse off. It's best to claim once a month at least (if you wait longer than a month it will stop accruing but you won't lose your rewards, just wont grow). But when you claim, there is no minimum you have to accrue before you claim. (re @Piet: Hey,
Is there a minimum claim with the agama wallet these days?)

[telegram] <Anthony> Can you give same explanation for daedalus. I downloaded it. My cards no are on mew and suspended. What shall I do next (re @sreinhardt: To be a little more specific, if you bring up Agama and go to the "Transaction" page and look at "Dest. Address" column or to the "Receive" page and look under adresses, they will either begin with "R" or "z". If you have any tokens in an adress that begins with "z" then you need to send them to another address. The protocol that handles  addresses that start with "z" from the past is being retired for a much better, more efficient, but not backward compatible protocol. Funds in the old "z" addresses can/will be lost if you don't move them. 
Agama wallet supports both types, R and z so you need to check to see which your funds are in.)
