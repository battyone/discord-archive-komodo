[12-Feb-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> you only have to move funds out of z-adress before fork

[12-Feb-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> z-address is private, and only possibly when using "native"

[12-Feb-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> so when you¬¥re using "lite mode" you don't have to do anything

[12-Feb-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> KMD forked all 40 chains in itts ecosystem and integrated sappling they hold the milestone for most and easiest pulled off fork in history and that is why its best tech , which is why i think it should be about 100x where it is , but I was cuyrious if we got a new partner .

[12-Feb-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> It could just be from the release of KOMODOS real life functions paper and scalability and other blockchain sollutions that make it the bets project in history , I wish i had more then 1000 of them I will , if it cools down , I missed a 500 fill by 10 satoshis at 1766

$KMD #KOMODO

Unfortunately dropped a bit further, however double bottom & support found at the 0.618-0.65 region & S/R flip there.

Breakout upwards.
Tested upper resistance 4 times.
Expecting to break out upwards now.
Next zone is 32-34K area.

$KMD has been in what seems to be an accumulation range for the last 200+ days. I think it is getting close to a breakout. Expecting a chain reaction that will lead to an impulsive move after the red block on 4H time frame is reclaimed.
