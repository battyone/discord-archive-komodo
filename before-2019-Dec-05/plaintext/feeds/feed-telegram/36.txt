[telegram] <Hermes08> I believe even more if you multiply

[25-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rr621801> okay

[25-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rr621801> i try adding space

[25-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rr621801> to all words

[25-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> yea but still. the most common and logical reason it is showing a different address is a different seed. and it can be a single space off, or letter off, etc. so if you wrote it down, the best bet is to type it in a notepad so you can see the letters and spaces, verify its what you wrote down. then highlight the whole thing and make sure the highlighter isn't including a space at the end (even if you don't have a space, sometimes it'll add one when you highlight)

[25-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> then copy in

[25-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> so what I will do is to take a little and when you have some spare time try different scenarios it should take you like around 3 hours at least

[25-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <rr621801> alright m out. thanks a lot for your help guys. much appreciated

[25-Jun-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> honestly try what I said first. it's less likely you put an extra space between every word (there should be 1 space)

[25-Jun-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Yeah no worries that's not the best but well we tried on helping I will try to get him to a resolution on the support desk

[25-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> Why would a similar seed open a wallet at all? Wouldn't one space different just not open the wallet if not created in the first place?

[25-Jun-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the privkey is based on the hash of the passphrase

[25-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> it's accessing "A wallet" just not the one you want, or one anyone uses (re @icoexplorer: Why would a similar seed open a wallet at all? Wouldn't one space different just not open the wallet if not created in the first place?)

[25-Jun-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
all passphrases has a hash

[25-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> The seed is like a private key each combination of words and spaces give you a different address...

[25-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> So every seed opens something?

[25-Jun-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes 2^256 different "wallets"

[25-Jun-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> I'm.guessing you get this alot

[25-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> its a way of seeing it I always recommend to use the one assigned by default by the wallet ...using a random set of words made by yourself is not as effective as a random seed suggested by the wallet...what happened to him can be caused because he wrote down his seed manually apparently he didn't copied it correctly so he can even have a double space between words or triple space if he was careless...in that moment or if he had an error

[25-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> This is very common for new users that don't know how to use and take care of their private keys...so we added a feature to let the user create a pin to save his address and access it through a password

[25-Jun-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> Maybe it's best for new users to use hardware wallet and not worry about the 5% until nano add that feature?

[25-Jun-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> I think you can be  as careless or careful with your funds at the end...it depends on how you see it..this is very normal in everyday type of software...we wouldn't have so many users with these errors if they read our guides and test the wallet and other dapps before doing transactions.

[25-Jun-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Some users just need to be a little more patient and try to see where the error occurred ...I have seen cases where they find the error and yeah it's always on their end...üòâ

[25-Jun-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> Yea I agree, people are very careless. Always best to triple check and test.

[25-Jun-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumtchak> Maybe the seed shoud be trim for whitespace by default don't you think ?
