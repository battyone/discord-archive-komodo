[telegram] <Regnar> EVERYONE!! please be careful if you have input a seed phrase into Coinomi windows wallet (not sure of which other versions have this security flaw too) but apparently Coinomi seed input sends your seed phrase, in clear text(not encrypted), to Google's servers to spell check. I haven't verified the issue but a Komodo Dev, Luke Childs, has and shared on his Twitter so I'm passing it along here.
https://twitter.com/lukechilds/status/1100613365850767360?s=20
And here's the reported incident.
