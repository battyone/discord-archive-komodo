[telegram] <Acura360> Revenue will be paid if the asset has earned 1 Million Dollar in fees (re @Zeehenk: I have a few Jumblr in my agama. Any word on when that's going to give revenue?)

[12-Mar-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Jumblr still gets the revshare from DEX. only when it accumulates $1 mil or more is a payout made. (re @Zeehenk: I have a few Jumblr in my agama. Any word on when that's going to give revenue?)

[12-Mar-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Bear market and current low usage has stymied that accumulation, but hopefully that changes on both fronts in the future.
