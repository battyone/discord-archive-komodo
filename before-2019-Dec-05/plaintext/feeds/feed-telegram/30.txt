Im only starting out small, looking to buy at 200 coins or so. As a project, is this seen as a very small amount towards starting a portfolio??

In case anyone thought @KomodoPlatform was only doing #Atomicswaps with $BTC protocol coins. @VitalikButerin @SatoshiLite The info is out there, $KMD does it all, just got to sometimes actually look when people tag you, it's not all BS $ETH giveawaysü§£ü§£ https://t.co/M...

[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> Reg maybe just some constructive criticism on your tweets. You put a lot of hashtags and $ signs and tag a lot of people so it frankly seems like spam . If you minimalised it, more people will read it and react. I know you‚Äôre stoked and you want everyone to see it but I think your messages are powerful enough in and of itself. Tag a few key players  or 1/2 hashtags . (re @Regnar: Make sure you like and retweet. Tag your favorite crypto pages too.

[telegram] <Khuzairee> So if i want to transfer bch and btc from exchange to agama,i just use the same address?bcoz i notice other asset address are difference ie dgb kmd (re @yorklab: Using Lite, all Komodo asset chain addresses are the same.)

[24-Jun-18 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ch6ris> Yes lite mode is the same address

[telegram] <ch6ris> For most coins some exceptions

[24-Jun-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Jun-18 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Iguana based address like KMD and its asset chains remain the same before making any transfer activate the coin on your Agama wallet and you will see the address , be careful with your funds. If you are using BCH you have to enable advanced features by going to settings and then clicking in the app config tab and activating it. (re @Khuzairee: So if i want to transfer bch and btc from exchange to agama,i just use the same address?bcoz i notice other asset address are difference ie dgb kmd)

[24-Jun-18 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> After this you should restart the wallet

[24-Jun-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Jun-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
bch should be a different address format, they changed it. barterDEX supports the new format, not sure if agama does yet

[24-Jun-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
