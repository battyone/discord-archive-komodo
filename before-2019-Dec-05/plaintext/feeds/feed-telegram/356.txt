Application-specific blockchains should be independent from the main chain both in their infrastructure and economic model. This is very hard to achieve. No platform provides truly sovereign blockchains today, except Komodo through the Antara Framework:

[telegram] <Ra> How is ZADDEX an hybrid it looked pretty centralized to me

[14-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> it will be under the same restrictions as a CEX , with same limits even worse so not sure it value to be honest

[14-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Hybrid sounds like zero sugar coke , it still poison

[14-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> At this time I believe it is just a CEX, when mm2 is ready for production I‚Äôm sure they will integrate

[14-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> so it not hybrid. it a CEX for now

[14-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Will be better if you ask directly Zaddex (re @Ra: so it not hybrid. it a CEX for now)

[14-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> not really it ownt change the fact, that it still pocesses the risk of CEX exchanges and under the same regulation

[14-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> and it not an Hybrid just a diet coke , but even worse as it a new CEX exchange with no SAFU insurance

[14-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> Zaddex develop into a hybrid exchange platform
by combining the benefits of centralized and
decentralized technology to solve current problems
faced with DEX and CEX trading platforms.
The 1st version to be released will be a semicentralized exchange going to a DEX. (re @Ra: How is ZADDEX an hybrid it looked pretty centralized to me)

[14-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> it would have made sense is they wait for mm2 launch and implemented

[14-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> as that is not true , it a CEX first and foremost it like binance calling it self an hybrid

[14-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> users will see the false statement anyways they are not stupid

[14-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Building a hybrid exchange, requires both pieces,  cex and dex,  it is not unreasonable to start with the former.

[14-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> That's fine, but it seems the user was referring to calling it a Hybrid or dex. If it was called ZEX, a centralized exchange that will evolve into a DEX there probably wouldn't be any misunderstanding. (re @polycryptoblog: Building a hybrid exchange, requires both pieces,  cex and dex,  it is not unreasonable to start with the former.)

[14-Jun-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Ra> Most of admin sound like payed employees , at least PTYX made a valid objective input, there is a saying "never fully trust a man on a salary they will say anything to keep the cheese coming in"

[14-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> most of admin have that employee stench , not that it bad , but sometimes it ignors the fact and reality of some situations

[14-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> If you look at it from the marketer's standpoint, calling it a CEX or saying "it's a cex that will evolve into a dex" doesn't have much marketing value. I can understand why they went with that narrative. Same as Binance. (re @Ra: most of admin have that emplyee stench , not that it bad , but sometimes it ignors the fact and reality of some situations)

[14-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> My concern is more with security. If Binance got hacked what makes ZEX more or equally secure?

[14-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Yes I alluded to that,  that it cannot be safer than binance as it have no safu funds so if it hacked it done and it not large enough to weather regulations , I suggest they just wait for mm2 and  implement it

[14-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> but saying hybrid exchange suggest it safer than CEX which is not true and deciving users or pretty much calling them stupid , marketing must think users are stupid
