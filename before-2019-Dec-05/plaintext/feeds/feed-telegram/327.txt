Create new seed with verus wallet. Use your old seed in Chameleon. Send funds from seed in Chameleon to the new address in Verus wallet. That works (re @Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe: So I did the following now:

[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> I thank the Komodo devs for this step! It's the right way to address and fix a problem before everyone knows it, I find more than serious! Bravo Komodo 👌 Just like the vulnerability a few months ago that the devs of KMD, Zcash & Verus secretly fixed under a cover of "conversion" before the big bad badboys could exploit it! I fully rely on the DEVS!!!

[05-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> After all their coins are back, Komodo will get more trust than ever before. Very very good work!

[05-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Make a new seed and address with a different wallet from the safe methods listed above. After you have a new seed and address, use your old seed (the ones you generated on the vulnerable Agama) to try the Agama web wallet, then send your coins to your new address (that you created with a different wallet). 
Agama web should be sufficient to send funds from without the screen going blank, but priority is getting funds out of the addresses you created with vulnerable agama (re @Ovidiu: When i try to acces agama by komodo the screen turns white)

[telegram] <Regnar> Nah. More like Agama had a bug that could have been exploited maliciously. The Komodo team used that bug to secure people's funds from vulnerable addresses before an attacker used it to steal funds. 
Can you imagine if Komodo tried to push a fix to Agama before an attacker used the bug? There's tens of thousands of agama users that would have all had to update immediately, and just pushing the fix would have triggered an attacker to make their move right away. (re @xarux: agama hacked!)

[05-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Your new seed should obviously be empty right now, it's a fresh address. Using your old seed in agama web should show the same address you've always had, balance, and transaction history. If you don't see transaction history or the same address it's likely you input the seed wrong. If you see all that and the balance is missing, check to see if it was sent to this address:

Use this to see what coins are still in your old address. You should move all of them asap. Komodo only swept KMD and BTC as they were the most likely to be attacked. Anything that's still in those addresses is vulnerable and should be moved. 
If you own the keys, you can still get the RFOX if you send to Verus, however you can send to another RFOX supported wallet. (re @Ovidiu: Can i send them to verus wallet eventough it doesnt dispaly redfox?)
