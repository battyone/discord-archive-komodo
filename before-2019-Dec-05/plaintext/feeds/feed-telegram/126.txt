[telegram] <blade4383> Just asking it again... is it better to claim frequently i.e. less than 10KMDs or when the claim becomes >10 KMDs... because any transaction of 10 or above would also generate interest (re @ca232: y = 1.1539x**0.4932 where x is KMD held and y is claims per year)

[telegram] <blade4383> Ok.. thats what I was thinking... because I read it somewhere to claim once a month... my interest gets over 10 in more than a month so wanted clarity what is official word on this üòä (re @Hermes08: As long as you claim above 10 KMD you will be good)

[08-Sep-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <blade4383> Just checked it... there is a change post 1mil blocks... will have to claim monthly ... and the wallet should have more than 10KMD to get interest and NOT each claim tx to be 10 KMD or more (re @blade4383: Thanks üôè will do)
