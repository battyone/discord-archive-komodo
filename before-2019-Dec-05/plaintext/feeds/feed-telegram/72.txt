[telegram] <LAP> I wonder.
45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.
However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second?

[telegram] <mo7881> When money is turning to dust i think you learn how to open a wallet. I dont think their government are capable of fixing this and the market already has the solution. I would have imagine we would have seen mass adoption by now (re @Hermes08: but mostly baby boomers don't even know how to use a PC correctly so)

[telegram] <Hermes08> Fibre coin , haven't heard of it . Is it an asset chain? Or are you referring to it being traded on Barterdex? (re @Ashton_poloniex: Admin, do you know you any news on FIBRE coin? or is there a place i can look? will there be a relaunch)

[telegram] <LAP> I wonder.
45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.
However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second? (re @Acura360: https://twitter.com/baboongasser/status/1022493386941648897?s=12)
