[telegram] <Nostradamus411> Question to the room, can Komodo support atomic swaps with Cryptonote/Cryptonight coins (Bytecoin, Monero, ect) ? 
If not, is it something on the teams radar?

[11-Sep-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I'm interested to see how they implement it

[11-Sep-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Nostradamus411> Ditto

[11-Sep-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Nostradamus411> They say zksnaks when referencing monero though...so they seem confused

[11-Sep-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> They are likely adding wallet support and then having swap functions using changelly or shapeshift, not likely atomic swaps, I've been pretty disappointed by their advertising which to me comes off as disingenuous, especially because it seems like a great wallet. They have multiple swap functions, Atomic Swaps are just one of them, and I doubt theirs will support Monero. It will likely be the use of 3rd party middlemen, and just called atomic swaps :/

[11-Sep-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ic> Does that mean komodo don't support atomic swap with Monero at the moment ? (re @PTYX11: I'm interested to see how they implement it)

[telegram] <Ic> So it's the remaining 5% I guess ? Any time frame when we can support all ? (re @PTYX11: Barterdex doesn't support cryptonotes yet)

[11-Sep-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> When the Monero devs help us implement them I guess. It's unfeasible to spend resources to add every coin when it would be 10 times easier if the devs themselves helped to be added
