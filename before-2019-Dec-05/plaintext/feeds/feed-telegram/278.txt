[telegram] <PTYX11> @Marcauj if it says autoelected 2, it means they got two nodes that are autoelected from the last year

[18-Apr-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> they are running for more in a different region

[18-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> I see thanks guysl

[18-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> So voters can still vote for autoelected NN ?

[18-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> this bit is confusing me

[18-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> yes they can

[18-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> Thanks Charles üëç (re @PTYX11: yes they can)

[18-Apr-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
many voters want to have as decentralized NN as possible so wont vote for anybody that has a spot

[18-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> Indeed, I just don't see the point of voting for a NN that is guaranteed to be reelected, I must be missing something

[18-Apr-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
there are 4 independent regions

[18-Apr-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
one NN operator can have at most 1 node in all 4 regions

[18-Apr-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
either by autoelection or by winning a spot in the election

[18-Apr-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
since no node got autoelected in all 4 regions, that means all that got reelected are eligible to run in at least one other region

[18-Apr-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
there are basically 4 elections going on in parallel

[18-Apr-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> 1 candidate can run at 4 different regions. So basically if I won North America and got reelected for good performance, I can now run for South America next year.

[18-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You can't vote for the reelected node. You can vote for the same operator in a different region.

[18-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> I see! That's clear now, thanks again guys

oracles CC can create services like chainlink. trustless oracles creates something that chainlink does not appear to be able to as it is using a complex system of rewards/punishments for aggregating data, which if properly implemented and debugged could well make it impractical to attack

[19-Apr-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <a44753> Is it false?

[19-Apr-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i did code the solution to the trustless oracle problem in a weekend, but i did have to spend the entire week before it thinking about it

[19-Apr-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and there were a couple weeks to debug it: http://159.69.45.70:8050/

[19-Apr-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt very fancy but it implements trustless oracle pricefeeds for 55 things, since I added support for stocks too and custom chains can be made to track any set of desired stocks and cryptos and forex currencies

[19-Apr-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but out solution is totally different than chainlink. it was inspired by the ruthless attack scenarios by zack (of VEO, aeternity, augur?) i think he did augur not sure on that one. anyway his position is that you cant aggregate data to make a trustless oracle

[19-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <a44753> Cool! So if I understand well only price feeds can get aggregated on chain?

[19-Apr-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
not correct

[19-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <a44753> This is what I don‚Äôt understand

[19-Apr-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
in a weekend I was only able to oraclize price feeds

[19-Apr-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but the technique I used can be applied to any data source that is publicly available on the internet via api

[19-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <a44753> Sounds interesting

[19-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <a44753> Will take a deeper look into it

[19-Apr-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i just piggybacked onto how timestamps are enforced to be within a reasonable range

[19-Apr-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
baked it right into the consensus logic for a block

[19-Apr-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so there doesnt need to be any incentive/punishment/reputation system

[19-Apr-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont have reasonable prices, it is rejected and if your node continues, it is banned

[19-Apr-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so if reasonable timestamps can be enforced, so can reasonable prices

[19-Apr-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
that was my insight

[19-Apr-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
and to prove it, I implemented it

[19-Apr-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
I didnt bother with any indepth whitepaper as it seems selfevident that if any bad data make a node go off onto its own fork, then there is really no way to get bad data into the oracle

[19-Apr-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a 2% attack that is possible, and this is mitigated by a 51% deterministic random correlation
