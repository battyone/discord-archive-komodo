[telegram] <Buralux> 7 kmd as reward for 25k?? Good job?

[03-Oct-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Really strange. I did not understand how they made calculation. One of my friend received around 200 kmd for 10k. (re @Buralux: For all who have KMD in binance as stacking, be aware, calculation for award are very strange, for 25k I receipt 7kmd,)

[03-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> So you had to receive much more

[03-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> I'm curious, did you check your deposit address balance in a block explorer? Did you send that much KMD or did you Buy it on Binance? (re @Buralux: I ask support if there is a mistake, they respond me no.)

[03-Oct-19 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Buralux> Yes already checked, did send all from my ledger 2months ago (re @Regnar: I'm curious, did you check your deposit address balance in a block explorer? Did you send that much KMD or did you Buy it on Binance?)

[04-Oct-19 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Hmm on the blockchain, the transaction you sent to deposit it, is there any value in "locktime" field? (re @Buralux: Yes already checked, did send all from my ledger 2months ago)

[04-Oct-19 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Buralux> Will deposit transaction thank you regnar

[04-Oct-19 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Buralux> Check

[04-Oct-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I'm curious if Binance is handling transactions that don't have locktime set. The rewards only accrue if locktime is set, Ledger I don't believe sets it on outbound transactions (all Komodo ecosystem wallets do set this) and so the transaction wouldn't accrue any rewards, so Binance may not have given you any more than the 7.
I'm guessing the first rewards airdrop Binance did was not the same as reward accruing. They probably just distributed past earnings to everyone who has a balance (I think they even said if you had even 1 KMD you would get rewards) but that isn't how the Komodo rewards works (re @Buralux: Check)

[04-Oct-19 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So if that's the case, then right now there are only certain wallets accruing rewards.

[04-Oct-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Buralux> Exactly this rewards üëá

[04-Oct-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I don't remember how they did the airdrop distribution calculation

[04-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Buralux> Cause the first reward was accumulation of 1year kmd

[04-Oct-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Not sure when you deposited there but your balance should only be getting like 107 KMD a month. So you scored on the first airdrop it seems, but the 7 is weird

[telegram] <omg_gawd> Just never leave staking coins on binance but in the own Wallet (re @Buralux: 7 kmd as reward for 25k?? Good job?)

[04-Oct-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think it has to do with their policy that all balances receive awards. So even smaller than 10 KMD balances, while not actually earning anything, will receive rewards. So basically those smaller balances receive funds they didn't actually earn (re @Keytothegate: I reported this already on the first binance give-away and staking period and did some calculations. Came to conclusion that there is something weird regarding binance staking, probably some accounts are more equal than others meaning some get more some get less for reasons unknown)

[04-Oct-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> And it could also be they may not set locktime on all deposits, so if I deposit 1000 kmd from a wallet without setting locktime, they may not set it with a transaction to themselves (I haven't verified if they don't do this) but that could seriously affect things.
Would lower their total rewards amount, which then gets split among all holders

[telegram] <Regnar> "The Komodo team continues to focus efforts on AtomicDEX. This week, the Dev Team announced the very first atomic swap executed from a purely web-browser-based environment, which is a huge milestone. While AtomicDEX is already a cutting-edge product that provides an extremely high level of security, the web-browser version of AtomicDEX will be even more secure. This is true because the web version of AtomicDEX will run exclusively on the client side, meaning no data or information is ever transferred to or relayed through¬†AtomicDEX servers."

The marketing team is preparing an update to the AtomicDEX site, which is currently a simple one-page product display site. The update will include refreshed visuals,¬†sharper messaging, and additional pages, such as an AtomicDEX blog. The goal is to develop AtomicDEX as a sister brand, rather than a child brand or a sub-brand, of Komodo. Progress also continues on market maker tools, on the desktop version of AtomicDEX, on integrating new assets, and on finding partner projects to provide liquidity or integrate the atomic swap protocol via the AtomicAPI."

[04-Oct-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I can maybe help with that. Komodo is a very tech-focused project, and it shows. It‚Äôs kinda ‚Äúcold‚Äù like a server rack, it‚Äôs space technology but not very friendly for newcomers. Komodo is difficult to understand and explain. It is targeted to developers and enterprises.
AtomicDEX should be different, friendly, approachable, inviting for ‚Äúnormal people‚Äù. So we will change the messaging a little bit, change the design a little bit too, to make it, well, more approachable. AtomicDEX aims to gain millions of users eventually, it‚Äôs consumer product.
