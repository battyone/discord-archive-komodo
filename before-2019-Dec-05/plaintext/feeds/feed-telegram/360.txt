we are soon to have more refunds than we swept, which means it is costing me KMD to do the refunds. without the privkey, it cant be proven it is his funds. that is the issue

[telegram] <miguelborges99> I did not found this so fantastic and I think some people either... I do not want to be a cheerleader. This was a big defeat for komodo. How can an official wallet has this kind of hack? The image that I've from komodo was a great group of developers, one of the best teams in crypto,  but this hack makes me rethink. How crypto community will see komodo now?

A similar hack happened on other crypto JS wallets in the past (BTC, XVG, ...). I am very proud to be part of KMD community : KMD team took difficult decisions to protect user funds. Other crypto didn't protect users as jl777 (and KMD team) is doing. Congrats for your awesome work and involvment jl777, I've never seen this in cryptoworld

[16-Jun-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810

[16-Jun-19 02:38 PM] phm87#7395
I though it was 732k but I won't verify as you'll pay/reimburse everything (incredible but true).

[16-Jun-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it was 732k
