[04-Nov-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Info from User Polycryptoblog:
During the test we were intentionally spamming the network with swaps to identify bottlenecks in transaction capacity.¬† We have gained valuable insights and are in the process of utilizing them to optimize various areas of the DEX.¬† ¬†To give some perspective , the volume on one orderbook (RICK/MORTY) was around 100k order requests or about that of a BTC/USDT pair on a large exchange.¬† Original MM1 handled 3x this capacity without issue and we expect to be able to optimize the current MM2 to do even more.

Just because an exchange is slightly less centralized than a fully centralized exchange doesn‚Äôt mean we should call it a #DEX.

There are at least 4 core requirements that an exchange must meet before we should consider it ‚Äúdecentralized.‚Äù

[05-Nov-19 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> We have zero say in how Binance distributes rewards, you'll have to talk directly with their support staff. Their historic yields show 0.2683% this month, but 18.23% in September. KMD only accrues.5.1% a year. So idk how they are doing their rewards. Best to check (re @Kriptodan Batan Adam: Acura, will u ask komodo team why distributing rewards is very low?)

[05-Nov-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> This is always an option and is what most people do in order to get more rewards (re @Ggokhangark: Absolutely right. They are just fucking kidding with us. I am going to take all of my kmd from binance soon.)

[05-Nov-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Let's not say Binance is scamming people, first of all they openly show the rates KMD holders are earning. Currently states "0.2683%". You would earn more off the exchange based on how they are calculating rewards, which I'm not sure of how they are, but has been speculated about a lot already (use search function in here)
Here is the link to Binance KMD rewards page:
https://www.binance.com/en/staking/products/332609e29e17488b93b8919e5cebb536
Remember, everything is on chain so you can find Binance wallets (maybe not all their wallets) and see when they claim rewards to check how much they are claiming

It‚Äôs not staking :) it‚Äôs to reward users for being active

[05-Nov-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Staking is term  that is related to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.  Active User Rewards do not take part in consensus

[05-Nov-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Nov-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Nov-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> I agree , but it is misleading

[05-Nov-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EXCCellent> true.

[05-Nov-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Goose432> I dont understand it fully, but its very cool to generate rewards without having to run a wallet, setup masternode or sync up a blockchain

[05-Nov-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EXCCellent> True staking has something to do to secure the network, to validate transaction.

[05-Nov-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EXCCellent> For Komodo , to receive 'rewards' there also is no locking of coins. As some require coins to be locked for period of time to be eligible for 'rewards'.

[05-Nov-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EXCCellent> Komodo coins are always available to spend, with out penalties.

[05-Nov-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Yep it is centered around user action for many reasons.  The main goal of it though is for early adopters ( 13 years is that time frame , if you haven‚Äôt found KMD in 13 years , too bad lol ) a way to contribute to the health of the network.   Transactions are needed on a network for many reasons and coin production to be solely in the hands of miners instead of both miners and users for an ICO coin has its issues as an economic system.   So combining those two we had a way for users to contribute to komodos utility
