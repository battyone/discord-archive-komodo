[telegram] <mc_crypto> You think? So people would rather PAY to use a Turing complete solution, opposed to one that doesn‚Äôt charge anywhere near as much to utilize the majority of operation? (re @Seppe: The team Is working on these problems. Once they Will solve these issues, there Will be no reason to build on Komodo)

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Donnie> when i tried again it said ‚Äò wallet maintenance ‚Äò (re @mc_crypto: Ya, Binance is notorious for hour-long withdrawals. BTC takes at least an hour for me usually. try checking your email for a auth action)

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seppe> More adoption Is more demand of ether. (re @mc_crypto: "largely" adopted‚Äî>forseeable profits
mind explaining the function above?)

[telegram] <Hateus> Binance is having server maintenance atm

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Donnie> Yes me too (re @Werxadler: For me it took never longer than 5 minutes)

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mc_crypto> So yeah, Binance problem. But don‚Äôt worry, funds are safu (re @Donnie: when i tried again it said ‚Äò wallet maintenance ‚Äò)

ETH cannot scale

[07-May-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
period

[07-May-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
if it scales, GAS goes go up

[07-May-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
THAT alone prevents it from scaling

[07-May-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Werxadler> The better projects change to their own blockchain though (re @Seppe: More adoption Is more demand of ether.)

[07-May-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly ETH can remove the ETH tax, by totally changing how it is structured. in a sense it wouldnt be ETH anymore, just a new crypto that has the same name
