[telegram] <Aleska Cebrera> Success is by choice, life is all about taking risk, with the help of Mr smart Wilson , binary trading platform has been successful all the way. I sit back and watch my profit grow daily and easily withdrew my profit myself from the broker... If you ain't making money while you sleep then you ain't building your financial future.... Only people with great zeal to excel financially will embarrass this opportunity with great value....if you are looking for legit and honest account manager.

[telegram] <PTYX11> the DEX as it's architectured currently falls within the legal framework that establishes it as a non-regulated type of exchange (re @RegulusR: So the point regarding AtomicDex Threat is wrong.)

[12-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> that's not to say the law won't change in the future, but the atomicdex is as resilient as torrents. in fact, the transactions are broadcasted through a torrent network from what i understand. maybe someone can correct me if i'm wrong.
