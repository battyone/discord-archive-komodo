[telegram] <Ming Êòé> I mean the exchange section on coinomi not show barterdex

[01-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> I'm saying that since the beginning, but it is not as easy as it sounds. (re @mo7881: Think we need a hyperdex mobile wallet, with swaps done on the wallet)

[01-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> Some sort of komodo multi wallet like coinomi

[01-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> Then cut out 3rd party exchanges - do all the transfers with atomic swaps

[01-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Constantini21> I think that too (re @mo7881: Think we need a hyperdex mobile wallet, with swaps done on the wallet)

[01-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Constantini21> But coinomi doesn't support hyperDex (re @emman_utrum: )

[01-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming Êòé> that my point üôÇ (re @Constantini21: But coinomi doesn't support hyperDex)

[01-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Hyperdex is decentralized , Shapeshift and all the others are centralized (re @mo7881: Think we need a hyperdex mobile wallet, with swaps done on the wallet)

[01-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> The problem with atomic swaps is reputation. You need to trust your counterparty to some extent if you want to sacrifice your time (and potentially some money) doing the swap, and you need to care about your reputation if you're going to do that.

[01-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Centralized Exchanges have restrictions, AML Policy etc..

[01-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Crypto social networks like Utrum are the solution, imo, to the reputation problem on atomic swaps.

[01-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming Êòé> i think kmd with mobile app exchange will make prople more easier to access to crypto and KMD

[01-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming Êòé> mass adoption will faster

[01-Aug-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Like Monero? 
I think it's actually the opposite. Privacy capabilities increase the volume, interest from the public and price. (re @JamPhish: Uuhh - that's what we call a cop out.

[telegram] <emman_utrum> Huh... if there were a way, it wouldn't be truly decentralized. (re @JamPhish: So again, my valid question - Is there a means of voting to remove Dapps?)

[01-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Just because something is Decentralized, does not mean the Community has Zero Say.
Wow!
Fiat is backed by Governments . . . 
Crypto is backed by Communities . . . 
If the Community backing the Crypto is POWERLESS to affect that Crypto - the value to most of the WORLD IS ZERO
Obviously, the value toward the illegal World would be greater (re @emman_utrum: Huh... if there were a way, it wouldn't be truly decentralized.)

[01-Aug-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Bottom line is: NEO needs to be vetted, because it is monolithic. 
Komodo is modular, and therefore, truly free. You can really do whatever you want with it.

[telegram] <JamPhish> Bitcoin as a Currency has failed.  The Governments and Enterprises are calling it a Comodity.  For that, it will be treated as such.  Bitcoin has too large a Market Cap currently for Private Investors to really move it.  We will see Wall Street eventually rule Bitcoin by issuing BTC to Oil, BTC to Gold, BTC to Wheat, BTC to Uranium . . . it will become a globally accepted store of value - that's it.  
Lightning Network only handles 2% of transactions and ONLY Functions in a Non-Hostile Environment.  Also, Lightning relies on TRUSTED Master Nodes who act as a care taker of funds - legally - this would have to  be a trusted 3rd Party and do a KYC for each user.  In addition, Lightning Requires Sender / Receiver to always be online for transactions to go thru - this is very limiting.  Also, enough transactions have been lost in Lightning, to scare anyone who would ever wish to send a large Sum.
