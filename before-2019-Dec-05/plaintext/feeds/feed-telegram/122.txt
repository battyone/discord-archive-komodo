[telegram] <Gudneh> Is it safe to use ledger nano with the agama wallet?

[29-Aug-18 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Gudneh> I see some warning saying that it can expose my seed?

[29-Aug-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> I will say that is safe as long as your enviorment hasn't been compromised, people mostly do the procedure of retrieving their private keys offline.

[29-Aug-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Gudneh> For me to receive the active user rewards can't I just transfer the funds to a new agama wallet get the rewards and then move them back?

[29-Aug-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> yes and no. to get rewards the KMD needs to be in your agama wallet, they accrue slowly, 0.0069 % per hour .
You can transfer to Agama, get rewards over time and send them back to Ledger whenever you want, but once they are in your ledger you wont get rewards going forward. (re @Gudneh: For me to receive the active user rewards can't I just transfer the funds to a new agama wallet get the rewards and then move them back?)

[29-Aug-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Gudneh> ah ok, I guess I might as well wait for a software update on ledgers part then

[29-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> dont hold your breath, It depends how much you have. If its more than a few thousand then get the rewards. otherwise its just a few dollars a year if you are not comfortable keeping it on agama. (re @Gudneh: ah ok, I guess I might as well wait for a software update on ledgers part then)

[29-Aug-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
