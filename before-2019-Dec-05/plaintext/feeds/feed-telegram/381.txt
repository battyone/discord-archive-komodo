[telegram] <Regnar> Yea Binance I dont think sets the locktime (re @Dave: I read something online about making sure the transaction had a locktime on it and it does.)

[03-Jul-19 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think ledger may set it if you send the balance to yourself. I'm not 100% ledger does. The other option which I think will work better is you could use the claim tool.

[04-Jul-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Jul-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> July 15 is like a year away in crypto. Plus it probably won‚Äôt move the price much. Maybe it will later. Who knows. (re @zahaliya: I really don't understand, it should be an opportunity to build a warehouse for the July 15 release, but why the price continues to fall.)

[04-Jul-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zahaliya> Seriously, I really appreciate the technical level and team quality of KOMODO, and the products are also very good, so I think the current price is seriously underestimated, and really need some external strength to improve.
