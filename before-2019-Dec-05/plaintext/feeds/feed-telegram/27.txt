[telegram] <Regnar> Thank you haha again i understand projects that focus on their product, that's what we want, we don't want devs absolutely beholden to investor demands otherwise we'll have too much short term influence trying to sway the price short term for quick flips, which actually hurts long term prospects. But that doesn't mean devs shouldn't take into account the investors at all. I think Komodo does a good job of striking this balance. The efforts being made are real and tangible in order to benefit everyone, and marketing department is a fully funded entity designed to help investors via product knowledge and adoption. But it can still feel like shit to open blockfolio and see red. So I totally understand that, which is why I try and explain things like this, rationally for an investor. There are risks to investing in vapor, it's much better to invest in legit projects, regardless of what charts say, simply because that vapor will disappear eventually and all that will remain is projects with strong networks, strong tech, unique capabilities, and hashing power. (re @N21_0: no comments
the truth I find in your words is true And you know about community affairs
thank you you are really wonderful)

The community front (i'm not a team member, just active community member) we still need more help in, and would love more members to step up and do things like talk about Komodo on Social media, share and like pro KMD posts. tag their favorite influencers etc. 
Hope this provides some more insight for you.)

[telegram] <blockfolionatew> Hi, I'm a dev from Blockfolio. I was wondering if an admin here could reach out to the dev team and ask for a recommended endpoint to retrieve currency pairs, prices, and if possible trade histories.  We're currently using this endpoint https://www.atomicexplorer.com/api/mm/prices to get currency pairs and prices, but the information from there may not be accurate.  Thanks.

then brings in the other problems of fiat; govts control those fiats and the laws/regulations that attach to them; thus, mitigating every primary reason for crypto*currency*

[22-Jun-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the real concern shouldn't be "How do we bring fiat into crypto?", the real question is "How do we get from here to a point where crypto is recognized as curreny?"

withdraw is a misnomer, as all funds you have in barterDEX are basically already withdrawn as you control the funds. Only the p2sh funds for swaps in progress are not in your control, just until the atomic swap protocol completes
