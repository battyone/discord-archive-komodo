[telegram] <Regnar> I'm just gonna keep holding until I NEED to sell. Nothing like having financial security and rewards will continue for another 12-14 years or w.e. I'll keep working my job, building cool stuff that makes some money and helps Komodo community, and stack sats. Crypto is NOT my primary source of income or largest investment.

[22-Mar-19 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But its definitely the investment I'm most active in. Been helping Komodo out since mid 2017, invested back in earlier 2017. :D

[telegram] <DrgnAngel> I use Delta app to track all my KMD buys, see how much I’ve put in, avg buy price, etc. For the fit time I will be claiming Free KMD interest.

[telegram] <kirikou> I use bituniverse to do so. I add free kmd by adding the number of kmd with a 0 value. Delta sucks for this (re @DrgnAngel: I use Delta app to track all my KMD buys, see how much I’ve put in, avg buy price, etc. For the fit time I will be claiming Free KMD interest.

[22-Mar-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t0sma> Try Add new transaction then transfert on the top right. You have choice. I use dividende for KMD rewards or mining.

[22-Mar-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> because I expected something more natural ... but I'm seeing more of the same in all the cryptos. Some smart come days before and the value barely moves until the day comes and there are no sales, they rise to a new maximum and the first ones that enter are put to sell.
If you hold hold so you are in telegram? If you go in the long term, it does not make sense to be on time for the telegram, enjoy life rather than be wasting time in a rigged game. Do not you think?
