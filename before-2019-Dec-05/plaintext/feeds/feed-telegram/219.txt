[telegram] <Regnar> Lol it affected ETH price because all the projects were forced to use ETH to even do anything, sure the price went up, but then a bunch of kittens showed the world how inefficient of a model it was. Price will move more, it moved 40% in a week in a bear market. (re @Clincaruto: Just saying. When eth blockchain was widely used as smart contract. It really affected the demand and price . but in  our komodo. We see really nice updates. Not just updates but actually working products of komodo services to other projects. And not affecting the demand and price)

[telegram] <Thacryptobear> Pos* (re @Thacryptobear: So kmd is a hypbrid pow and possibly?)

[21-Feb-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Thacryptobear> Cause there are miners and notary nodes ?

[21-Feb-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Thacryptobear> What is kmd's monetary supply?

[21-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Thacryptobear> Ok wait. So the inflation created is paid to people staking in their wallets right? 5% every month? (re @Thacryptobear: What is kmd's monetary supply?)

[21-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Thacryptobear> And if I'm right staking stops when the supply reaches 200 million

[21-Feb-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Yes... (re @Thacryptobear: And if I'm right staking stops when the supply reaches 200 million)

[21-Feb-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Thacryptobear> Ok but how do miners and notary nodes interact?

[21-Feb-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Notary Nodes get the biggest share of block rewards, cause they have lower difficulty (by design, this is to pay for their services) (re @Thacryptobear: Ok but how do miners and notary nodes interact?)

[21-Feb-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Regular miners get a smaller share

[21-Feb-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> But  I don't know the numbers

[21-Feb-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> You'll have to ask Google (or wait someone more knowledgeable than me to fill in the blanks...)

[21-Feb-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Notary nodes are not masternodes, their hardware and uptime requirements are much higher (re @TonyStarkBR: Notary Nodes get the biggest share of block rewards, cause they have lower difficulty (by design, this is to pay for their services))

[21-Feb-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> So their services must be paid somehow, and it's done by giving than a lower mining difficulty

[21-Feb-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Thacryptobear> Mining rewards and node rewards and earned through transaction fees only or something else?

[21-Feb-19 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Feb-19 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
