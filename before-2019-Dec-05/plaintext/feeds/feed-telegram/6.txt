[telegram] <cloudyoncall> thank you!

[12-Jun-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> oh yes i watched that one

[12-Jun-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> still hopeless

[12-Jun-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> guess i haven't wrapped my head around UTXO yet

[12-Jun-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> so i'll watch that one

[12-Jun-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> what do max utxo size and utxo sum mean in the sellers tab, and what do they mean in the buyers tab? because in buyers, for each price, the utxo size and sum are both 0

[12-Jun-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> and i want to sell

[12-Jun-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> in this case when you make an order you won't see none in the order you set up , but liquidity providers already have a history and that's the average utxo size they have most of the time, if you are not seeing that type of information populating in other orders is because they are also normal users that' don't have so much trades or in this case they are not liquidty providers.

[12-Jun-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> you should try to match the utxos size for trades depending on what pair you are swapping , you can do this by using the make inventory option next the coin you want to swap

[12-Jun-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> so the buyers with 0 utxo size and sum, are not able to be filled? what then is the purpose of their bids?

[12-Jun-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> they can be filled remember because of it being peer to peer and in many trades users don't have a long trading history it can take some time for that depth and that utxos columns to be updated

[12-Jun-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> if you want to test this before doing a trade you can use the beer and pizza faucet in order to get some initial trades going on

[telegram] <cloudyoncall> hmm ok thanks

[12-Jun-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cloudyoncall> one more question.. if it's peer to peer does that mean if i put a order in and close barterdex it won't remain?

[12-Jun-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
best to use hyperDEX, it is much  simpler to use
