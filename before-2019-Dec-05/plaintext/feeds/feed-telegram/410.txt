[telegram] <Regnar> Considering my post is from a while back, it just goes to show you how common this scam is. People say they want to trade? No problem. Use AtomicDEX or exchange. People give the "banned in my country" excuse they are getting banned.

[10-Oct-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Remember everyone, if someone offers you a deal here through escrow, it's a scam. Admin here will NOT escrow trades, so if they say they are getting me, or any other admin here to escrow the trade, it is a lie. They likely made another account and named it and use the same profile icon like one of the admins to trick you.
Do NOT trade with people here. They will say "Crypto is illegal in my country" etc, Do NOT trade with them. They are lying to you to steal your money.
