[telegram] <Regnar> We'll let the market decide that ;) (re @emmanux: those are test coins. They have zero value. If you paid something for them you've been scammed.)

[15-Jun-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> they also aren't necessarily notarized, so they can suffer a 51% attack, those are pretty popular these days.

[15-Jun-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> appreciate it. I was wondering if it was something like they own the miners and can pull the plug or change details at any time, or if they wrote something into the protocol (re @emmanux: I searched through the docs, but nothing relevant about them.)

[15-Jun-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> It can be reset by the notary node network.

[15-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> okay cool. just curiosity as normal

[15-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> if someone really wants to assign them value... well, i think that someone will start mining it in order to preserve that investment... and notaries could just accept the new (re-)born coins.

[slack] <CHMEX> The 0.15% is for the t-z   and z-t iterration so its 0.30% in total fees its collected at RGhxXpXSSBTBm9EvNsXnTQczthMCxHX91t  once it accumulated a hold of approx 1mio usd its paid as dividends to JUMBLR holders.

[telegram] <LAP> Komodo block generation cycle is 1 minute. Does that mean I can not contract in one second? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> and it will be 1 mil  tx/sec, i think 8 mil payments/sec is also possible at lower tx/sec)

[15-Jun-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <LAP> And Komodo roadmap states that the development of smart contracts will start after 2019. Does tx of "20k tx / sec" mean smartcontract?

[15-Jun-18 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
smart contract work is in testing now, we just wanted to have plenty of time to get things all sorted so the 2019 is a conservative timeframe

[15-Jun-18 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the realtime tx is not yet, the scaling is using normal blockchains, just a lot of them

[telegram] <Jakub> When can we expect price of kmd go up? Project is shining much more than other projects but price is going drastically down (btc bear market by the way but price going down in btc value too). Kmd lost 11x price worth when btc lost 3,5.

[15-Jun-18 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
need to wait for bull market

[15-Jun-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD goes down in BTC as BTC goes down, but it goes up in BTC as BTC goes up. If you are in a hurry, better to buy some really marketing oriented coin that makes up fictions to pump its price up, even in a bear market

[15-Jun-18 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are patient, then buying when KMD is at a low price is locking in good gains in the future

not sure  KMD will ever get the crazy volumes of 10%+ marketcap per day. that is just washtrading. nothing trades that much per day and if it does, it is just artificial volumes. 1% of marketcap per day is a decent organic volume
