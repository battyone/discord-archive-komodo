[telegram] <CrisnKelly> Nice explanation Regnar - makes perfect sense. The reason I feel we want a fiat gateway is because we want perceived stability. If we could develop a stable coin that could be paired via an exchange to local market crypto this could be a winner. Not sure if anyone is doing this. Country coins is perhaps the answer if they are decentralised which we know they won‚Äôt be!! üò´
