[05-Jun-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if we didnt move it, 90%+ says it is safe, but best to move it anyway if you are an agama user

[telegram] <mozsi> How is this possible (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> if your address was vulnerable, we moved it to safety)

[05-Jun-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
vulnerability from upstream made it vulnerable

[telegram] <mozsi> How do you move someone elses funds?

[05-Jun-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
we could have just left it there for the attacker to take the funds at anytime, but decided it is better for all if we invoked the vuln and moved the funds to a safety address

if this address was compromised, all coins in that address are at risk

[05-Jun-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
we only swept KMD and BTC

[05-Jun-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763

move the other coins!

[05-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if the KMD moved that means the address is at risk

[05-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810

sending to it is fine

[05-Jun-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it only if the seed was input into the vulnerable agama

[05-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> Ok, I checked the balance last year and therefore it was input, so I should probably move
