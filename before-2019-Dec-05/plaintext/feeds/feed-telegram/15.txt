[telegram] <Acura360> Because you have only used the native mode.
You can login in with native, then send the complete Amount to yourself - after that, login with Lite Mode (re @MeiMeiU: No. I always enter this seed to wallet and I could see my coins before updating the wallet.)

[16-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> It is advised to claim reward at least once a month.

[16-Jun-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I think at a certain block height it's going to change form yearly to monthly anyway, so might as well start claiming monthly now.

[16-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
