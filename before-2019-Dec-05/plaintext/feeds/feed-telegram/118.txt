[telegram] <PTYTrader> It will most likely not be open source and we will charge ZILLA to be added to the wallet. I am waiting to have the alpha version ready before I make any decisions on the revenue model for the wallet

[26-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> However, it will include Komodo and all the assets that we currently have :)

[26-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Aug-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jmilks> Yes, decentralization can have many meanings though and is a rather vague term. For example developer wise Btc is decentralized, mining wise some people may argue Btc is centralized. I‚Äôm just curious as to what the criteria is that separates a dico from an ico. Generally don‚Äôt understand (not trying to pick an argument).

[26-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It's important to realize that BarterDEX is still a beta, and the Market Maker engine it's built on is still being tuned, as well as the GUI that will be the finalized version is likely to be different than it's current state, especially with the Ideas By Nature rebranding. Also being built on BarterDEX is HyperDEX which is only in Alpha. So low volume currently isn't really a problem, especially in a bear market. There is a lot of work being done to make it much more user friendly and speed up swap times, create liquidity providers, etc to help facilitate more volume. It's still in Beta though. Have you checked out HyperDEX yet? (re @TomKron: why barterdex has only 30 bucks trading volume)

[27-Aug-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I agree there are definitely too few decimals there for trading, if that is how they are doing it for KMD. It will be best for many users to contact their support directly (power in numbers) and request the change. They are potentially limited by their trading instruments, but I'm not sure on that. 
 Also Komodo doesn't really pay for exchange listings or fees btw. (re @Long: With that number of decimals, no trading, please negotiate with them, we paid fee not for no volume)

[27-Aug-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It's also why HitBTC price is excluded from CMC

[27-Aug-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But for example of why they do this we can look at Kraken who said "Reducing the price precision will help reduce extraneous activity in the order books as traders continually jump in front of each other by a very small fraction, resulting in a higher volume of canceled (unfilled) orders. We have received many requests from clients for this reduction and it will help reduce load on the trade engine with more efficient order books." Not sure what HitBTCs reason is. 
But if you would like changes, you should definitely contact them directly, it means more coming from their actual customers. (re @Long: With that number of decimals, no trading, please negotiate with them, we paid fee not for no volume)
