[telegram] <Wil> Me too! üòÑ (re @Bushybro: Good luck, I had my KMD on a ledger and when I saw how complicated it was I just moved it to agama....üòÖ)

[telegram] <Dolladollaiv> But if im putting my ledger address in for the bot chainzilla airdrops in discord will they show up when i eventually  export to agama?

[11-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You can also use ledger with Agama on lite mode (re @Dolladollaiv: Thank you. I have been trying to export from my ledger to my agama on my laptop thats running windows 7. Have had some problems syncing. Waiting for the blockchain to load to try again.)

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> KuCoin Listing Voting Competition
How To Vote:
1.  If you haven‚Äôt done so, make sure you sign-up on KuCoin. You will need your KuCoin account email address in order to vote.
2.  Our bot will send you a link to vote once it goes live on July 12th 18.00 UTC+8. All you have to do is start a conversation with it and it will do the rest.
3.   Fill the fields our bot sends you, you will be asked the following:
a.  What is Your KuCoin Account Email Address:
b.   Project Name You Want To Get Listed (spell the name in full, DON'T USE THE TICKER):
c.  What Is Special About This Project, Why Should It Be Listed On The Exchange:
NOTE: Every hour our bot will automatically update the top 50 projects in the public channel so everyone can see who is winning. 
Competition Rules:
We have a dedicated group of admins and bots to monitor and go through all the collected data. Do not cheat and make sure you follow the rules carefully if you want your vote to count.
1.  Do not vote for the same project twice. You can vote for multiple projects but do not repeat the same project, our voting system wont allow that.
2.  Make sure you spell the name of the project correctly. Our bots don't count your vote if you misspell the name.
3.  Don‚Äôt spam, remain polite and listen to the admins in the group. Offenders will be banned and votes revoked.
Who will win?
The project who gets the most votes, goes without saying, KuCoin will carry a quality check to ensure the project is legitimate before listing in order to protect investors' interests. 
The Prize:
The winner will get a free listing on KuCoin as well as a 30,000 USD advertisement package! On top of that, we are also committing 5 BTC value purchased in your tokens to be distributed via KuCoin to the users that voted for the winning project!

[12-Jul-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
