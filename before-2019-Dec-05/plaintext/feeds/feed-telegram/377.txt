[telegram] <virous77> True (re @Taner: patient is the very importantce guyss, dont sell your kmd in this level or you will be regret very soon.)

[28-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> If you hold your kmd you can claim rewards when ever you want. But if you let binance hold your kmd, it's not your kmd and binance is not claiming this for you. Best to withdraw and claim at least once each month to get rewards (5.1% yearly), it stops generating if not claimed monthly. Claiming is optimally done 1-3 times each month, there's not much difference (re @lexars: Hi, if i hold my kmd on binance,in the next month i receive rewards?)

[30-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Some interesting posts from JL777 about the impact to Komodo (and KMD) from his new discovery today:
"getting notarized SPV security at API wallet speeds
basically the best of both worlds
both speed and security can be achieved. essentially nSPV node would be very very close security model as a full node would be"
"you tell me. it applies only to komodo based chains that are dPoW notarized
it wont work with non-dPoW chains"
"yes, 1000 chains wanting dPoW is not so crazy and if each buys 10k KMD so they cover annual notarization costs via the rewards...
it is a big if, but at least in the realm of possible, if we can get a lot of ecosystem projects"

[telegram] <MIC7777> Hello. Something has been bugging me about ETH and Matic vs KMD. KMD does it's own sidechains via dPoW correct? So what the heck is the point of making a coin to scale ETH?
I just dont see what the point of matic is. Admins familiar ?

[30-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MIC7777> Sounds inefficient. And hey "let make a coin to solve another coins scaling issue".
I must be missing something that makes matic special.
