[telegram] <Regnar> Alot of times when you restore seeds in mobile wallets your phone's keyboard auto corrects the first word's letter to a capital, thinking you're typing a sentence. That's usually why the seeds "dont work" because its technically different, so just be mindful of that (re @BrokenBank: Think I'll just keep funds on the agama desktop wallet.)

[telegram] <PTYX11> If the keys are generated in Chameleon or Agama we will add a visual selection instead of having the user type it out. It should minimize user errors.

[31-May-19 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> üëç also a good idea security wise to not type out the full seed. Keyboards save word patterns, so if someone steals your phone they can try some words and see if there's a trend of seed words, or word recommendations that don't make sense lol (re @PTYX11: If the keys are generated in Chameleon or Agama we will add a visual selection instead of having the user type it out.

[telegram] <BrokenBank> So much to learn about this project. To be honest I've only recently noticed it.
I've grabbed 500 KMD and will just hold onto them and forget them. Keep them staking away and hopefully in a couple of years it's paid off as I can see so many projects wanting to build on KMD.
One question though. It's POS, but is it almost a hybrid POW/POS based on the fact that it's secured on top of the Bitcoin network hash rate??

[31-May-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It is not PoS (re @BrokenBank: So much to learn about this project. To be honest I've only recently noticed it.

[31-May-19 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> The 5%

[31-May-19 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> KMD is dPoW, its PoW with notarizations to protect the hashrate. The rewards you can accrue are not staking rewards.

[31-May-19 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Ahhh ok

[telegram] <BrokenBank> I have a lot of reading to do

[31-May-19 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Theres a feature called nTimelock. Basically a transaction that sets the time lock will start accruing KMD from an hour after the transaction up to 1 month, and then it stops accruing unless you claim the rewards and set the timelock again by claiming, or sending a transaction to yourself.
