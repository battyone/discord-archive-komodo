[telegram] <sreinhardt> Question about native Agama... Was running Agama Native mode. I downloaded Verus version and selected Native and it picked up right where Komodo version left off. I simply created a new address and sent all my KMD to it, all inside the Verus version. Is that good enough? Lots of talk of lite mode users making new seeds and such but the Native mode doesn't require that. Seemed a little too easy but honestly I'm not sure of the nature of how my old address was actually compromised so hard to tell for sure if this fixed it.

[06-Jun-19 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kapscedric> i found the same story in 2017 with ethereum Around 12:00 PST, an unknown attacker exploited a critical flaw in the Parity multi-signature wallet on the Ethereum network, draining three massive wallets of over $31,000,000 worth of Ether in a matter of minutes. Given a couple more hours, the hacker could‚Äôve made off with over $180,000,000 from vulnerable wallets.
But someone stopped them.
Having sounded the alarm bells, a group of benevolent white-hat hackers from the Ethereum community rapidly organized. They analyzed the attack and realized that there was no way to reverse the thefts, yet many more wallets were vulnerable. Time was of the essence, so they saw only one available option: hack the remaining wallets before the attacker did.
By exploiting the same vulnerability, the white-hats hacked all of the remaining at-risk wallets and drained their accounts, effectively preventing the attacker from reaching any of the remaining $150,000,000.
Yes, you read that right.
To prevent the hacker from robbing any more banks, the white-hats wrote software to rob all of the remaining banks in the world. Once the money was safely stolen, they began the process of returning the funds to their respective account holders. The people who had their money saved by this heroic feat are now in the process of retrieving their funds.
It‚Äôs an extraordinary story, and it has significant implications for the world of cryptocurrencies.
It‚Äôs important to understand that this exploit was not a vulnerability in Ethereum or in Parity itself. Rather, it was a vulnerability in the default smart contract code that the Parity client gives the user for deploying multi-signature wallets.
This is all pretty complicated, so to make the details of this clear for everyone, this post
