[telegram] <Crassuss> What to do if you have them on Ledger nano s? (re @Seko: Please don't let the word "HardFork" irritate you. It is not a fork from which two coins spring.  It's just an update. All you have to do is update Agama. More information will follow in the next days.
The Exchanges all get the daemon and do the same, they update their wallets.
So chill and keep cool!)

[02-Dec-18 01:24 PM] SHossain#0007
Ledger will update their backend daemon as well like any other service providers. So, should be ok.
