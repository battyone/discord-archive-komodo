Nice preaching dude... (re @AsadKhan1953: Guys I am sorry for all of you including me. We are now part of crypto demise. We lose our money our trust our belief and our hope. But, we have to step back to realize the fucking beauty of an elephant. This crypto was a lesson for us that there is no easy money. We also learn that carporate world is more cruel then we can imagine. All business whales sell their souls to devil and they don't care about common people. What matter for them is to make money by any means. Thier false promises always have some ulterior motives to make more money. BTC is the future money, BTC is gold 2.0, BTC is the real money and many other shilling words. These whales used BTC to attract millenials, common people and others, and we fall for it. But life doesnot end here.  Now is the time to pick yourself up, shake off the dust and move on. Work double hard in real world and real work and recover your losses. Success come for those who learn from their mistakes and move on. Good luck)

[telegram] <FilippoE> More or less 5M kmd per year is distributed

[11-Sep-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FilippoE> But not all coin are in holding to Agama wallet

[11-Sep-18 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FilippoE> So, not 100% of tot supply is allowed to claim the rewards

[11-Sep-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FilippoE> This calculation takes 100% of coin, but In really we don't know which x% of kmd its hold in Agama

[telegram] <golovka4lena> Any news?

[11-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Ok let me clear up the misinfo above

[11-Sep-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> 1) unclaimed interest is not given to miners,  it just isn't generated. This will lower the expected final coin count at the end of the coin generation.  2)  200 million is not the max cap,  the cap is whatever amount of coins is generated by block 7777777,  we estimate it to be around 200 million but that's not a set number

[11-Sep-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FilippoE> Ah ok
