[09-Jun-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be an interesting data for someone to gather, i havent seen such an analysis yet

[09-Jun-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
a rough estimate showed only about half are claiming regularly

[09-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <GLCNI01> So it's not the case where unclaimed rewards distribute out to those who do claim?

[09-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zilh1> Those figures definitely show a negative inflation for regular claimers.

[09-Jun-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
unclaimed coins never come into existence, so it is hard to distribute them

[09-Jun-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and that would be crazy complex to do anyway

[09-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zilh1> Do claimed 'interest' coins have a vestige time?

[09-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zilh1> before they can be used to claim?

[09-Jun-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is if you track your coins as a percentage of overall, you will find that by claiming regularly, it will be increasing. if you dont, it is decreasing, so in that sense it is being redistributed from the passive to the more active. however, it is a very small effect overall

[09-Jun-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
one hour time

[09-Jun-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
after one hour any utxo above 10 KMD can claim

[09-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zilh1> cool

[09-Jun-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you do the math and compensate for txfee, it doesnt really change the APR that much no matter how often you claim, as long as it is monthly

[09-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zilh1> isn't claiming with zero fee?

[09-Jun-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0001 is needed

[09-Jun-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can get by with less, depends on how many utxo are combined

[09-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zilh1> ok.

[telegram] <Oliveds> Dear members,
Today is the day. 5 hours left and we will mass buy a coin. The team is totally ready. The strategy will be the same as last pump. Our team had contact with various news channels. Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin. 
üìçLink : https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAFJRX6TxswRoaNmUpg
The helpers got hundreds of DM's about if this is going to be a rank pump or not. Like we stated in the Discord. The rank system is close to being ready. This means, that this pump it will still be free-for-all. Like last time everyone will receive the coin signal at the same time!

[telegram] <efmartinez> I did it admin but until now no coin arrives in my new kmd coinomi addresd (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> now that the vast majority of addresses have been claimed, i can reveal the three step process that will be used for processing refunds.
1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.
what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.
if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done. 
Please dont expect any refund payments until june 15, maybe i can get it done sooner, but step 3 is a LOT of custom code that cannot have any errors)
