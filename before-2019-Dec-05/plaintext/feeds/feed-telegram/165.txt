[telegram] <Acura360> Want to be part of a small group of beta testers for the Agama Wallet refresh? Click this link to apply - https://ideasbynature.typeform.com/to/BNkvvQ
1. We'll ask you a few questions about wallets in general, the formats you prefer and problems/issues they currently have. It's not intended to be a survey about Agama directly but rather an opportunity for us to better understand your needs as a crypto wallet user.
2. At the end of the survey, we'll ask you if you'd like to be involved in live user tests, which can be done remotely, and, if so, ask you to leave us an email address.
3. The Komodo team will select a small group of people from among those who indicated a desire to participate. We will choose participants based on the effort put into the comments in Step 1. This is a great chance to have your feedback and opinions heard in the live user tests.

[telegram] <SURINDER> SURINDER KUMAR:
Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.
