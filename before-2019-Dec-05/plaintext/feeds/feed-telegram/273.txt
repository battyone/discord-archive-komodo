[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> I've seen talks of they being insolvent... If he can take his coins out of there converting to another coin with withdrawals enabled, it could be a good idea... Just my 2 cents! (re @ProofofResearch: He's looking to get it off because he's a long time hodler. Do you guys know what's going on w Coinbene since $KMD is on there?)

[13-Apr-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> I've seen ppl claiming this kind of behaviour can make a project/coin be seen as a security in some jurisdictions... (re @TheoHx: ive heard of other crypto groups doing buy backs when the price is low and selling hire as a source of volume and revenue stimulation)

Presenting a nice buy opportunity. Plenty of room to run. RSI reset. Should provide good r/r but might get better price on next pull back.
