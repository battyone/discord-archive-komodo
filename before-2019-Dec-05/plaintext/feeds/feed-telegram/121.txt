[telegram] <Regnar> Yes that seed is yours forever, just make sure you write it down offline as well so you don't lose it. (re @Coneyboy: hey I have created my agama wallet and chose lite mode with and a wallet seed generated by the wallet. I have checked a few days in a row and my small amount of kmd is there. I now wish to send all my remaining kmd out of my ledger to my agama wallet. provided I keep that 24 word phrase secret that wallet is mine forever yes??)

[telegram] <Hermes08> With that 24 word seed you should always be able to view your balance using Agama, as long as you keep it safe you will be ok.

1. You can use a different mnemonic within the coinomi app? -short answer is yes!
2. Can you use a mnemonic that originated from a different wallet alongside the tutorial above? - depends on a few things but you should be able to. (re @matanajwa: can you use memonic from a wallet other than coinomi admin?)

[29-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> To add to my answer of 2. 
- The derivation path that the original wallet uses for some coins may be a different format to what coinomi uses. In this case you can head over to the official support channel for some assistance (re @Brenny431: I don't understand your question completely. Are you asking if
