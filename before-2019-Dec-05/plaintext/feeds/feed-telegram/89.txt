[05-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> No, Komodo is only tied to Bitcoin for their hash power. their scaling solutions do not affect Komodo notarization process so long as they have the greatest hash power we will use them. This is basically because the ability to reverse blocks and change data on Bitcoin is so expensive and difficult it makes logical sense to use it for notarization. If another project comes along and eventually has greater hash power than Bitcoin, we can easily begin notarizations on that chain instead. (re @james: If komudo is tied to bitcoin network for security reasons,  would the scalability of bitcoin affect komodo?)

[05-Aug-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But there are other criteria that must be met too, obviously if a centralized ledger, or one that has a level of authority to freeze, or make changes has greater hash than bitcoin, we won't switch to that as it's counter Komodo's decentralized beliefs and wouldn't make sense to put our notarizations in the hands of a centralized authority.

[telegram] <yorklab> It’s really a matter of waiting it out. There’s a lot of crap coins out there, and many will be gone in time, but Komodo will still be around.

[05-Aug-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Agreed, there's a lot of fancy new tech ideas out there which is great because we all want innovation, but the reality is when a vulnerability is found, or they realize it may not work as well as expected, or as well as other tried and true solutions, changes will be made (re @yorklab: Also, many platforms are failing to deliver on their promises. The enthusiasm will begin to fade, then they will move on to other platforms that are delivering.)

[05-Aug-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Agreed. Though there is different types of exposure, do we want exposure to individual investors? potential projects launching dICOs? projects from other chains migrating over? selling dPoW security services? getting 3rd parties to build on our DEX engine? Fiat-to-crypto conversions? new mobile wallets? bring in more developers and dApps? Venture Capital money? Non-Blockchain businesses to build blockchains? 
There's a ton of potential avenues for growth and usage. The marketing team is working on the strategy and best avenues to approach in order for mass adoption in all of these categories, but it is very difficult. If you appear to appeal to too many, it can dilute the message and content. If you cater to a specific group you can miss out on better opportunities. (re @Rastapipop: I agree
