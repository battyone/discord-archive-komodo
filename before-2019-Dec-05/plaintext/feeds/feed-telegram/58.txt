[telegram] <N21_0> Project placed 54th with 461 votes 
there is a lot of Bot's (re @BearTheTrader: guys i think my vote for komodo on kucoin did not go through)

[15-Jul-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giffordde2000> I fully support the Komodo team.
I may not do anything other than HODL and that has been from the very beginning.
I am amazed at the negativity the team  endures while incubating the best project in the Cryptoverse. 
If you cannot support the project by holding, get involved and if you have something to say at least be constructive about it.  We all benefit from healthy discussions thus supporting this project. What are you doing here? 
Unless you are just someone who spews negativity and FUD. 
I often wonder if this vitriol behavior is orchestrated. 
Komodo Team your amazing and I applaud all of you! 
Brilliance does not happen overnight it is created.

[telegram] <pdtm> But how much chainzilla and what will be the Value? (re @yorklab: Just to be clear; Chainzillia is having an airdrop for anyone holding at least 500kmd in their own (Agama) wallet)

[15-Jul-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> 1 Chainzilla around 45 cent i think

[15-Jul-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pdtm> And there will be 500 of Chainzilla?

[15-Jul-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> 500 kmd= ca 4,8Zilla

[15-Jul-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Supppppppppp> What is ratio for 500kmd to zilla. I don‚Äôt get ca 4,8... does that mean 4.8??

[15-Jul-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Yes, that is the estimate for now. 500kmd = about 4.8 Zilla

[15-Jul-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Supppppppppp> Okay thanks

[15-Jul-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> But you must own the keys to your wallet. So I suggest keeping in Agama wallet.

[15-Jul-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> If you keep KMD on the exchange then it is likely you will not get Zilla.

[15-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> No. If you hold at least 500 kmd you should receive Zilla.

[15-Jul-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hui25> ok.thanks (re @yorklab: No. If you hold at least 500 kmd you should receive Zilla.)

If you have a multi-million $ crypto project that is mutable for the cost of a cup of coffee every day for a week, you might want to add some way to protect your chain. It may cost a little now but it's a lot harder to get back your reputation after it's lost.

[15-Jul-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Last I heard later this month. But not sure if there is an official date.

[15-Jul-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <traider199> Hi, the site write: stop receiving rewards if you have not used the Komodo network for one month (coins have not moved in one month)
if I deposite up the address once a week, but I will not withdrawal , does it mean that the awards will stop in a month?

[15-Jul-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You have to "claim" at least once a month.

[15-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> When you claim,  you're just sending the entire amount to yourself.

[15-Jul-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <traider199> Once a month or more often I press a claim and all ok? do not send funds to another address?

[15-Jul-18 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Yes, that's fine.

[telegram] <Stuart> Can you only export private keys in native mode ?

[16-Jul-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Stuart> Or in lite mode I just enable advanced features?

[16-Jul-18 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Your seed is your key. But you can go into menu, then settings then "Export Keys".

[16-Jul-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You have several options to create a WIF from your seed/passphrase.

[16-Jul-18 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Oh, sorry, you asked about Native, I was thinking LIte. Yes you said it correctly. you can export your key.

[16-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Stuart> So if I simply put my passphrase and receive address from my nano s in the bip39 section under settings tab I will be able to get my WIF to then claim interest ?

[16-Jul-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Try to follow this:

[16-Jul-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Stuart> That wallets a bit old do I still need to go into app config in the wallet settings to enable experimental functions ?

[16-Jul-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> yes, then save app config then shut down wallet, then relaunch. From there I don't want to direct you any more because I have never owned a ledger and don't want to steer you wrong. Others here have gone thorugh the process and may be able to guide you through.

[16-Jul-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> After you get the WIF keys of the address that have your funds you should be able to claim the reward (re @Stuart: I‚Äôm trying on a second nano with shit all kmd on there I will keep trying lol)
