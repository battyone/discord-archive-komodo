[telegram] <Earl> OMG, check this cryptotrader... over the past 5 months he made approx 400 % profit every month with his trades, total of 1800%. He has many followers that copy his trades, which makes me want to start copying his trades too. What do you guys think?

[telegram] <Kaelyn> Hey! I do love this group so far and i do want to share something value with y'all! I found a group called ' @HouseofAcquisition '. Basically they do share paid insider info for free, and they made more as 200% profit in only 7 weeks - they do documentate all their trades in an online profitsheet!

[telegram] <Jamlite> It‚Äôs platforms like Komodo that will show crypto and the world what blockchain platforms are all about.  Eos and Cardano might never gain adoption or trust.

[25-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jamlite> Any thoughts on how Komodo will gain market share from Ethereum?

[25-Aug-18 03:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
By allowing people to create independent blockchains with assetchains so that people with erc20 tokens aren‚Äôt tied to ETH‚Äôs blockchain forever

[25-Aug-18 03:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
And by using CryptoConditions on Komodo for their smart contracts instead of ETH

[25-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Unlimited scaling plus this quote from Bitcoin Benny in link I provided above:

[telegram] <AISSAM> For those seeking financial freedom.
I offer you an upward project for a very strong digital currency, registered in Block Shin Dubai and supported by senior leaders of Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey and others.
Currency started at $ 0.5 to become the price of 1.63 now under the crisis known by the digital currency market, but if the market returned to the recovery can be seen currency flying on the surface of $ 100 and above.
Project Link:
https://jaag.network/r/rodq/safeinvest2

More explanations on your.
Each one is interested and registered to add to the official group Facebook, which includes the adult Ldrat and where the points are discussed and analysis of meetings and conferences ....
good luck
Leader Aissam.
