[telegram] <Acura360> https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/ (re @Raghav: I am getting an error ok 2.39 and 2.40 is not ready. I am worried if my funds are still there or not)

[26-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> It is confusing, but that‚Äôs why HyperDex was developed. Can kinda think of it as BarterDex 2.0 (re @MrRollie: how can i then know what i should pay for it?)

[26-Jun-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> But beyond that, BarterDex needs more people providing liquidity to make it a smooth ride. More adoption, better end user experience.

[26-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> No coverage is inexcusable, and technologically id also argue it‚Äôs the best. But for the end user it‚Äôs still a little difficult. Other DEX are only decentralized to various levels,  none to the extent of bdex. So, that gives them the advantage, like a pure CEX, of having much more control (key word) over the user experience. (re @JUJU333: no KMD coverage, yet we're the best when it comes to a DEX)

[26-Jun-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JUJU333> I agree (re @J: No coverage is inexcusable, and technologically id also argue it‚Äôs the best. But for the end user it‚Äôs still a little difficult.
