[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Chuangshi Capital made something with kmd, but what they made, I did not understand :D

[11-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> This article has been published by many Chinese media outlets. Chuangshi Capital is a Chinese blockchain investor firm. They released this news saying they invest/ed "millions of RMB" into KMD (undisclosed amount). We do not have any more information about it, and they invested on the open market as it looks like (explains the price pump). We don't have an official relationship with Chuangshi, but we are obviously happy to see traction in China!

[telegram] <Regnar> The rewards are not part of consensus or mining

[11-Nov-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Proof of stake requires you to have a wallet open and "staking". Komodo does not do this, KMD is equihash PoW. The rewards are different, they have no affect on consensus or mining.

[11-Nov-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Best not to try and fit Rewards into a bucket like PoS. Yes they both result in you having more coins, but they are fundamentally different in what they actually do to obtain them. This is why we actively correct people when they refer to it as staking. Even Binance makes this mistake. But it is NOT staking.

[11-Nov-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Caleb> Right, that’s why I am so confused. Lol I guess I’m a bit wary because coins have to come from somewhere and I have yet to understand where these rewards are coming from. I’d like to understand the sustainability of the APR before I invest too much time and energy into utilizing it. (re @Regnar: Best not to try and fit Rewards into a bucket like PoS.

[11-Nov-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> it's also very important that the user rewards _do not_ raise the total supply

[11-Nov-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> The rewards will also eventually stop when the total supply is reached.

[11-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Nov-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Caleb> Also, looks like the rewards stop at block 7,777,777

Komodore64, an announced gaming platform using $KMD, will have some problems now, as the CEO is seemingly arrested. 

And the 78$ million seems fake too. 

Weird, was in a podcast ones with him. Reminds me of what type of market this is.
