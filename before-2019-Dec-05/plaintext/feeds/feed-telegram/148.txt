mining difficulty has increased significantly as well

[29-Sep-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
as hashrate went to 30Msols, which is the third highest equihash coin as far as I know

[29-Sep-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810

for now PIRATE is for native mode only.

next year we expect lite mode to be available, but of course this 0.1KMD cannot be guaranteed to last

[29-Sep-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
also it is being offered by a community member

[29-Sep-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Jumblr makes coins fungible

[29-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> It does it by making a series of transactions that create a "Blackbox" where you cant decipher what is being mixed. You can only see what goes in and comes out. However, what comes out is all denominated in the same amounts and in timeframes that can be delayed. So it's difficult to trace once KMD is Jumblrd.
