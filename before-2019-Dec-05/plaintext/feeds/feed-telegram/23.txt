[telegram] <Regnar> Okay so in my normal fashion here I go. Bithumb has been hacked for supposedly +$30MM and has frozen all accounts from withdrawing. This is the perfect climate for Decentralized Exchanges like HyperDEX and BarterDEX (and honestly, a lot of others too) to step in and push marketing. So here is my attempt to bring some attention to Komodo in this midst of these hacks. 
Like this tweet, retweet it, post all over Bithumbs page about Komodo, Decentralized Exchanges, owning private keys, HyperDEX, BarterDEX etc. Use hashtags, and tag Komodo and other crypto minded pages you like or follow. bring eyes to Bithumb and see this hack and let those eyes see DEXs and Komodo and how they are the safer option. Make sure you like EVERY post you see on those pages about Komodo. We ALL know we need more marketing, and Decentralization only works when there is an active community, well this is community led marketing and it ONLY works if we have numbers behind it. 
do your part, step up, help spread the word.

@BithumbOfficial Nothing like a +$30MM hack of a centralized exchange and frozen funds to remind you that if you don't own the private key...you don't own those coins. #DEX @KomodoPlatform @HyperDEXApp #BTC #KMD @TheSuperSenda @ThoreauInfosec #ifyoudonthavetheprivatekeysyo...

@Socal_crypto They have the volume and that's what coins want. But total population liquidity happens when every wallet can trade with every other wallet, on any chain, no middlemen. #atomicswap powered DEXs exist like @HyperDEXApp built on @KomodoPlatform but hardest part...

Come to discord and ask in #komodo-team if marketing related. Or to the devs in #ask-jl777  link: https://discord.gg/vVj7Ftf

[21-Jun-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sagarmatha> Good idea. Better solution is use kmd as maincoin so kmd increase in value. ;) Person A swap ark to kmd and kmd to OMG. Other do the same. In your process its very difficult to get agreements as A,B,C has also a certain immagination of the ratio example -> Person A wants 3 OMG for 2 ARK, Person B wants 14 NEO for 1 OMG, Person C wants 1 ARK for x NEO
Now x has to be 21 otherwise the relations dont fit together. Then we could start the swaps. 
Lets continue example. Just B gets all it wanted. 
It gets too complex in my opinion. Better its using a main currency temporarly when liquidity is not given at the moment. (re @Kaichichow: Would there be a way to make liquidity and matching easier for our dex? Say person A wants to swap from ARK to OMG. 
Instead of just putting up an order to sell ark for omg, would the system be able to bring in person B?
So if person A is wanting to swap ARK to OMG, and no current orders available. 
Person B wants to go from OMG to NEO
Person C wants NEO for ARK. 
Would a system be able to be implemented where person A B and C are automatically matched and swapped? Seeing as fees are low enough for multiple trades to reach the endgoal outcome?)

[telegram] <eMort667> If I hold 20 kmd for 1 year then I‚Äôll earn approximately 1 kmd in rewards. What about if I convert the 20 kmd to DEX then hold for 1 year, approximately how much KMD will earn? I‚Äôm also curious what‚Äôs the current rate for KMD/DEX?

[21-Jun-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> How do you earn from DEX? I thought you only earn 5% by just holding in the agama wallet.

dex price https://dexstats.info/gui/index.php?base=DEX&rel=KMD

[21-Jun-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CHMEX> At the moment you get a garanteed 5% if you hold KMD. DEX is an asset which pays dividends which are 50% of the DEX fee (0.15%) of a barterdex trade there are 1mio DEX.
In the long run DEX might pay a higer yield than the 5% you currenlty get on KMD also stops having the reward in about 13 years.
