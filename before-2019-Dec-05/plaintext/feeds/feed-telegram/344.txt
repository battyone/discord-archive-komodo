[telegram] <Dimension 9> Many thanks...appreciate the help...so after all that...all I needed to do was update the wallet...I‚Äôve been filling in forms to get it back from the account they‚Äôve put all the funds in, creating new wallets etc... (re @Sungonightly: Yes i think so)

we cant

[07-Jun-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
we only could save the funds using the data the hacker had, so if we didnt sweep it already, we dont have the ability

[07-Jun-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Well, my 2 cents... All info released by the team about what they've done and how to recover the funds are pretty clear!
They kicked some ass outsmarting the attackers and saved millions of USD worth in KMD and BTC...
If those stupid jerks bashing the solution can't read this and understand it, I guess no amount of "enlightening" will make them understand...
Sadly, because otherwise I'd agree with you... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ (re @Keytothegate: Regarding the possible bad and / or misinformed rumors or "news" in social media about the whole hack case: After everything that the team and community has done we owe it to Komodo to correct these and comment on wordt fudders.

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Do you know your (old) address? If so, just look it up in the block explorer and you should find the TXID there (re @Dimension 9: I have no access to this in my Agama wallet...there is no transactions shown...its balck with a message saying "Connection error etc" I can see any transaction out of the wallet!)

[07-Jun-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
any help about fixing the social media trolling is much appreciated. feel free to start posts about how it saved you from the hacker and the alternative of just doing nothing would have been a horrible choice, the one the trolls are suggesting

Anyone who still has the Komodo version of agama installed (0.3.6/0.3.5/0.3.4/mobile) please uninstall them 
you don't need it, just having a backup of old seed is enough for any future use

[07-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> Can someone clarify, I moved over my kmd to ledger about a year ago but so have some other kmd asset tokens in my agama which I have logged in or opened since.
From my understanding the seeds are only sent during the login process. If I haven't logged in are they safe?

[07-Jun-19 07:20 PM] gcharang#6833
mo7881
did you use the same ledger seed in agama to access the assetchains?

[07-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> I never used my ledger seeds. I used the luke Childs app to claim

[07-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Yeah I think reasonable people will listen. I explained the situation and how insanely good the actions taken were by the team and community couple of hours ago in chico crypto tg-channel to admin who was calling komodo scum.

[07-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Only people who cannot tell the difference between a car and a road or wallet and blockchain won't understand when you give them facts. And it was for the benefit of all, kmd investors, ecosystem and whole crypto (because also btc's were rescued. It was good in general. And funny fact no one is yelling btc is scam because of wallet hack)

[07-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jun-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> I can see that there might be some value in giving out some statements and maybe interviews regarding the incident.

[07-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> It is an opportunity to tell the facts and let em decide. I believe most would like the actions taken and the result. And on top of that it's an opportunity to tell what is coming from Komodo. Turning possible bad publicity in to good.

[telegram] <DigitalWealthCreator> The danger here is in creating a new wallet with a new address so that my coins do not appear.  Where do I go in the settings section and what do I do there? I have settings open right now. Thanks. (re @Werxadler: Check in settings, it's not a big deal)

as long as you have the seed(24 words), you can't lose access even if you forgot pin or anything like that
where did you create the seed phrase if not in the Verus Agama wallet?

[telegram] <DigitalWealthCreator> I created the seed phrase in the old Agama wallet and the seed phrase I have, but using the seed phrase will not recreate the wallet like I had it before with the name of the wallet and the PIN to open it up. I have all of that but want to recreate it in this new version of the AGAMA wallet. Thanks. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <gcharang> DigitalWealthCreator

[telegram] <Werxadler> Sorry i can't tell because i am not at my PC anymore, but as long you have saved your seed you will have access anyway (re @DigitalWealthCreator: The danger here is in creating a new wallet with a new address so that my coins do not appear.

you must move those funds from that seed to a new seed created using the Verus agama or else you might lose them

1) Download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview 
2) First, create a new wallet (new seed)
3) Note down the address 
4) Logout then Login at least two times to verify that the seed is giving you the same address everytime
5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode. Then send all the funds to the new KMD address created previously
6) If you face "electrum error", "connection error" or "get_balance error", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/
7) Uninstall the old version of agama and don't run it again. But please keep a backup of your old(compromised) seed, wif, privkey or anyother way you used to Access your old wallet. See the following article to backup your old access method: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024424-how-to-secure-your-wallet-seed-private-keys-wallet-dat-file

[telegram] <Werxadler> Sorry, i don't understand, if you have New adress and New seed you can install passwort and walletname under settings (re @DigitalWealthCreator: See above.)

[telegram] <DigitalWealthCreator> I have old address and old seed. I want to recreate the wallet like I had it before. But the instructions given above by admin are way too complicated to do on one computer I think. (re @Werxadler: Sorry, i don't understand, if you have New adress and New seed you can install passwort and walletname under settings)
