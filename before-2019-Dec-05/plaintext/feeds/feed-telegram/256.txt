[telegram] <David> When you make the change, you explain what happened. Utility has nothing to do with updating the supply. (re @Regnar: That's not how value is derived, by any economic school of thought. First of all, you're confusing value with PRICE, in a ceteris paribus economic model an increase in supply with constant demand would lower price, but markets price in expected growth of supply, which is WHY predictable inflation of a currency is important, even Bitcoin supply is inflating. 
Secondly, bring your statement which you say isn't hard to understand, to its logical conclusion. IF value increases when Supply goes down, then any coin would be most VALUABLE as supply approaches zero. But value isn't derived this way, because a currency is considered valuable because of other attributes (fungibility, divisibility, store of value, MoE, network effect etc) a single coin (or really small amount of coins) isnt good at pretty much any of this (unless it is hugely divisible, then you are just changing the scale of the supply anyway))

[20-Mar-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> Also should know after you claim it wont accrue for another hour. So depending how frequently you claim will affect that. If you claim daily, you lose out on 365 hours of accruing, or 15 days, roughly 4% of the entire year. How frequently are you claiming? (re @CryptomanXX: Yes I know)

[20-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> It's correct! This sums up to 5.1% per year (re @TonyStarkBR: It's actually 0,415% per month)

[20-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptomanXX> But that is not 5.1% yearly (re @CryptomanXX: That‚Äôs what I think it is)

[20-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Yes, it is! See the picture! (re @TonyStarkBR: )

[20-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> 41,5 KMD, approx (re @CryptomanXX: So from 10,000 how much should you have a month)

[20-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> I've rounded that number a little bit (re @TonyStarkBR: IF it's 0.415% per month, THEN, it's 5.1% per year)

[20-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptomanXX> Not 42,5? (re @TonyStarkBR: 41,5 KMD, approx)

[20-Mar-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> That would be 5.22% per year (re @CryptomanXX: Not 42,5?)

[20-Mar-19 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptomanXX> 510 yearly /12 = 42.5

[20-Mar-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <CryptomanXX> According to Komodo calculations

[20-Mar-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> 5.1% yearly means 0.415% monthly (re @CryptomanXX: That means it‚Äôs not 5.1% yearly)

[20-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> It's 41,5 in the first month! In the second month you have 10041.5 NOT 10K, you apply the percentage to 10041.5 (re @CryptomanXX: So from 10,000 how much should you have a month)

[20-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Obviously, of we have 5.1% per year, it should give 510 KMD approx per year (re @CryptomanXX: )

[20-Mar-19 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Yes and no. The team is still working out the best mechanism to distribute some of the remaining supply. I'm studying a little bit more about what utrum did in regards to their "hodl" feature which is similar to staking which takes place in their wallet. Ideally, users would be rewarded for holding ChainZilla in our applications. However, due to the ICO results our priorities shifted from community building to sales. So this will be put on hold until I feel Chameleon is ready. (re @Cdude: Will more chainzilla be airdropped for KMD holders?)

[telegram] <Cdude> Ah okay either way sounds good (re @PTYX11: Yes and no. The team is still working out the best mechanism to distribute some of the remaining supply.
