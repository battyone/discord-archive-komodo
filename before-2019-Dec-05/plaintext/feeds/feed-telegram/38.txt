[telegram] <bitcoinfiat> I use 2.40 ... Still not working (re @Hermes08: Hi there please update to our latest release 2.40 here https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/)

[26-Jun-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> I read the electrum servers are down for an upgrade

[telegram] <elikxx> Hello. Whom can i speak regarding dICO launching on komodo?

[26-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I had that problem too. I know how to change it though (re @Starfungus: i can't change the socket timeout)

[26-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Starfungus> how's that?

[26-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> To KMD admins - something changed on the server side that changed kmd electrum behavior. I was using 2.38 just fine, but then it just started getting this timeout error. I updated to 2.39, no improvement

[26-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Like Mariano said, the GUI locks the timeout parameter, so people can‚Äôt even follow the guide to fix it.

[26-Jun-18 02:40 PM] gcharang#6833
@PTYX can help with your dICO

[26-Jun-18 02:41 PM] gcharang#6833
Agama spv servers have some issues right now. Please wait till an announcement of a fix is made.

[26-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Mariano, to answer your question, you need to find the configuration file in question and edit it directly. Shut down Agama before you edit it

[26-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> If you're using SPV please wait until we release the latest wallet

[26-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Some updates took place that is affecting the old wallets using SPV

[26-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Nothing to worry it's just a Gui issue

[telegram] <dickygustia> how enable etomic ? i want add coin  SANC

[26-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I changed my timeout to 20000 by directly editing my config file. That seemed to work.

[26-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Starfungus> fk it ... i will just wait until the next update...

[26-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Starfungus> it should be in the next period i'm sure :)

[26-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Starfungus> still trusting the Komodo Team!

[26-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Please write us at contact@chainzilla.io and I'll schedule an initial call so we can get more details (re @elikxx: Hello. Whom can i speak regarding dICO launching on komodo?)

[26-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Cool, Mariano. It isn‚Äôt difficult if you wanna try.

[26-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Yes the update is actually available but not public. So it will be available soon

[26-Jun-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Of course, Komodo team is highly competent.

[telegram] <J> Is LEND erc-20 available for trade/tested on BarterDex yet?

[26-Jun-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> I'm not sure if Lend is available but we recently implemented an update that allows for more coins to be added to bdex. Before we had a 255 limit. So I will ask

[26-Jun-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> On the coin addition tab type etomic and it will come up (re @dickygustia: admin help me)

[26-Jun-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I just started using Lend, it‚Äôs actually a working dAPP, so would be a great base on BarterDex. Thanks @PTYTrader

[26-Jun-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I like all of these crypto loan tokens. We already have Salt and Air, lend will be a great addition.

[26-Jun-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Definitely, if it can be added and people are trading it I don't see why not
