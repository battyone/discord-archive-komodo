[telegram] <Alfianto> I don't have any filled orderüò≠

[31-Oct-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> The Komodo team is extremely grateful for the overwhelming response we've received for the AtomicDEX Beta stress test. Due to this huge amount of participation, we hit bottlenecks in our infrastructure much sooner than we had anticipated. This led to a high percentage of swaps not matching properly. As such, we're adjusting the requirements for entry into the prize pool. All you need to do is match one swap and you're eligible to win prizes. It is not a requirement for the swap to successfully complete- one matched swap (1/3) is enough to make into the prize pool. (re @cryptollll: Please send me this comment copy paste .. I dont understand.. I need Google translate üòÇ)

[31-Oct-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Alfianto> Wow.. (re @mangadul: )

[31-Oct-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sempreverde33> So good results and bad results are always a success?
Surely this test will helps devs to improve the system but I think that if they made a stress test today is because they expected a different result today...
On the whole day only 2 swap were finalized for me. (re @tese22: And we have results so the test was successfull)

[31-Oct-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Point of a stress test is to see what breaks under heavy load

[31-Oct-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Oct-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> still, quite inconsistent and random behavior

[31-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> Also, did you notice that while an order is still in the "matching" (0/3) state and you navigate back, and click on the orders tab, then you can't get to the order again by tapping it. Usually, as soon as state 1/3 has started, tapping the order leads you back to its details.

[31-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> That's also something I find inconstistent.

[31-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> some dev's should look into this.

[31-Oct-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
