[telegram] <Ming Êòé> Imaging one day people start using hard wallet like smart phone now. I mean hard wallet having network connection for storing, swapping and transferring only which less security vulnerable than smartphone.

[02-Aug-18 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think the thought process for hardware wallets is that you store funds there and then lock them away for long periods of time. You wouldn't want to carry it around everywhere for the risk of being mugged and forced at gun point to unlock your wallet (though there are duress pins for that) but still. (re @Ming Êòé: Imaging one day people start using hard wallet like smart phone now. I mean hard wallet having network connection for storing, swapping and transferring only which less security vulnerable than smartphone.)

[02-Aug-18 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> mobile phones can likely be good "hardware" to store on just like the current wallet apps, so long as the app is sufficiently encrypted and protected. but having your private keys on a mobile device with internet, wifi, bluetooth, cell signal, hot spot, etc is already worrisome enough. I only have "walking around money" on my phone wallets :D

in a bear market BTC is sold for fiat, less BTC available to be on the books for alts, but more needs to be sold due to lower price, which exaggerates the altcoin losses

I'm buying'
4 in the mornin', the windows tinted
I'm Buying'
Can't stop me
My Wife had a dream that the Komodo shot me to 120$$
Who got me?
Can't trust nobody, my best exchange robbed me
I'm 'bout it
Agama in working, no ring, I'm silent
No options No fees
Focus on this money 'cause I dropped out of my office
I'm buying'
Warrants got me goin' back to Hyperdex like @JL777
I'm buying'

[telegram] <rene27> no because i have common sense, this market cap going 100x would put komodo inside the top 10 of all crypto (re @Acura360: because he is a time traveller and know¬¥s the future)

[telegram] <Regnar> ...assuming the entire market doesn't move as well? $100/KMD would be roughly 11B market cap, that wouldn't even put it in the top 10 eight months ago.. (re @rene27: no because i have common sense, this market cap going 100x would put komodo inside the top 10 of all crypto)
