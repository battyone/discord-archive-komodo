[telegram] <Regnar> Blocks are every minute, confirmations are likely less. I assume you're talking about centralized Exchanges minimum confirmation amounts being high, so you think the coin is slow... it's not. Your coins are sitting in the exchanges wallet, look at the block explorer, the exchange just doesnt want to give you access yet.... not your keys, not your coins (re @Tuankrab: Transaction of this coin is to sloowww)

[13-Mar-19 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> the bots of the system have preference to make arbitration and thus the mortals do not have possibility to take advantage of it hahaha

[13-Mar-19 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loremipsumdolors> best for arbitrage is having the coin on both exchanges, no latency, no risk (re @David: how many have wanted to take advantage of the arbitration and are they eating the snot? hahaha)

[13-Mar-19 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> Entre intercambios, la solicitud de confirmaci√≥n es bastante amplia y me temo que es para evitar que podamos aprovechar el arbitraje.

[13-Mar-19 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> between exchanges the request for confirmations is quite broad and I am afraid that is to avoid that we can take advantage of arbitration

[telegram] <first_world_peace> Can't get rewards from holding kmd on exchange I believe :( (re @loremipsumdolors: best for arbitrage is having the coin on both exchanges, no latency, no risk)

[13-Mar-19 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loremipsumdolors> that's supposed to be to avoid 51% attacks, but more than 50 I also think is too much (re @David: between exchanges the request for confirmations is quite broad and I am afraid that is to avoid that we can take advantage of arbitration)

[13-Mar-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loremipsumdolors> true, but if you want to arbitrage the winners are the ones who have the coins first (re @first_world_peace: Can't get rewards from holding kmd on exchange I believe :()
