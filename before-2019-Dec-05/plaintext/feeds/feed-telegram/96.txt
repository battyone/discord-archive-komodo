[telegram] <Regnar> To run a node? No minimum required, but to earn 5.1% rewards on your balance, you need a minimum of 10 KMD in an address, the simplest way to do this is to store funds in Agama (even the lite mode) and press the claim interest button. (re @hifonz: minimum KMD required?)

[09-Aug-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> why would lack of interest in a bear market be concerning (re @Rubinho: barterdex , 1 dollar volume)

[09-Aug-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> wouldn't lack of itnerest in a bull market be more concerning?

[09-Aug-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> gotcha, thx. (re @Regnar: To run a node? No minimum required, but to earn 5.1% rewards on your balance, you need a minimum of 10 KMD in an address, the simplest way to do this is to store funds in Agama (even the lite mode) and press the claim interest button.)

[09-Aug-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Probably best to check out the discord marketing channel for updates and talks on that, telegram generally gets cluttered quickly with other conversations. There are definitely partnerships being worked on, but I think it would be better to wait for official announcements on them, so I won't disclose or help push any rumors there. Here's the link.

[telegram] <Regnar> jl777, I assume ERC20 projects who are looking to migrate off of Ethereum, or launch their main net, would be interested in Komodo as CC becomes more developed. Can you say what that migrating/main net process might look like for those projects? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> running a native wallet, runs a node)

[09-Aug-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> so far so good.

[09-Aug-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the process would be to get a new chain spawned to test the custom contract with and when it is working,to just migrate the ERC20 snapshot to the new chain

[09-Aug-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the CC framework is ready to be coded to and devs can create a custom contract embedded in their chain

[09-Aug-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
txfees in their chain

[09-Aug-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
only tx from their dapp on their chain

[09-Aug-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> And I assume before they migrate to their new chain they can have all the features and things in place to be atomic swap capable, set up for dPoW, and would have the same scaling tech Komodo uses? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> the process would be to get a new chain spawned to test the custom contract with and when it is working,to just migrate the ERC20 snapshot to the new chain)

[09-Aug-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, all can be put in place before doing the snapshot and migrating

[09-Aug-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and everthing other than enabling dPoW can be done without our being involved, though we are happy to help

[09-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Okay so the dPoW part requires Komodo involvement, and GameCredits, Kreds, Utrum, and some other coins have added dPoW to their chains for the extra security. Is this process getting easier to do for established coins that aren't looking to migrate? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> and everthing other than enabling dPoW can be done without our being involved, though we are happy to help)

[09-Aug-18 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as if KMD will survive this bear market, I am confident KMD will survive the next bear market and even the one after that. We have funding for 10+ years of dPoW and while we do have end user deliverables, that is a very expensive marketing wise for customer acquisition. our focus on enabling technologies allows us to run much leaner on the marketing side. and in any case, we dont have millions of dollars to be throwing about left and right for paid placements and listings like many of the other projects do. It will take longer, but as more people learn about KMD, the mentions we will get will be based on KMD attributes and not due to paid placements

[09-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> The main focus for many platforms is to attract devs.. i think the perception of the numbers of devs out is over estimated...  what would you consider to be a "possible application" that can be built on KMD for the benefit of the end user?

[09-Aug-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> again i own KMD, i just want to have a better grasp of KMD's competitive edge

[09-Aug-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> is it only TPS?

[09-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> And if there isn't a lot of money for paid placements.. which is understandable.. how would KMD be better distributed in more hands?

[09-Aug-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
users who come via paid placements dont tend to be very loyal users. the ones who find the solution they need, will tend to use it and getting realusers is what KMD is trying to do

[09-Aug-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> TPS, Privacy features, barterdex

[09-Aug-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> one thing I'm still parsing through is how KMD is to be used (if at all) on Barterdex - assuming atomic swaps are simply chain to chain

[09-Aug-18 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
I wrote 4 reference contracts last month: assets with DEX, faucet, rewards and dice. once written they can be configured without programming

[09-Aug-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> KMD isn't really a go-between, correct?

[09-Aug-18 09:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
assetchains / dPoW / jumblr / 5% interest... the list goes on and on

[09-Aug-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
each CC contract that is written becomes part of the baseline contracts available for all chains

[09-Aug-18 09:36 PM] xRobeSx#5136
The fact that anyone can spawn a new chain in seconds that has a built in faucet, is pretty damn cool

assets/tokens are also pretty important and dice is a classic blockchain game, all these are blockchain enforced trustless implementations

[telegram] <odyseao> average users access your infrastructure via apps, doesn't matter how good your underline techs are, if apps are hard to use, people will leave.  google cloud has better tech than AWS, better engineering team, better talents, but it's lossing big against AWS, internally google said it will only fund it 2 more years if things don't turn around, i know number of people who have left that team, so the infrastructure doesn't matter at the end.   i think KMD team has this engineering mentality thinking that UX/UI is easy, but the opposite is true, designing an user friendly product is hard, even harder than engineering.
