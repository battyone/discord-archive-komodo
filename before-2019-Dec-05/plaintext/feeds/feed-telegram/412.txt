[telegram] <icantgiveyou> Let me ask you a question, why are you guys destroying the Amazon forest not a good idea (re @TonyStarkBR: Brazil (the screenshot is in Portuguese) üëç)

[12-Oct-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> This is off topic, but let's go...
This has been severely misrepresented by mainstream media... Indeed, there was a rise in burnings a couple months ago, but it still was below the yearly averages... Anyway, the Army deployed a special operation to combat the fires (with help from some foreign countries) and the situation is under control!
There are, also, unconfirmed reports or criminal fires made for political exploitation against the government, this is under police investigation!
And to finish, France's Macron involvement was completely political: he exploited the situation trying to veto the free trade agreement between the EU and Mercosur, due to internal pressures from their agriculture producers!
It's been pretty clear, as both the UK and Germany didn't side by him on this issue, defending the trade agreement!
Also, at about the same time, there were several fires in Portugal and no one gave a word about them (which serves to illustrate the political use of the issue).
And last but not least, a significant part of the Amazon fires where in Bolivian soil, not in Brazil!
And no one gave a word about that, as well! (re @icantgiveyou: Let me ask you a question, why are you guys destroying the Amazon forest not a good idea)

[12-Oct-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Anyway, the question is far more complex than what the media portrays.. there are economic and political interests behing this all, including foreign interests!
And the current government decided to go head on against such interests, and since our media is mostly left leaning (and, thus, against him), the government is under permanent attack from the media! (re @icantgiveyou: Let me ask you a question, why are you guys destroying the Amazon forest not a good idea)

[13-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I don't think Coinomi does the rewards, but if you are looking for a mobile wallet, I use Chameleon Pay by Chainzilla. Really beautiful looking wallet, you own the keys, iOS and android, can claim rewards, and you can buy gift cards to places like Amazon, Starbucks, Target, Dominos etc. with crypto in the wallet without KYC.
PTYX, one of the Admin here, runs Chainzilla. (re @chizydon: No holding on binance for some time now but I want to move it to private wallet)

[13-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Another option is of course AtomicDEX

[13-Oct-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Though is in Beta, you can store crypto, own your own keys, and can perform atomic swaps to other crypto without KYC, and claim rewards

[13-Oct-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Another great mobile wallet is Pungo Wallet "multicrypto wallet which supporting +150 tokens
-  Cash in / Cash out for EUR and other currencies within the app
-  Swap from token to token built from within wallet 
-  Gyft cards around the world for Amazon, Netflix, JustEat & 1st class brands!
