[telegram] <DamiansFiel> We are ready for today. Only 9 hours and 40 minutes left. Yesterday I spoke about a long-term strategy. A lot of people DM'ed me about it. It is a quite simple strategy. Our team had contact with various news channels. Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin. This gives our members a perfect window to sell their coins with a decent profit.
We have done a quite similar strategy a few months ago on the coins $DLT and $DNT. The results were amazing. Pictures  will be shared below.

i am working on a plan to restore 80%+ of funds, which will be painful, but survivable for all
i want to protect the small accounts with 100% coverage
but the larger ones, we need to socialize the loss so 90% for the people whose funds got swept, 80% for those who got stolen. make up the different with 5% APR from late claimers and I will chip in 500k
i think it should all work out, but we need to verify that the damage is indeed at the 1 mil KMD level"

[telegram] <yorklab> From the CEO of the Komodor64 team:
"TwilightPunkster K64Today at 2:21 PM
I was planning to keep this announcement for a lot later, but as the CEO of Komodore64, I can give you the following statement.
When Ben Fairbank visited us in the Netherlands, we put some things in writing - but also had some verbal agreements. That there will be a Komodo Foundation and that K64 will migrate to a Komodo "Enterprise" edition in the future. 
For other projects, I have requested our advisor, Lord Ajay Sharma from ASR ventures, former president of Rotary to find the right people to take chair in what we call the K64 Foundation. We already have found a suitable secretary who will be announced on June 14th, and two other positions are still in negotiation. As soon as its passed legal procedures - notary, statutes - the K64 foundation will donate to Komodo Foundation to ensure its health.
Do not worry. Let the Komodo Team investigate and perform fact-finding. We will overcome this.
Together we are strong."

then only that privatekey is compromised
 immediately move any KmD from that privkey's address 
later I would suggest you create a new seed for ledger and transfer all the finds to it even though it is strictly not necessary

[telegram] <Brandflakesss> Does the ocean wallet generate staked Kmd?

[05-Jun-19 11:03 PM] gcharang#6833
yes you can stake in the ocean wallet
but it is native mode
that means you will need to download the blockchain and deal with change addresses
if you don't know what I am talikng about you better use Verus Agama lite mode

I am trying to get all the details I have been huge on komodo for a long time and think it can outshine just about any other technology out their , we now have a new dapp for trading with margin , what and where can i get that and also who knows if the komodo lite wallet was downloaded on my laptop how the hell do i get it off my computer

We strongly recommend moving all funds from Agama (KMD, asset chain coins, and other assets) to a new address as soon as possible.

[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> Im a bit worried. It seems that there is a buch of zilla, ninja and kmd on an address that shows in my agama wallet but which has this statement "you don't own priv keys for this address". What is this address and how do i get the funds out?

[telegram] <Brandflakesss> I've opened my agama wallet, started it in lite mode. Created a new address and recorded the new seeds. Can I transfer my funds to the lite wallet from my native wallet? Is this safe? Is this setting up a versus wallet?

[telegram] <Marco> Admin nobody wants to answer my question here?please tnx (re @Marco: Admin any word of advice for me..had all my kmd here..not showing transaction history or nothing..)

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Use Verus Agama to create new address, consider Komodo Agama compromised for now, if you need more in-depth help goto Komodo discord (re @Brandflakesss: I've opened my agama wallet, started it in lite mode.
