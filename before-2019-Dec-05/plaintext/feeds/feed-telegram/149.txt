[telegram] <Hermes08> Each time you make a transaction a utxo is spent and a reward is generated. The GUI version of the wallet only automates with a button a transaction of sending the balance to your same public address. Even if you send a transaction to another address you will see a reward depending on the uTxos you have in that address . You could verify by checking it on the explorer as well as in your own wallet.
