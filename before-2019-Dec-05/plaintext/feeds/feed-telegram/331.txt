[telegram] <xarux> I agree - but such news is surely used by manipulators! Take a look at the increased trading volume on finding vulnerabilities - aren't these links a single complex scheme for ordinary members of the community and traders? (re @Ggokhangark: There is still chance to go to 2,6 or 2,7 usd. All will be clear from next week according to chart. Of course news can affect to price but we will see it from next week. For now everything is good.)

[telegram] <AireeZahari> so the above 2 addresses are safe wallet?

[05-Jun-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.

[telegram] <Marpheus> Hi all. Where can I creat a paper wallet?

[05-Jun-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> I, too! But those responsible for testing agama punish! They wanted to win the competition "which of the crypto projects are the fastest and most of all updates and releases", but giving priority to this goal, they did not take care of the most important thing - infrastructure vulnerabilities! What the hell is a super-reliable blockchain. -When can funds from it be stolen because of a bad wallet? After all, the infrastructure for the blockchain is what altcoin developers pay attention to! In bitcoin in which notaries assure komodo is impossible like that! Therefore, the index of dominance of Bitcoin will grow even more after a series of similar vulnerabilities! You can build a super passport in the world of cryptocurrency - but if you have an asphalt road for holes and puddles for it, then what is the meaning of your supercar - did you catch the analogy? (re @Ggokhangark: The manipulators were shouting in twitter from this morning. News are every where and price already dumped almost %15. Chart is still alive and looking very nice. According to weekly kmd/usd chart the real move would start from next week. Nothing changed yet. I am very disappointed of this Agama hacking issue but still believe in team.)

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Keytothegate> If you cannot understand the very simple idea that they had "direct access to our funds" BECAUSE of the vulnerability in Agama and not by default, not by design, not by blockchain then this is hopeless. In that case you lack the basic understanding on basics. And this has been pointed out to you by a number of people. Think a little bit and may i suggest re-evaluate your above-mentioned opinion that you would prefer that the attacker had the time to take your coins.

[05-Jun-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> dear companion! I understand this better than you! What vulnerability is not in KOMODO but in the agama ecosystem! And that in komodo it is not relevant - I also understand - but the infrastructure for the chest of drawers is lame! It’s as if the lightning in the BTC also allowed you to get your bitcoins - it wouldn’t speak about the unreliability of bitcoin, but it would tell about the unreliability of lightning - just here - the unreliability of agama! But is it easier for your business on how you lost access to your komodo accounts? Was it a valid trick - an exploit or something else! The real users of the token look at the facts - I had a token, but it is not there - and it is not clear when they will return it - and you have a business every day! And you pay your bills every day!

[telegram] <Keytothegate> It is true that a lot of effort needs to be put on wallet / security testing in the future. This time the vulnerability was spotted at the very last moment and they had time to save almost everything. Although the move made was pretty radical I think it was the only move. Otherwise...the risk was simply too big.
