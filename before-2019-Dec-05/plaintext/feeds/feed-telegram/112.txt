[telegram] <ca888_v1> Wasn't there an bug with an old wallet generator, where the "private key" shown wasn't in hex and had to be hex digested to give the correct private key? I don't quite remember details, do remember vaguely something like this when I had a similar problem. Mine was not realising there was a new Agama release, but I did read a problem like this. I'll try and find a link (re @Sovereign_Warrior: Request for assistance....I logged in just now to my agama wallet and found an empty wallet. Furthermore, my listed wallet address is not my original.  I used my original wallet seed and it's like I stumbled onto a foreign empty wallet. Anyone have any ideas or guidance on how to get back my wallet? I have made no changes to anything to cause this. Thanks)

[telegram] <Sunil> hey all

[22-Aug-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> The demand from KMD will come from: 
1. It's features such as 5.1% APR reward, 51% resistant, scalability, continuing improvements( more and more features will be added, the latest is CC) - Better coin 
2. DEX has 0 confirmation features which requires you to deposit and lock in KMD depending on the size of trades you want to do for a period of times. ( with this use case alone, KMD will be very scarce if DEX adoption scales up pretty quickly) 
3. Multiple ASSETs dividends are paid in KMD ( which required to be purchased in KMD)
4. JUMBLR service requires KMDs to use.
5. dPOW Notarization service will require KMD ( around 300 KMD a year for each project) - Some projects might decide to hold 6000 KMD so that it will produce 300 kmd from 5.1% APR  to substitute for the annual fee - imagine lots of projects doing this. 
6. I believe more services will be developed in the future which will require KMD to use as well because KMD is the fuel of this ecosystems. 
7. Some marketplaces have started accepting KMDs.
8. Some Dicos give bonuses to investors if they invest in KMD - which drives demands.
9. peer2.krd let people use debit card without having to deal with bank - reloadable with KMD / BTC (re @Jamlite: Where does kmd get its value from?  From staking or from icos being raised in kmd?)
