[telegram] <Regnar> 1.Agama lite mode uses SPV single address, you use your seed (or pin if you set it up) to access your address, one KMD address per seed. Agama Native can have multiple addresses as well as Z addresses. 
2. Komodo has two types of addresses, transparent addresses are most common, they are the ones you claim rewards in, and can see balances etc they begin with R, and are often referred to as R addresses. There are also 'Zs' addresses or Z addresses, these are private addresses where balances do not show up on chains. They also make Z transactions where the amount and addresses aren't visible either. These Z addresses however, are being moved to a parallel chain soon, so I wouldn't  mess with them right now. What I mean by this is Komodo uses multi-chain infrastructure, it's how they scale, so Z transactions are going onto a new parallel chain along with new Crypto Conditions smart contracts. This swapping between parallel chains will be seamless and using Komodos MoMoM tech to ensure fungible coins and keep supply consistent. (re @TonyStarkBR: Being new to KMD, I have some doubts:
1) Agama wallet (SPV mode) uses a single, fixed address? It seems to me so...
2) what kind of addresses do we have and how to recognize them?)

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Hi!
Thanks for your answers!
Next round ...
1) is it possible to convert an existing SPV wallet into native? Or somehow import that address into a native wallet?
2) Komodo derives from Zcash, right? Can I send transactions between Z addresses without passing through a R address? Can I send from Z to R and vice versa?
3) I'm playing around with the QT wallet. Why we don't have binaries for Linux and Mac? Only for Windows? Is it some kind of way to force users to Agama instead of QT? (re @Regnar: 1.Agama lite mode uses SPV single address, you use your seed (or pin if you set it up) to access your address, one KMD address per seed.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> 1) Yes 2) Yes to all however after the 15th privacy functionality will be moved to a sidechain , still will function on there the same way.  3) Because the developer who volunteered to make a QT has only made it for Windows so far and has other higher priority and I am assuming paid as well work ahead of a labor of love.  GUI wallets , QT or otherwise are a convenience for the user. If it were up to the devs, everyone would just be using command line , like Zcash has done and offloaded GUI wallet support to 3rd parties .

Correct they don‚Äôt afaik, I know that one of the devs that works with us a lot is maintains all Windows Zcash based wallets.
