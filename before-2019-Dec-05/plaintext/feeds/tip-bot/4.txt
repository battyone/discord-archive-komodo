@FishyGuts I agree with you.

[10-Oct-18 06:04 PM] vergotle#4825
The bot dev should also get something.

[10-Oct-18 06:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
5% of each withdraw fee is only 0.001 KMD.   I'd even think 10% is wholly acceptable.

Plus it encourages "upkeep"  not that I think we have to worry about that.,   @sclear killed it.   19 hours from my first contact to first tip... including syncing the chain.

@sclear really deserves some reward and I like your suggestions @FishyGuts.  He should at least get 5%.

@FishyGuts thanks again for my first komodo....keep up the good work......

[10-Oct-18 06:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Also,  I am having @sclear activate the 10% dev fee from withdraw fees to him.   They either go to the bot to be sent back to us, or back to him to encourage development and growth.  
And besides,  it is literally 1/4 of one penny.... Nobody has a prob with that yea?   Not like we're withdrawing 350 times a day,

[10-Oct-18 06:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would be surprised if he ended up with 1 KMD because of it over the course of a year üòÑ

[10-Oct-18 06:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If anyone has an issue with it, let me know.   He's glad to leave it out but I think he deserves it.

If you are on Android they just released Agama for Android.    The Agama desktop version works good too.  

Google search ‚ÄúKomodo paper wallet generator‚Äù. I think the link is on their official site.
