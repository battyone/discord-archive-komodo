[14-Jan-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <stock999> KYC is a seed of evil by default

[14-Jan-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Wallets must be protected by technology first of all.  Laws, KYC and an army of hungry lawyers can protect nobody.

[14-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think KYC is something we won't be able to get away with due to anti money laundering

[14-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> but when it's implemented badly it can have bad effects on the users.

[14-Jan-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> From a user's perspective I think we need a better solution to KYC. Something that allows us to verify users but not divulging all of the data.

[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> the interface is amazing

[14-Jan-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the next version will be much better with the newsletter integration and some changes in the transitions which I don't like at all.

[14-Jan-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The flip motion will be changed for a side to motion like coinomi

[14-Jan-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Regnar has his hands on the android version and we have 2 more people to test the ios version.

[14-Jan-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <TheLordNoble> Looks pretty impressive.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @TheLordNoble thank you, it has a long way to go still but it's getting there

Good time of the day!
I would love to share an idea for the dapp and hopefully find people who resonate with it and would help to manifest it.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Ledger in Mobile will be coming soon. You better bet Chameleon will have it

[15-Jan-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Could it be possible? üòâ

[15-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We will wait to see how secure it is before implementing but it looks promising

[16-Jan-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Well, Ledger is a reputable manufacturer. But it is not an open source code, right?

[16-Jan-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> On my mind the open source is much better than any reputation, as for a security

[16-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> There are no open source hardware wallets at the moment

[16-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The ledger device is the most secure hardware wallet as its the only one with a special chip set made to hold the keys. Trezor doesn't have any special chips

[16-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'm not too concerned with the USB as I am with the Bluetooth connection.

[16-Jan-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Just two weeks :zilla3:
