[Hollowman9000#3344] So the zilla we already have will be how the snapshot is gathered?

[12-Jul-18 11:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] no, the zilla you already have is live

[12-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] you can trade it on hyperdex and soon on a CEX

[12-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Gordon Komodo#7477] similar to the time when we get vote2018 coin

[12-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] My timing has been bad today

[12-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] to qualify for the snapshot you have to have a minimum of 500 KMD in your address

[12-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the 1 million zilla will be distrubted among those addresses based on balance

[12-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] The address which holds zilla?

[12-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] whichever address you want brother

[12-Jul-18 11:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] as long as it's a Komodo address of cvourse

[12-Jul-18 11:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Ok for all the new people, here's the deal with the airdrops: 

There are two types of airdrops for $ZILLA
1) Discord Airdrops

PTYX will initiate the command and then you just need to reply with your Zilla address generated from your agama wallet. These airdrops happen randomly throughout the day. 

2) Holding $KMD in your agama wallet.

There is an airdrop for KMD holders if they hold more than 500 KMD in their Agama wallet. The amount of zilla received will depend on total number of wallets and KMD held. 1M coins will be split between these holders. The snapshot for this airdrop is august 15th and coins are distributed about two weeks later.

[12-Jul-18 11:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the discord mini drops don't have anything to do with the main drop

[12-Jul-18 11:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] So people who never heard of zilla yet have a balance greater than 500 will get the airdrop?

[12-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the first one yes

[12-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] there are 2 airdrops if you look at the litepaper

[12-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the second one will require a registration

[12-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Ah, might get some dahmpage there

[12-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Gotcha

[12-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] i doubt it since there won't be places to dahmp

[12-Jul-18 11:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Bdex

[12-Jul-18 11:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] but that's up to the market to decide.

[12-Jul-18 11:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] i

[12-Jul-18 11:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Litepaper link?

[12-Jul-18 11:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cye#9860] @PTYX ok so KMD must be held on AGAMA wallet for snapshot and not in GuardaÂ  Komodo Wallet, is that correct?

[12-Jul-18 11:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] if you can export your guarda privatekey which i'm sure you can, then you can hold it in guarda

[12-Jul-18 11:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] you can export your privatekey and use it in Agama to see your zilla after the drop

[12-Jul-18 11:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Gordon Komodo#7477] somebody was asking about holding it in ledger nano https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/8yb3lj/airdrop_for_komodo/

[martiniblanco#4080] Is there a mobile wallet or web wallet from KMD? I don't have desktop.

[12-Jul-18 11:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Gordon Komodo#7477] there is an experimental web wallet https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet

https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet
Agama Web Wallet
Agama web wallet

[12-Jul-18 11:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] What does experimental mean? Is it save to use?

[12-Jul-18 11:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] And also eligible for airdrop and zilla?

[12-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Gordon Komodo#7477] I have used it a few times just to check my balance. So far no problem for me. Yes, it is eligible, because the fund in stored in the blockchain, as long as you have access to the private key of the address that have the fund, you can access the airdrop as well.

[13-Jul-18 12:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] Team members normally recommend  only putting a small amount on the web wallet. I've never heard of any issues though.

[13-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown Guarda Wallet

[13-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] A good portion of the airdrop will be lost to exchange addresses

[13-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] First one anyway

[13-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Are they excluded?

[13-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] i'm working on mapping out as many exchange addresses as i can

[13-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] but i cannot filter all of them

[13-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] some are known, others aren't

[13-Jul-18 12:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Gotcha

[13-Jul-18 12:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Good point  @Hollowman9000

[13-Jul-18 12:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Is there a functioning rich list anywhere?

[13-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] I wonder what percentage of the total supply exists in addresses <500

[13-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] TotSup - (known exchange addresses) - (sum of KMD in <500 addresses)

[13-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Rough guesstimate what the amount is eligible for the airdrop so far?

[13-Jul-18 12:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I think 5 ish was the number.

[13-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cye#9860] @PTYX If I posted my KMD Wallet Address from Guarda Wallet for the 1 Zilla airdrop would I have lost that 1 Zilla that was won?

[13-Jul-18 12:16 AM] PTYX#6840
as long as you can export the privatekey you will be able to access it.

[13-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] The wallet you use is simply how you access that address

[13-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cye#9860] Ok cool

[13-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] The privkey can be stuck into any wallet

[13-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Not sure how nano works

[13-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Can you export priv keys from them or are you stuck with trusting it?

[13-Jul-18 12:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] guarda is a non-custodial wallet. They let users hold their privatkeys. Coinomi does too

[13-Jul-18 12:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] that means they can take those privatekeys and import them into another wallet.

[13-Jul-18 12:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Thanks for help to all.
atomicexplorer wallet let me export priv keys also or not?

[13-Jul-18 12:24 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the webwallet is a version of Agama so I believe so yes but I haven't done much testing on the web wallet

[13-Jul-18 12:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] Probably need to make sure your 500KMD is actually in one address, as the wallet will display and combine balances in multiple addresses

[13-Jul-18 12:32 AM] Atlaszka#2910
Will Larger Nano addresses able to participate in the airdrop?

[13-Jul-18 12:34 AM] Atlaszka#2910
Or claim Zilla later from Ledger addresses I mean

[13-Jul-18 12:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] @Ptyx thx. It's possible with both wallets. It's called WIF keys on Agama web wallet and only seen when wallet is active

[13-Jul-18 12:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Could you send a Zilla to check it?
Appreciate it.

[13-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] will distribution be linear?

[13-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] 500kmd = 1 share

[13-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] 1000kmd = 2 shares

[13-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Etc

[13-Jul-18 12:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] 750kmd = 1.5 shares

[13-Jul-18 12:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] yes

[13-Jul-18 12:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[goldenman#7301] 500kmd = 1 share = 1 ZILLA ?

[13-Jul-18 12:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] no

[13-Jul-18 12:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] ðŸ˜•

[13-Jul-18 12:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] (Your share / total eligible shares) * 1,000,000 zilla

[13-Jul-18 12:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] one share means one portion of the 1 million that is equaly divided based on the balance of addresses above 500 KMD.

[13-Jul-18 12:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it seems no matter how we word it, people are confused

[13-Jul-18 12:59 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] I figured 5% KMD supply below <500 per account per earlier discussion

[13-Jul-18 12:59 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Take another 15% on known exchange accounts

[13-Jul-18 12:59 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] So
