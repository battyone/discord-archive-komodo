[Dplex#5870] for the 500 Komodo in Aug, when does it need to be in the wallet. can it be transfered all at once on the day?

[19-Jul-18 11:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it needs to be in the wallet by the time we do the snapshot. So best thing is not to move it until we announce it's complete

[19-Jul-18 11:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Why's everyone selling kmd

[19-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] 2 drops left in #deleted-channel

[19-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] gogogo

[19-Jul-18 11:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @AkiraX if you look at alt in general, most of them got sold today. it has nothing to do with KMD

[19-Jul-18 11:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] you seem to look at prices too much. in short term there is too much noise in these movements. if you are not a trader it's better for your mental health to not look closely at the markets

[19-Jul-18 11:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Hehe

[19-Jul-18 11:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] signal to noise ratio is way off in favour of noise. take a longer view and everything will work out

[19-Jul-18 11:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] of course if you invested in solid projects ðŸ˜„

[20-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[smellycouch#3071] @crumb privacy coins are getting a shitkicking lately and its total fucking bullshit.   Iike I need the whole fucking world to know when I made a transaction.   Fuck that

[20-Jul-18 03:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Not seeing Zilla in Hyperdex. Am I missing something?

[grim_chiefer#6001] @PTYX I downloaded the latest version for osx and itâ€™s not showing for me. Iâ€™ll uninstall and try again.  V0.1.0 alpha 10 is the one I used

[20-Jul-18 04:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Just reloaded it and same. Latest version - no Zilla listed to trade.

[AkiraX#8269] No way I can accumulate 500 kmd

[20-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Welcome new peeps

[20-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Ok for all the new people, here's the deal with the airdrops: 

There are two types of airdrops for $ZILLA
1) Discord Airdrops

PTYX will initiate the command and then you just need to reply with your Zilla address generated from your agama wallet. These airdrops happen randomly throughout the day. 

2) Holding $KMD in your agama wallet.

There is an airdrop for KMD holders if they hold more than 500 KMD in their Agama wallet. The amount of zilla received will depend on total number of wallets and KMD held. 1M coins will be split between these holders. The snapshot for this airdrop is august 15th and coins are distributed about two weeks later.

[20-Jul-18 11:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Also it's worth noting that Discord airdrops will typically happen in a new channel, not in #deleted-channel

[cheeweon#5786] pre ico is  in progress?

[20-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We added it to the schedule but the pre-ico has been capped already

[20-Jul-18 12:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We had a request for a pre-ico investor that we decided to take. So we allocated 1 million zilla the pre-ico which we already sold. The total was 1 million Zilla for $0.35 each.

[20-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Is anyone having issues with the cryptoslate.com link?

[20-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I think I'm missing something, I don't see anything ChainZilla related on that site.

[20-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Hmmm

[20-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] yes

[crumb#2550] worked for me just fine

[20-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] i guess the faucet is not working right now

[20-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i stopped working already yesterday. PTYX said they are working on a new one

[20-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[20-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I turned on my VPN and now it works.

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] yes we already have the antibot features ready

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @yorklab probably because i blocked the US

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] and other countries

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] Yep.

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] cool

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] So you mean to tell me

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] germany also blocked? ðŸ˜„

[20-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] You built a wall around the US?

[20-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] ;DDD

[20-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] :p

[20-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I stated earlier that I had to use my VPN to see the link posted above, but the country I used was Canada, and according the site, that's one of the countries not allowed in the crowdsale.

[20-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] I could not view it either, from The Netherlands

[20-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it could be the way the dns is routing the connection?

[20-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] also it's a brand new listing. maybe they have different servers for different regions
