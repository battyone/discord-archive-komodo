[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Ok so if no-one minds playing our hands open, so to speak- are you all looking for your 11 words between moon and root? I.e. following the red line only? Or then following the solid / dashed lines through the Chainzilla compass rose, the heart, the Bog, then Satoshi?

[03-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> so much for follwing the lines ðŸ¤¦

[03-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> and always tried both combinations ...

[03-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> They were in line.

[03-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Just not explicit line.

[03-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> I wouldn't guess, I used the word "dog"

[03-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> pirate is in the middle not on the line

[03-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Bizonacci is looking at Satoshi and Satoshi is looking at the pirate

[03-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <OszyðŸ¤ª> looking? lol ðŸ˜„

[03-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <figgy132> I had been trying all day but used czbinance instead of satoshi haha

[03-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> gratz

[03-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <figgy132> Got the order of words from my 7 year old, she said they're all looking at each other haha

[03-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> biz looks on satoshi ... or they on one line ... but i think that pirate can be intermediate point on path biz -> satoshi ... so i doubt about order 10 and 11 ...
