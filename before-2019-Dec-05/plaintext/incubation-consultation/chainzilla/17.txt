[PTYX#6840] it's supposed to be for whoever is online. The airdrops aren't meant to have you  glued to your phone.

[15-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Ok, at least @Unknown , @Unknown, @Unknown and @Unknown are sock puppet accounts, please ban.

[15-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If I see an address that i feel is a bot, someone else will get the reward
