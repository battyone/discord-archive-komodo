[marktyler#0324] Question on the czilla airdrops? If you ‚Äúwin‚Äù one when does it get sent?

[18-Jul-18 10:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] Yes. Shows up pretty quick.

[18-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] Maybe a few minutes later from what I've seen.

[18-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[marktyler#0324] Hmmm. Is there a block explorer /website to check it?

[18-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[-Hegemon-#3867] Hey guys

[19-Jul-18 05:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[-Hegemon-#3867] Will I get funds I I have a private key created some time ago?

[19-Jul-18 06:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @Unknown how do you mean?

[19-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[cheeweon#5786] It may be a rather silly question, but I wonder why you choose NEM,QTUM,Ethrium?  and Do you plan to expand to other platforms?

[19-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] And KMD, PTYX was a developer on the Komodo team

[19-Jul-18 08:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I think KMD/NEM/QTUM are the main ones

[Bo#8264] Already done üòÉ

[19-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] the faucet still not working

[19-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Don't fret. A second faucet is being worked on by the plumber @webworker01 as we speak

[19-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He's laying down the pipeline (no pun intended)

[19-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] so is ZILLA on sale right now or it will be after airdrop ?

[19-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Zilla is fully tradeable

[19-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] On hyperDex

[19-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] And after the airdrop we will be on coinexchange

[19-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[PTYX#6840] abusing the faucet?

[19-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Cryptoon#3362] kraster - afgelopen maandag om 16:08
Stop accusing, you have no evidence, I have not done anything that is bad, I have claimed as any user in my directions manually the reward of the faucet and I can pass if the owners of the faucet wanted a record of how I made it manually, as well as the purchase agreements I've made, so shut up

[19-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Bo#8264] yes

[19-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's difficult to stop. I'll have to Lower the amount and either way it's offline until the second one comes online

[19-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] This transaction for example

[19-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] The only thing you could probably do is blacklist those adresses from the faucet

[19-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] No much we can do against skynet. Blacklisting doesn't do anything

[19-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He can generate more

[19-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But as it's probably all scripts it wouldnt be too hard to cretae new one

[19-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] ones*

[19-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'll have to add social media actions

[19-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] jep

[19-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yeah thanks cryptoon, you were the one who originally did the work to find his address

[19-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're working out a solution

[19-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I figured this would happen and that's why we tested small amounts

[19-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It did the job though üòÄ

[19-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Our community is growing and the faucet played a part

[19-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] I'm sure you'll come up with some elegant solution :)

[19-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Now we even got bot pirates

[19-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Now all we need is eth spammers on the twitter account

[19-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
