[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Most poor people want to keep being poor. Sad truth. (coming from a former very poor boy).

[24-Jan-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> I understand that you must follow the system's requirements, including KYC and other attributes,  if you want to work as a  legal company,   No other way

[24-Jan-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I've come to the conclusion that it's a mental state

[24-Jan-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The daily routine and hustle doesn't allow for anything more than day to day planning

[24-Jan-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Most people live paycheck to paycheck. They get sucked into the credit thing. End up owing their entire lives

[24-Jan-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I was lucky to have never taken credit. I was even denied credit for not having any credit history.

[24-Jan-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's like this everywhere. And until you break from that mental state it's difficult to think of anything different or think longterm. There are exceptions of course.

[24-Jan-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> I think this is also because of system: they try to keep people as uneducated in financial,  to force them do not think too much, only work day by day

[24-Jan-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Like running in infinity circle

[24-Jan-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Oh definitely I agree with that. Keep the sheep blind

[24-Jan-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> And they have a reason to act so. I mean system, government. Because we feed them at least 1/3 of our work

[24-Jan-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Better to say 2/3

[24-Jan-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> In some EU countries is up to 60%

[24-Jan-19 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> That is just the official income tax.  But how many more  kinds of taxes there are!

[24-Jan-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> I drive every day, take gas for my car. Taxes are at least a half of gas price , for instance

[24-Jan-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Taxes are included in everything that we buy daily for our needs. Enduser pays all of them, i.e we pay

[24-Jan-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So probably, it is much more than 60%, if assume all of this

[24-Jan-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah i didn't take that into account. With taxes it's upwards to 75%

[24-Jan-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> or more in some countries

[24-Jan-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> that's pretty crazy to me.

[24-Jan-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Also add a tax for my house that is my own, for the piece of  land under the house  (which i bought at full price a while ago) ðŸ˜€

[24-Jan-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> And there are many other taxes. There is not for air yet, fortunately

[24-Jan-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> But when i bring kids to school, need a doctor's help,  repair a road near my house, etc.  - i have to pay by myself for all of this. Nobody helps, nobody care.

[24-Jan-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Corrupted courts doesn't protect me too. That's why i hate this System. I just don't want to feed them

[24-Jan-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> nothing is your own

[24-Jan-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> not even yourself

[24-Jan-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So i take KYC negatively too,  just as one of attributes of  this system. They must die all togever, all attributes, with no exception. Should went to history.

[24-Jan-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> We should go back to what it was before.

[24-Jan-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Not long ago.

[24-Jan-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> It happens that people have short memory.

[24-Jan-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> People always used to dream get out of control, don't share hardly earned wealth.

[24-Jan-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Cryptocurrency is not the first attempt. There were several digital currencies, such as egold, liberty, etc. But all of them were squashed by system.

[24-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Blockchain gives us a real chance because of decentralization. Authorities may talk everything, but really they can not neither control nor destroy crypto

[24-Jan-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So we should not help them by own hands, we should not bring these attributes such as KYC  to crypto.

[24-Jan-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Well, everybody has a free choice what to think about this and what to do. The time will say the truth, as always.

[24-Jan-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> If you keep an elephant tied to a tree for long enough, it will learn to stay there when you say, even in absence of any ties.

[24-Jan-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> KYC is yet another "stay there where i say", but this time there are no ties.

[24-Jan-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> And we are the dumb elephant.

[24-Jan-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> The funny thing is, maybe the elephant is not dumb, and it's just pretending to obey.

[24-Jan-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> That's why i say "necessary temporary evil".

[24-Jan-19 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> At least we should not tie ourselves by own hands

[25-Jan-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> How do I register for the ICO?

[25-Jan-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @kalel we will release the purchase guide tomorrow which is a video tutorial that explains what you have to do. It's easy though. On February 1st you will navigate to ico.chainzilla.io and the buy button will be activated at 12 pm gmt.

[25-Jan-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> @PTYX Thanks for the prompt and clear response, I'm super excited to invest in this.

[25-Jan-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We all appreciate the support. In the coming week we are going to release the new version of Chameleon. Keep an eye out on that ðŸ˜„

[25-Jan-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> Do all the transactions on Chameleon utilizes the NIX ghost protocol?

[25-Jan-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> No it doesn't but it's a possibility in the future. I chatted with matthew recently and he mentioned that there are some developments coming that they have been working on in regards to the dex manager.

[25-Jan-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Chameleon is in its initial phase and the goal was to design a good looking, easy to use, and easy to sell wallet.

[25-Jan-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's one of the main tools we will use to offer other projects a managed or white-label solution when they launch their own token for whichever purpose. As Chameleon evolves, there will be more complex things added to it. After the ICO we will announce great news regarding an integration coming to the wallet which will make our wallet more usable.

[25-Jan-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> Wonderful, will be looking out for the new version in the coming weeks and the video tutorial tomorrow, cheers

[25-Jan-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hermes> Paypal blocks my transactions so they are just wanting to loose my business over here...

[25-Jan-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Paypal is ðŸ’©

[25-Jan-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> a pile of it

[25-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Paypal sucks

[25-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Western Union sucks harder

[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> i seen that already voted

[25-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> not a fan ðŸ˜„ haha

[25-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Well I see all that is happening and I am having a hard time comprehending how people can follow him blindly

[25-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> because people are idiots?

[25-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> So I figured a poll would give us a good idea what people really think

[25-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Lol

[25-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Some are yes

[25-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> i guess its because he has money

[25-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> if he was broke he would have about 100 followers but he does have money

[25-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> everyone follows the money

[25-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> lol

[25-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> He's the kardashian of crypto

[25-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> LOL

[25-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> hahahaha

[25-Jan-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Interesting analogy

[25-Jan-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I don't know.....i think he is looking more like tekashi 69

[25-Jan-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Kardashian never went to jail

[25-Jan-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> but in all seriousness even if what he says is true the way he acts doesn't help him in anyway

[25-Jan-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> if you act the way he does most people won't take you seriously even if you are speaking the truth

[25-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I agree. His actions aren't that of someone who is trying to do good. It's of someone who is trying to save their ass

[25-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> People are now raising funds for his defense. Smh

[25-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> what are you serious?

[25-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah

[25-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> so he makes money from shilling coins.. his followers prob lost money and now they are raising funds for him

[25-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Exactly

[25-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's crazy
