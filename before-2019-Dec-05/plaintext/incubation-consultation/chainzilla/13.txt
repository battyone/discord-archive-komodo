[AkiraX#8269] What's stopping you from creating a billion addresses and getting airdrops?

[14-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I try but didn't get it yesterday or today

[14-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[14-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] It worked the other day so wasn't expecting an issue

[14-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @AkiraX try to copy and paste the addresses when airdrop is going ..no shot

[14-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] @AkiraX these random ones last about 10 seconds there isn't time to claim more than once😂

[14-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] The world needs Komodo transaction speed. ETH having problems again.

[14-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I don't think it's working now. Something about too many UTXOs I think.

[14-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] @KLMJ1 let's spread the word!

[14-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] I am telling everyone I see. But I am glued to my screen waiting for the airdrops.

[14-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Socialism is so outdated

[14-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies you tell me since Belgium has the highest min wage and highest dole out of any EU, u don’t even wanna work in Belgium, that’s what I call socialism

[14-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I tried the Pearl pay faucet on laptop Edge browser and it said I had enough and come back in 1411 minutes...lol I didn't get anything from the faucets. I have better luck getting the airdrops here than a faucet!

[Robert Naus#9564] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies Vancouver has decent weather great summer and beaches and you can ski near by during whole winter season, but it’s expensive to buy house there

[14-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] There are a lot of beautiful places in the world but I'm partial to the US just not California or New York LOL
