[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Actually that's how chameleon came to be developed

[09-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We aren't stopping. What we are doing is changing the roadmap to reflect the priorities. Instead of expanding our app suite we will focus on polishing Chameleon and begin monetizing it.

[09-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> getting to positive cash flow is always a very good idea

ICO Update ‚Äì chainzilla ‚Äì Medium
First of all we would like to thank each and every community member that contributed to the token sale. It‚Äôs been one week since the ICO‚Ä¶
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*OHR6eyENk2DiEsMc6Ax2JA.png

[09-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'm super pumped about Cybertech. Chameleon can win that first place. There's a small money award but it's a seeding ground for VCs which is sponsored by the Israeli embassy.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> After Cybertech it's off to the races with Binance Labs.

[10-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> @PTYX sad that it did not work üòü

[10-Feb-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Not enough people wanted to participate, i think it's not the result we wanted but it gives us an honest perspective of the market.

[10-Feb-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The plan is to adjust towards venture capital instead of token sale funds. We should have done that from the beginning in retrospect.

[10-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Those who hold ZILLA will be rewarded through Chameleon Pay. We will keep the token relevant and implement more solutions around the zilla chain.

[10-Feb-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We will keep everyone updated on the results of the startup competition we have enrolled in and any new partnerships. The dev team is waiting on an sdk to implement the giftcard and mobile phone refill purchase module.

[10-Feb-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I expect that to be implemented before the end of the quarter.

[10-Feb-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> Is there a bonus plan for ICO participants to prevent extradition?

[10-Feb-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I have plans to reward the participants and zilla holders in general with a type of "stake reward" through Chameleon

[10-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We are still looking at different mechanisms to implement the reward feature but it's coming. The 1 M tokens designated for airdrops will be distributed through that mechanism to incentivize the use of the wallet and holding of the token.

[10-Feb-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Currently we are competing at CyberTech, Binance Labs, and NEM Ventures

[10-Feb-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> When will it end?

[10-Feb-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the result of Cybertech will be in on the 22, the same day we pitch

[10-Feb-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We have a second intereview with the Binance team next week to present in private

[10-Feb-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Binance results will be in by May 3rd

[10-Feb-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> If we pass the may 3rd round we have to go to Singapore and pitch

[dscrd-cz] <crumb> complete utter nonsense, 99.99% of that law has no real benefit to everyday internet users. it just serves the interest of big media/music industries. what's really disturbing is that the EU Commission says this new law is actually completely beneficial to ALL internet users.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Even though it's not ideal, we are not going to throw in the towel. Several of our services and now wallet are ready to offer. We will focus on monetizing, fiat integration, and we will find venture capital funds in exchange for company equity.

[17-Feb-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> Will it be in the buy-back process?

[17-Feb-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> You can get a refund if you participated in the ICO but the plan is to keep developing and using the ZILLA chain as a means of rewards, payment, and hosting smart contracts in the future.

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The tokens that are in circulation will remain in circulation and we don't plan on carrying out any more token sales.

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> what kind of contracts?

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It depends on what CC evolves into

[17-Feb-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's not something we can do right now but it's definitely a possibility to create non-custodial contracts for payouts or exchanges through cryptoconditions

[17-Feb-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Chameleon will have exchange features, some centralized and dex integrations

[17-Feb-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763

Just one question.. i saw that being on digitalprice.io but no volume and no trading.. will it be removed from dp? are there any plans to be listed on any exchange some day?

yes and i hope you will win that final üòÉ

[20-Feb-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> i don't think so
