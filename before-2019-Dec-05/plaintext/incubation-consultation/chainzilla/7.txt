[Cryptoon#3362] @Steve10 I mean the actual wallet where the exchagne holds the funds

[13-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Bittrex has a wallet where it holds all the kmd it's members has

[13-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] So if that wallet also gets an airdrop, bittrex get's to keep the zilla 😃

[13-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] That is what I meant

[13-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] My understanding is that they will eliminate those addresses so that we get more of the 1 million Zilla

[13-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Roger, that was what I was wondering

[13-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I always assume a lot of people still keep their coins on an exchange

[13-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] How can you tell what addresses are exchange addresses o:

[13-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I think the team knows most exchange adresses

[13-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] @Deleted User  I don't know how they can tell but I thought I caught yesterday somebody mentioning exchanges would be excluded

[13-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] On the conversation about team  members earlier.  Several things to remember:

1. It's very new
2. They are not trying to create a new blockchain, but help others launch on already completed platforms.

They will be creating or improving interfaces though which will take some talented Devs, so I'm sure it will grow over time.

[st3rling0x#1568] The designer and ux/ui specialist is already working on the dico app redesign.

[13-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] Team members will come when we find more suitable members. We can include as part of the team a list of our external assets if that adds to the team page.

[13-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] @PTYX the freelancers

[13-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it's not a priority right now

[13-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] but i'll take it all into consideration for website 1.2

[13-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] we are in the process of finding a fulltime community manager. once we have the social media handled i'll focus on the website and team page.

[13-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown is helping us with that.
