We are also participating in the Binance Labs BUIDL competition for funding. So the team is busy making the presentations. As for the ICO, we will make an update on the next steps for those who participated and want to make refunds. At this rate, it doesn't seem we will make the minimum.

[08-Feb-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @enfarktus it's unfortunate but we're not panicking. We'll publish an update in a few hours with the action plan.

[dscrd-cz] <crumb> @PTYX i seem to remember that Chainzilla had an early stage funding round. so if i remember correctly, then you luckily have at least minimum funding and don't need to worry about completely shutting down. perhaps you can't do as much stuff as you'd like, but still you can keep going? keep up the good work!
