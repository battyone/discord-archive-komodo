[djithbit#3171] im interested in moving my mining hardware to ukraine.. by preference Lviv region :d

[15-Jul-18 08:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] but i don't speak russian at all.. i live in belgium

[15-Jul-18 08:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] was thinking of renting a space there to setup the rigs there..

[15-Jul-18 08:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] As electricity rates are the cheapest in ukraine from all europe... my guess is that there are huge mining farms there

[15-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[BlackzetSS#9025] i'm from kiev

[15-Jul-18 09:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Would put some rigs there 😄 😄

[15-Jul-18 09:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies I'm from Eastern Europe (Romania)my advice have a short trip if you would like to visit Ukraine and do a research there,is not easy and contracts are not the best when you rent something,better buy a house and build your own place and move your mining rigs

[15-Jul-18 09:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] To buy a property will not be more than 30k dollars with huge Land(over. 1000sq2

[15-Jul-18 09:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Would be best option indeed but to build my own place.. afraid i dont have the funds 😄

[15-Jul-18 09:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Realy??!!

[15-Jul-18 09:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[15-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] In Hungary you find very cheap houses and is secure but I don't know about the price for electricity

[15-Jul-18 09:24 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] 3x that of ukraine 😛

[15-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @bogybogy I would stay away from Ukraine it’s not as safe plus Russians can come anytime. I go for MonteNegro or Bulgaria maybe

[martiniblanco#4080] @Robert Naus afraid of Russians? :)

[15-Jul-18 09:58 AM] bogybogy#3962
The only issue I see in the Ukrain is coruption,curuption kills everywhere the business and, everywhere you find great people and to mention that  Russians can come ocuppy Ukraine is just misleading, Ukraine is sovereign country and the issue what they have   the part lost is more complicated and we get involved in story's where we don't have enough information for reality

[15-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] @Unknown word!

[15-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I come from Czech and we generally have pretty bad history with Russia so I just don’t like them, that’s all

[15-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] I have only positive experience with russians if you keep them as friends.

[15-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] As with all humans actually

[15-Jul-18 10:19 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I got a list like of countries that i don’t like to do business with, Russia,Nigeria,Pakistan,Romania lead the way

[15-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] add belgium to it 😄

[15-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies you the first Belgian I met

[15-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] @Robert Naus you can't blame countries for political issues,I'm from Romania...so maybe I don't fit ......

[15-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] When in the world start to be economically problems always we blame others,BTC give the opportunity the world to be connected

[15-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] I give examples...1960 to 1988 in Romania we got students from Pakistan,Nigeria third world countries , they come to study and they became great doctors,pilots, mathematician,do you know Russia got most of the best cryptographic  Developers in the world,we got great projects,so jews and French suppose to hate German for what happens in the sec world war.... what happens is history and we have to look to figure,BTC technology doesn't care about colour of the skin, religious, sexual orientation and location

[15-Jul-18 11:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @bogybogy I don’t blame anyone all I said I don’t do business with them...as a precautionary measure. I do have some friends from Romania and Russia but that doesn’t change my overall view.

[15-Jul-18 11:45 AM] bogybogy#3962
I'm sorry to hear that...we find scammers everywhere true,but with good  research maybe you can find great people who can do business

[15-Jul-18 11:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Find komodo price very stable nowadays..

[15-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] Kmd will need a bit more time until will be mature but I strongly believe they are ahead over a year from other blockchain platforms

[15-Jul-18 11:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] When we will have a huge hack to a centralized blockchain and exchange and I'm sure will be people will not look to komodo

[15-Jul-18 11:51 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] At the moment for 90 % of projects and people involved in.crypto the only reason. Is value in USD

[15-Jul-18 11:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] Logical decentralization has the zero probability of system failure and can tolerate any accidental faults in the system. A attack aimed at disestablishing the system will have minimal or null effect on it. Lastly, a local system cannot act independently which also maximize the efficiency of the decentralized system as a whole.
