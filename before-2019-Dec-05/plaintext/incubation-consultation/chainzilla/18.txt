[caex#1831] maybe something for consolation?

[15-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] I tried it that way

[15-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] we are Komodos, not geckos. Komodos don't console each other

[15-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] lol

[15-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[15-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I'm on cell 99% of the time, too hard looking up stuff like that

[PTYX#6840] or connection speed

[15-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] I was able to visualize the graphic but couldnt remember the specific date because i hadnt looked at it in a while

[15-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Bo#8264] Is it a problem for you guys that some people (like me) are watching this discord closely?
I haveit open in a tab on my PC all the time, during soccer and whatever.
Also I have discord on my phone with notifications on, for when I'm on the road.
On both I have the KMD address in memory for fast pasting if the airdrop happens.

[15-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] This question is for @PTYX and @Deleted User

[15-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] @Herman  I'm the same way just üíØ on the phone

[PTYX#6840] I leave it up to the user to follow his heart. I personally don't have any reservations about it :)

[15-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'm watching channels in my sleep

[15-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Herman @Steve10 there is no problem in being fast. The problem is with sock puppet accounts. People who never wrote a comment, and suddenly are the first at every round.

[15-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Herman or do you mean you want to monitor in a more official basis?

[15-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] I see, I couldn't make a sockpuppet account if I wanted to

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] @PTYX I don't know. That's not what I meant right now.
But by @Deleted User 's reactions up here it seemed he was not happy. Or was he just checking the bots?

[Steve10#5203] I'm lucky I figured out just the basics of discord let alone all of that...I just figured out I could delete my own comment yesterday hahaha

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] We know Bo doesn't have a bot. He missed out the other day because he needed to go to toiletüí©

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Oops ... sry

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] make 1 bigger airdrop and at the end

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] this is the best solution

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There is nothing wrong with a little paranoia

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] @KLMJ1 right üòÉ

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I will do some digging as well on the bit situation and order some changes

[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We can make it smarter

[15-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Perfect

[15-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Herman it's ok if you are fast and always win. Just take part in the community, those accounts banned never wrote a comment, new to Discord... Even if legit, they were doing 0 favor to this community.

[15-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] I just wanted to check. Thanks guys

[15-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] @Herman  don't you know you are suppose to take your phone with you to üí©

[15-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] forgot that!

[15-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Be careful with pinkeye

[15-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] I think a few new people may be coming to this discord

[15-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] see? üòÉ

[15-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] jojo has a picture, not new to Discord. Just new to **this** Discord.

[15-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Big difference.

[15-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[caex#1831] is it correct for digging?

[15-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] I know that the prize is small but I want to try

[15-Jul-18 01:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] no bots, friends of mine from the LomoStar app. I just explained everything I know about Komodo and Chainzilla

[Bo#8264] @Deleted User they will be coming to this Discord

[15-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] lol, no problem, they will not be confused with sock puppet accounts.

[15-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] good

[15-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I better figure out how to add a picture to my profile

[15-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] On mobile it's easy

[15-Jul-18 01:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] I cannot take part in the airdrop anymore because I banned accounts, and someone could come and say that I do it to benefit myself. Well.. it was fun. Good luck to you, guys. I'll be watching just in case.

[15-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[15-Jul-18 04:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We arw negotiation a more official partnership with NEM so I suspect this will increase the size of the community too

[yorklab#7270] Just now reading more ChainZilla material. I really like the direction this is going. Business oriented, setting it up to meet Govt Regs, getting real-world business involved. Setting it up for a great chance at becoming very successful .

[15-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] chainzilla and similar companies/projects are invaluable for Komodo ecosystem. komodo is the foundation and now it's getting ready for stuff being built on top of it

[15-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @siu is doing a nice job with his cainmakers project also

[15-Jul-18 04:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I agree about Siu's Chainmakers; they have already helped a few customers, and I'm sure they have more. Any third part project that can help Komodo grow works for me.
