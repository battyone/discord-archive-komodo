[jr.trump#1045] I have sent a ticket to support to ask them to let me deposit Zilla and this is their answer: "Steve Harris (DigitalPrice Exchange Support)

Aug 10, 21:39 EEST

Hi,

We are waiting for a response from Zilla team, they have released an update but they need to contact us before we update their wallet, therefore in the meantime we keep it disabled.

Regards
Steve"

[twittler#0062] Hi all

[11-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] I have a question

[11-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] Will i also be able to join the airdrop when holding kmd on ledger wallet?

[11-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] You'd have to export the privatekey of the address on the ledger that held the 500 KMD and above

[11-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] But theoretically it will be included. We are going to work hard towards a ledger compatible wallet in the future so exporting the privatekeys might not be necessary if you wait long enough

[11-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] Hm i might just get the kmd wallet then. Or just keep the airdrop waiting for ledger support. Still few days ro decide. Thx for the answer :)

[11-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[JP#5218] Presume you move from ledger to kmd wallet on the 14th, put them back on the ledger on the 16th. Then check kmd wallet on the 30th?

[11-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] Im conidering it :) thx

[11-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[12-Aug-18 12:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If you want an airdrop you need to wait for us to announce it in the #deleted-channel channel

[12-Aug-18 12:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @ThanakonJakkam that's an ETH address. We are a Komodo Independent Chain so you need the Komodo wallet

[crypto9999#3411] Hey is it kmd lite or kmd native wallet that supports airdrop?

[12-Aug-18 04:24 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Either is fine

[12-Aug-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If you're using native make sure that you have the latest wallet

[12-Aug-18 01:42 PM] Shinsoo#0021

[12-Aug-18 04:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[ChoCrypto#0878] So once I send my KMD to AGAMA wallet there is nothing b more to do? I just wait for automatic airdrop?

[12-Aug-18 04:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] @Unknown That's right

[12-Aug-18 04:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @Instel7 will need to import same address in chainzilla wallet to access them though righ ?

[12-Aug-18 04:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] KMD/Zilla Address is the same

[12-Aug-18 04:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] yea but wallet shows diff address when i start or am i wrong :p not sure

[12-Aug-18 04:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] You are using agama?

[12-Aug-18 04:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] yes

[12-Aug-18 04:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Make sure your on lite mode or native respective to your first startup

[12-Aug-18 04:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i am using native for both

[12-Aug-18 04:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] never used lite

[12-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If you use litemode, and then use native it will show different addresses. Also, native creates change addresses, if you look in the receive tab you will see all the addresses that your wallet has generated

[12-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i am syncing wallet right now will check n let you know

[12-Aug-18 04:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] but i did import kmd address earlier i remember as i wasnt seeing it

[12-Aug-18 04:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] make sure you're on the latest wallet too from artifacts.supernet.org/latest

[12-Aug-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] 2.41b is latest right ?

[12-Aug-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] yes

[12-Aug-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] ok i am on latest then

[12-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

Trying a nice targeted tweet about that coincodex article. I tagged ADA, RPX, and KMD along with Zilla, hopefully it gets some attention from the other communities (because they like their coins in it) and by extension get some fresh eyes on KMD and ZILLA ðŸ˜„
