[mo7881#6408] Will Zilla develop the underlying infrastructure?  or everything down to the custom application.

[20-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[mo7881#6408] ie app, website with the underlying blockchain

[20-Jul-18 07:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Herman most likely because that's where I was when I created the account.

[grim_chiefer#6001] Trying to sell Zilla on Hyper but whether I‚Äôm trying to buy or sell it just times out at 3/5. So I‚Äôll only post this one time - if anyone is wanting to buy some extra Zilla just PM me. Hyperdex just isn‚Äôt working out for what I‚Äôm trying to do cause it‚Äôs not finishing the transaction

[20-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] How many u wonna sell? Price?

[20-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] How much you wanna buy?

[20-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I've got 7

[20-Jul-18 10:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Sell you for 100 kmd

[20-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] That would be 150$ right now? I guess I wait for ICO in Jan then, where 1 Zilla = 0.45$. But thanks for ur offer.

[20-Jul-18 10:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Yeah ico is best bet to het zilla at good price.. also participate to airdrops..
So... ico zilla to get with kmd i guess :)

[20-Jul-18 11:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Ok officially done trying to sell on Hyperdex - post my sell listing - then error 9999 so cant buy or sell . And it‚Äôs the current version

[20-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Not enough volume i guess..

[20-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Guess not. All my buy orders lock up too so guess it‚Äôs hodl for the time being.

[20-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Lock up happens till orders are filled... need a counterpart to swap with.

[20-Jul-18 11:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Yeah but I‚Äôm buying from the broadcast sell orders and it still locks up. I get to 3/5 and then it freezes and eventually cancels the order.

[20-Jul-18 11:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] All good though - would think it would let me at least keep sell orders up though for others that want to buy.

[tolken#2655] ‚ÄúIt appeared that someone created multiple addresses collected a lot of .1 Zilla and then attempted to sell over 300 I believe here on Discord‚Äù hah. Crossed my mind, but I‚Äôm too lazy and I like these guys. Hopefully the faucet recovered after being violated.

[21-Jul-18 02:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] Maybe I‚Äôll go violate the pizza faucet.

[21-Jul-18 02:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That was some days ago.

[21-Jul-18 02:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The faucet has been offline while we make upgrades

[21-Jul-18 02:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Although, after the violation. The might never be the same. üòê

[21-Jul-18 02:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're working on our referal dashboard too. So discord airdrops and the faucet will be changed

[21-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
