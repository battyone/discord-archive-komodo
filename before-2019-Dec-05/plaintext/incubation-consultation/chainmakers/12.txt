Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw
The app link is located at : https://app.barterlly.io
We are open to suggestions, and partnerships.

See you soon !

Barterlly's team

i think 1% is too much fee huh? should be 0.1% and after 1year or so 1% cuz i think there will be more people out there who will join if there is lower fee

[30-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Oszy#5734
considering the $ amount it took to develop barterlly without any public community funding i say it's fair for now. there were huge costs to make it legal as well.

[07-Jul-19 05:49 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Where do you enter the seed in chameleon pay?

[13-Jul-19 12:33 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Hello, I was wondering how much it costs to set up an average Smart Chain? Also, do I pay for it to be set up in KMD? Thanks

[13-Jul-19 12:44 PM] gcharang#6833
@BitcoinTony123 
to setup the smartchains by yourself, there is no cost: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/creating-asset-chains.html

to have the process in the above doc done  automatically, along with various services, we have a blockchain builder coming soon (web portal and aws managed vps used to create the chains), will also have spv servers, explorers etc., - yet to launch, prices to be announced
^^^ all the above can be done as DIY by a capable developer

To add dPoW, there are additional costs

atleast 365 KMD + 365 coin to be notarized + integration costs

[13-Jul-19 12:47 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Great thanks! is this atleast 365 KMD + 365 coin to be notarized a 1 time payment?

[13-Jul-19 12:47 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
and do you have any estimates on how much integration costs are?

[13-Jul-19 12:47 PM] gcharang#6833
365 KMD + 365 coin - per year

[13-Jul-19 12:49 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Great

[13-Jul-19 12:50 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Do you have any estimates on how much integration costs are?

[13-Jul-19 12:50 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Sorry for my persistance, I just want to get it right

[13-Jul-19 12:50 PM] gcharang#6833
will let you know in a moment, just asked in internal chat

[13-Jul-19 12:53 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
ok thanks!

[13-Jul-19 01:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@BitcoinTony123 
the prices are not public currently
but  its currently several thousand dollars for a smart chain (i.e., a chain created using Komodo)

for an external chain that is  a BTC fork, there are additional costs of adding the dPoW code to their coin and a security audit
prices will be made public with the auto blockchain builder coming soon

[13-Jul-19 01:19 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Great, final question, Is this only payable in KMD?

[13-Jul-19 01:32 PM] gcharang#6833
365 KMD + 365 coin in their respective coins
integration costs: I think BTC and KMD will be accepted, other forms of payment not sure

[13-Jul-19 05:26 PM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Ok thanks for the help

How many coins are supported?

[04-Oct-19 03:29 AM] jspook16#3059
@siu - Chainmakers does chainswap use the same liquidity that atomicdex uses? There seems to be less on chainswap

[04-Oct-19 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
same liquidity as on atomicdex mobile

[04-Oct-19 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
you just see less on chainswap, because you can't see all the orders

[04-Oct-19 08:19 AM] jorian#4555
right now supported

[22-Oct-19 10:26 AM] gcharang#6833
@jorian can the chainswap desktop app unlock funds stuck when using the hyperDEX app?

[22-Oct-19 10:27 AM] Oszy#5734
@gcharang are you trying to get that guy's DEX back?

[22-Oct-19 10:27 AM] gcharang#6833
yup

[22-Oct-19 10:28 AM] Oszy#5734
if you could get him to have curl and sha256 his seed (userpass) it can be done in 1 command whilst running hyperdex

[22-Oct-19 10:28 AM] Oszy#5734
It's how i done it with chainswap before

[22-Oct-19 10:29 AM] gcharang#6833
do you know if the latest hyperDEX release has mm2 with `recover_funds_of_swap` ?

[22-Oct-19 10:30 AM] Oszy#5734
now that's what i am afraid of that it might not

[22-Oct-19 10:30 AM] gcharang#6833
I'll check

[22-Oct-19 10:31 AM] Oszy#5734
but there is no unlock funds button in the chainswap gui  to answer you question i only seen it in atomicdex so far

[22-Oct-19 10:32 AM] gcharang#6833
thanks for that, I guess building mm2 is the way to go for him

[22-Oct-19 10:33 AM] Oszy#5734
IF he's willing to sure.

[22-Oct-19 10:35 AM] gcharang#6833
do the both apps use the same data directory?

even if they don't ,if chainswap app has the mm2 with the `recover_funds_of_swap` api, the curl method might work
I will try with chainswap first

[22-Oct-19 10:36 AM] Oszy#5734
not sure i didn't use hyperdex on the same machine, they're both in appdata/local/programs on win

[22-Oct-19 10:37 AM] Oszy#5734
both has the mm2.exe in the folder

[22-Oct-19 10:38 AM] Oszy#5734
maybe he could overwrite HD binary with Chainswap binary and launch HD with updated mm

[22-Oct-19 10:40 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, will try all the options

so the mm2 instance started by chainswap uses sha256 of seed words as userpass?

[22-Oct-19 10:41 AM] Oszy#5734
Yes
`function userpass(passphrase) {
  const pp = new Buffer(passphrase, 'utf8');
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(pp).digest('hex');
}`
