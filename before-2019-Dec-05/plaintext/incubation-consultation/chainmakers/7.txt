No more forking fights! - go back to your corners

you should be pissed too

[18-Oct-18 04:43 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Why dafuq "should" anyone be pissed? Did you really think james made the feken contract, put it on the public git, and it was *solely* for STAKED and no one would ever use it? Really?

[18-Oct-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he told us that we couldnt use it

it needed to changes to be be ready for production ... its fine if this chain wasnt added to notary nodes... just a test chain... no problem

[18-Oct-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can use dice on any AC it doesnt need a new chain... Im confused as hell.

[18-Oct-18 04:45 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
ffs if I give you the 14 cents it takes to notarize it, will you stfu about nns?

[18-Oct-18 04:47 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
You're really confused as to why #chainmakers made a chain? 游뗷

[18-Oct-18 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the dice CC should not be used for any big money bets, there is a known 51% vuln

[18-Oct-18 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a cool demo and if KMDICE leads to an improved dice2 CC and GUI that is a good thing

[18-Oct-18 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but do not imagine the dice CC in its current state is ready for production usage

[18-Oct-18 04:56 AM] jl777c#5810
an assetchain kind of has an automatic path to being dPoW and a chain without dPoW just feels like not even a testchain, but having dPoW doesnt mean the chain itself is ready for casino level usage.

[18-Oct-18 04:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool... I should post this part on twitter thread too.

Following this warning, I will not take this new assetchain seriously yet. So, at least I'll be just watching it from sideline. It's cool thing, but I'll stay away from mining/buying it yet. Let's see how things turns out. 游뱂
Twitter

[18-Oct-18 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Keep it CPU mineable so people can all play nice and easily and we will make progress.... if everyone starts thinking the coins have value people will start hoarding them and not testing anything ... thats the oppsite of what this chain was made for.

[18-Oct-18 05:08 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
How's hoarding them any different than someone suffering from PMS and locking up the contract with txes? 游뱂

[18-Oct-18 05:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I was going to suggest KMDICETEST -

[18-Oct-18 05:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Because mining them or buying them was out of the question

[18-Oct-18 05:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
But then again - I now have an advance order for miners - and was considering buying some just because of the fever

[18-Oct-18 05:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Creating a dice GUI was something i had on my list, but given my limited out of work hours and the inherent issues with 51% and withdrawl, I left it alone after knocking up the TUI. Far down my list now, if at all. Much more interested in implementing LBS via oracles now.

[18-Oct-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181 (pinned)
```From my testing on DICEv1 anyone looking to improve it needs to start with the following:
1) Show if the contract has entropy TX in diceinfo 
2) Have a table end parameter on table creation, where the dice contract expires and the funds can be withdrawn by the creator
3) Figure some solution to scale, a single table can only take so many parallell bets before it just stops working. 
4) Make a GUI to make it easier for people to play```

[18-Oct-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In that order

[18-Oct-18 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the 51% problem is low chances with close enough dPoW freq... we were gfong to try and notarise the chain with just 2 blocks, this could also be solved, by having a single miner, like I have done with STREAMER chain, and have all coins mined out of the faucet.

[18-Oct-18 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or if you want to bet wirh real money, use a sister chain, where coins are mined/ bought and MoMoM migrate them to the DICE chain to play dice.

[18-Oct-18 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is a good roadmap here! I think this is bounty worthy to have blackjok3r as adviser/chainkiller

[18-Oct-18 05:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
And may deserve it's own channel?

[18-Oct-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already have a lot of work

[18-Oct-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[18-Oct-18 05:27 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
If it's killed to provide actual help and assistance, that's cool
if, on the other hand, it's killed because someone has sand in their lady bits, that's a different ballgame

[18-Oct-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shut up genie :trollface:  The issue has been solved its in the past...

[18-Oct-18 05:28 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think it needs a new channel purely for that project - not chain making or staking

dPOW DICE should become a "product" of SuperNET

[18-Oct-18 05:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Looks like everyone wants it

[18-Oct-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dice is for now the coolest CC that people can use ... its addicting but it needs work. It seems a great community project, here you all have a mineable test chain. Get to work ! :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 08:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok... this seems to be out of hand

[18-Oct-18 08:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We did this to have a public chain people can use to try dice and get some people from the community pumped to make a gui

[18-Oct-18 08:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We have no interest in withdrawing the funds locked, that is why we put 50% of the supply in the contract. Just to see what happens

[18-Oct-18 08:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If more coins end up locked or if all the coins are withdrawn we dont know and that is kind of the purpose.

[18-Oct-18 08:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We didnt get any funding for this or separated any coins for funding... it was just an idea that grew in itself too fast.

[18-Oct-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
kind of like PIRATE

[18-Oct-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
what happens is unknown, but kudos for doing it

[18-Oct-18 08:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Regarding this being your idea and that someone stopped you, i dont know, i have not been following staked much.

[18-Oct-18 08:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I do agree with you that this should not be given much value and it should be more about usage. Get people to try dice and play it.

[18-Oct-18 08:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It was added to the NN to be able to make it public... i dont see what the issue is here

[18-Oct-18 08:24 AM] jorian#4555
Pinned a message.

[18-Oct-18 08:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
As you say, anyone can do a dice contract in any assetchain so you can do your own. The purpose of this one is to exclusively use it for dice game only and locking most of the coins for this sole purpose.

[18-Oct-18 08:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also if it was james who said it was not production ready wjat made you stop, the difference here is that we didnt ask james.

[18-Oct-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers since there is now a task list to fix the dice cc, figure out the bounty

[18-Oct-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and may be ask forkwitch if interested to work on that

[18-Oct-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
as per the conversation seen witch must be able to do this task

[18-Oct-18 09:01 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok... we can work this out

[18-Oct-18 09:01 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i guess this is the purpose of the chain, to get these fixes going.

[18-Oct-18 09:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep 游뗵

why ? you havent even fixed anything yet :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will pay a bounty of 1000 KMD to the person who can get amount of entropy TX showing in dice info

[18-Oct-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
just do CCutxo and count

[18-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
currently it shows in CC EVAL ... the point of that bounty is to get that info to come back as return JSON

[18-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than STD out

[18-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this helps EVERY CC

[18-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A LOT!

[18-Oct-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1000 kmd is a lot for me... but not much to others... maybe someone can increase it 游땔

[18-Oct-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you want a GUI you NEED a return json with error messages that are not abiguous... there is no point making a GUI that cannot report errors.

[18-Oct-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everyone will hate it

[18-Oct-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the bounty should then be for a fixing/adding of proper error reporting to CC rpc, that would be something for @dukeleto

[18-Oct-18 09:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@dukeleto surely is sleeping

[18-Oct-18 09:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[18-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is the first step to be able to use CC for anything useful ...

[18-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need CC_EVAL to retunr data to NOT STDOUT ...

[18-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
somwhere it can be accessed by RPC calls

[18-Oct-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
duke added JSON errors, but they dont differentiate as to what the problem was .. just that it didnt work... the data was not avalible to him to to that.

[18-Oct-18 09:20 AM] Alright#0419
Can I have a tl;dr of what's going on here? Trying to skim through the ~500 messages is no fun

[18-Oct-18 09:20 AM] Alright#0419
just a new chain focused on dice?

[18-Oct-18 09:20 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[18-Oct-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they made a mineable chain and put half the supply into a single dice CC with 7 entropy TX 游땍

[18-Oct-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will turn out well

[18-Oct-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419

[18-Oct-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
what difference does that make to you

[18-Oct-18 09:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
jorian and i came to the idea that putting a chain solely to the purpose of dice game with 50% of supply on the dice contract might attract people
