staked has strayed from it's original stated purpose *a lot*

[18-Oct-18 09:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Understood. But i think that STAKED was also for overall testing

[18-Oct-18 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no coins lost

[18-Oct-18 09:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This chain is for a specific purpose.

[18-Oct-18 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
staked is the only chain that can have opt-in contracts rather than compulsory consensus rules

[18-Oct-18 09:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If the issues get fixed it might have a valuable future

[18-Oct-18 09:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Alright dont get me wrong, what you guys are doing is magnificent.

[18-Oct-18 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can always dowhat we did on early stakeds... is the issues get fixed snapshot and airdrop the chain to a new one

[18-Oct-18 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
but yes, this would have been the perfect usecase for staked üòõ

nothing is lost ... PIRATE thatcouldnt happen duse to Z address

[18-Oct-18 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
as if there was a problem, just kill the chain, change the contract, snapshot/airdrop

[18-Oct-18 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
and we're back at it

[18-Oct-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see whay they cant do that here ?

[18-Oct-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but ther is no reason to kill it yet

[18-Oct-18 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
Oh yep

[18-Oct-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that can be sorted later

they can mine all they like... and cant lose anything if the chain gets broken.

[18-Oct-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you snapshot and airdrop you an get the funds out of the contract too,

[18-Oct-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and do it better way second time.

we didn't see that yesterday

[18-Oct-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was never finished ...

[18-Oct-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I think for a single dice contract its solid

[18-Oct-18 09:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We think that eventually house edge and all the goodies should be added the dice contracts

[18-Oct-18 09:46 AM] Alright#0419
like withdraw? :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only way your going to be able to change ther contract is with snapshot and airdrop

[18-Oct-18 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but at least that option is there

[18-Oct-18 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you dont screw everyone who mined already

[18-Oct-18 09:46 AM] Alright#0419
might not need to kill the chain

[18-Oct-18 09:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol, maybe something similar to withdraw, but a bit different

[18-Oct-18 09:46 AM] Alright#0419
can't add block height triggers to change the rules at a given time?

[18-Oct-18 09:47 AM] Alright#0419
if not, that's pretty bad

[18-Oct-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, dice CC purpose is to find all the features dice2 needs

[18-Oct-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
stop bets, followed by withdraw, house margin, etc

[18-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it is easier to solve a specific problem than to make a generalized enviroment

[18-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
both have their places in the spectrum

Hello everyone, we will be doing an airdrop of 75% of Chainmakers funds this december. This means that CHAIN notary nodes voters will get a holiday's present from Chainmakers! üéâ  The snapshot for the airdrop will be done on Friday, December 14, 2018. So users can have some time to put their CHAIN in a accessible wallet. The actual airdrop we hope to be able to do it during the weekend. We will let you know when all is ready. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

[10-Dec-18 09:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so taking into account that total funds is 35,265 KMD, the total airdrop will be of 26,448.75KMD

[10-Dec-18 09:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
to 900,000 CHAIN

[10-Dec-18 09:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
since we wont include the Chainmakers development funds addresses.

[10-Dec-18 09:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so about 0.03KMD per CHAIN

[10-Dec-18 09:27 PM] Gleb#9356
So i can withdraw my coin from exchange to wallet???

[10-Dec-18 09:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, you need to in order to get the airdrop.

[10-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so just hold kmd and you will get a airdrop of CHAIN?

[10-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Buddz1993#5380
in the latest agama wallet?

[10-Dec-18 09:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no, the contrary. if you hold CHAIN, you will get KMD

[10-Dec-18 09:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ahhh cool

[10-Dec-18 09:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380

Hello

[11-Dec-18 10:21 AM] stock999#4818
@siu - Chainmakers  Have you a step by step instruction how to get the airdrop?  I'm a newbie here, so i need  more details.

[11-Dec-18 10:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You just need to hold CHAIN in a address you hold, preferably in agama.

[11-Dec-18 10:40 AM] stock999#4818
@siu - Chainmakers  I have agama.   It should be  1 CHAIN = 0.03KMD, as i see above, right?

[11-Dec-18 10:41 AM] jorian#4555
1 CHAIN will get approx 0.03 KMD yes

[11-Dec-18 11:08 AM] Oszy#5734

@Oszy should be fixed

[11-Dec-18 11:23 AM] stock999#4818
I never have used digitalprice exchange . Do they require KYC as mandatory?

[11-Dec-18 11:24 AM] Oszy#5734
No.

[11-Dec-18 11:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nope

[11-Dec-18 11:24 AM] Oszy#5734
Limit is 5K a day

[11-Dec-18 11:26 AM] stock999#4818
It's  nice to hear.  Because  i hate any form of KYC in crypto

[11-Dec-18 11:28 AM] stock999#4818
But  the order book on Digitalprice breaks any hope.

[11-Dec-18 11:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Chain supply is only 999,999

[11-Dec-18 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So its very scarce

[11-Dec-18 11:32 AM] stock999#4818
the ask price is 0.5 KMD, but the best bid is 0,001 KMD only, i.e x500, and there is no history yet, i.e no trades

[11-Dec-18 11:34 AM] stock999#4818
Is there any another exchange?
