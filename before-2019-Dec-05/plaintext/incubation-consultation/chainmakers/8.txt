we didnt do a tweet storm

[18-Oct-18 09:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we have just announced it here because of "fair mining"

[18-Oct-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
satinder did then retreacted it ... its ok

[18-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
there's a lot of work to do for dice, more people interested in it is good

[18-Oct-18 09:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if we told the NN and didnt tell the public then people wold bash us for giving privilege to some people over other

[18-Oct-18 09:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, that is what i figured. If we have a chain for the sole purpose of it, we could get some progress

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not really my concern... just things like this can look ad on all of KMD everythings alrady been cleared up, get interest and try to fix it, then maybe it goes somewhere.

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
what happened to other half of premine?

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] jorian#4555
100% of premine is in fund

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] jorian#4555
other half of supply is free to mine

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1 dice table right üòÇ

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
consider it gone

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its being mined... with btc halving schedule

[18-Oct-18 09:24 AM] jorian#4555
hence the 115k difficulty

[18-Oct-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
Ah

[18-Oct-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
by "supply" I thought you meant ac_supply

[18-Oct-18 09:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah... we did 10.5m ac_supply

[18-Oct-18 09:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then the rest mined up to 21m

[18-Oct-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you do realise that the entire supply will just end up in the DICE table ?

[18-Oct-18 09:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@blackjok3r why consider it gone? afaik it might not be useful for many bets at the same time now, but the game is playable

[18-Oct-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant get it out

[18-Oct-18 09:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wouldnt that make it not probably fair?

[18-Oct-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the odds mean, that the table gets all coins ... we tested this A LOT!

[18-Oct-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thousands of bets for days

[18-Oct-18 09:26 AM] Alright#0419
yea you're going to hit a problem

[18-Oct-18 09:27 AM] Alright#0419
entire supply will end up locked in dice fund eventually

[18-Oct-18 09:27 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, that is the end of the game then

[18-Oct-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
less supply more value for remaing coins :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not too late to fix it with a new chain with the right info ?

[18-Oct-18 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
We need to figure out how to cheat entropy

[18-Oct-18 09:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm... dont know

[18-Oct-18 09:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
with that kind of diff...

[18-Oct-18 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
so dice fund owner can cheat their own entropy and withdraw coins

[18-Oct-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless we engineer a new DICE fund and hardfork with a withdraw

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that requires the above posted issues to be fixed first

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
better use of premine would have been bounties for fixes of known issues

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but do we want to withdraw?, the initial idea is that we dont want to.

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] jorian#4555
but then funds lock up

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] jorian#4555
eventually

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] jorian#4555
unless someone is lucky enough to win

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the entire supply willjust end up in the dice fund

[18-Oct-18 09:29 AM] jorian#4555
but it seems this was tested a lot

[18-Oct-18 09:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it will take years for all funds to get locked up imo

[18-Oct-18 09:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the entire supply will take about 10 years to be mined

[18-Oct-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless someone get VERY lucky and never bets those coins ever again, or sells them to anyone

[18-Oct-18 09:30 AM] jorian#4555
house should have a faucet

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[18-Oct-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not a bad idea... wonder if you can do that

[18-Oct-18 09:31 AM] jorian#4555
but with 21,000,000 coins, a 0.1 faucet is kind of small

[18-Oct-18 09:31 AM] jorian#4555
it's giving kids in africa 10 cents

[18-Oct-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make the faucet mine super high difficulty ... so they cant just withdraw when ever

[18-Oct-18 09:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
10.5m to be exact...

[18-Oct-18 09:31 AM] SHossain#0007

@CHMEX

[18-Oct-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I dont think we made a tweet storm

[18-Oct-18 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
wasn't joking man, stop dragging it out

[18-Oct-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I made that tweet storm

[18-Oct-18 09:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We just announced the mining was available so that people didnt complain later

[18-Oct-18 09:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And we know that took off too soon

[18-Oct-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I did not do anything wrong.

[18-Oct-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Get over with that.

[18-Oct-18 09:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We should not be fighting over this. Please

no chain launch is perfect

[18-Oct-18 09:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes the explorers died for the moment

[18-Oct-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
what is important is not the moment of launch

[18-Oct-18 09:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
Need a more powerfull machine

[18-Oct-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but what happens during the life of the coin

[18-Oct-18 09:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
2 hours or so

[18-Oct-18 09:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, thank @CHMEX

[18-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jorian#4555
we have too many chains

KMDICE miners should put up bounties for the fixes

[18-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the world will have millions of chains in the future

[18-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
can put an additional explorer up if you guys want

[18-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jorian#4555
@siu - Chainmakers we should change our name to chainbreakers and do something abou it

managing this coming proliferation of chains will be important

[18-Oct-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can be your avdiser to break as many chains as you like

[18-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
we have forkwitch too

[18-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
you should team up

[18-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
he messaged me O.o

[18-Oct-18 09:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
My train of thought was that while people dont have anything at stake, motivation just doesnt manifest

[18-Oct-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he seems very smart

[18-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, just a bit of language issues on nuances

[18-Oct-18 09:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If we did a minable chain then some people will start to have something at stake and will have motivation to get the ball rolling

[18-Oct-18 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats a good thaught @siu - Chainmakers  we need people involved .. .staked was meant to accomplish just that ... but we hav been delayed for far too long

[18-Oct-18 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the advantage of staked, is you can just kill a chain if an issue like this happens...
