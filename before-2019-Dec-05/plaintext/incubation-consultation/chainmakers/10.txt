Nope

[11-Dec-18 11:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Like i said. Most CHAIN is held by our notary node voters and they dont seem to be interested im selling them

[11-Dec-18 11:41 AM] stock999#4818
Ok, clear.

[11-Dec-18 01:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[14-Dec-18 11:59 AM] Acura#2748
For the Airdrop i think

[14-Dec-18 12:07 PM] jorian#4555
yes, the airdrop. this file contains all addresses that are included in the airdrop. The threshold is 0.01 CHAIN

from the above json a couple of development addresses will be excluded

[14-Dec-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, who did you have to be or what did you have to have to be in the airdrop?

[14-Dec-18 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
airdrop of what to who

[14-Dec-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
of something to not-me ☹

[14-Dec-18 12:30 PM] jorian#4555

[14-Dec-18 12:30 PM] jorian#4555
you didn't mine enough 😛

[14-Dec-18 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
you guys considering moving CHAIN to assets contract once KMD has cc activated?

[14-Dec-18 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
just throwing the idea out there, we'll need someone to showcase it eventually

[14-Dec-18 02:17 PM] jorian#4555
@Alright care to explain that a bit?

[14-Dec-18 02:17 PM] jorian#4555
assets contract?

[14-Dec-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he means a token in komodo

[14-Dec-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
using tokens contract

[14-Dec-18 02:24 PM] jorian#4555
to do what exactly?

[14-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Alright#0419
not sure what CHAIN is exactly, but if it's solely for paying out KMD, seems a perfect fit for an on chain asset

[14-Dec-18 02:41 PM] jorian#4555
why?

[14-Dec-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
Why not? :trollface:

[14-Dec-18 02:43 PM] Alright#0419
but seriously, does it have any reason to be it's on chain if it could instead just be on KMD itself as a token

[14-Dec-18 02:43 PM] Alright#0419
this is all based on the assumption that it's only for payouts, not sure what else it does

[14-Dec-18 02:43 PM] jorian#4555
oh you mean as a token on KMD.. i thought on CHAIN

[14-Dec-18 02:43 PM] jorian#4555
ok, maybe that's a good idea

[14-Dec-18 02:44 PM] jorian#4555
unless james doesnt want us to contaminate the KMD

[14-Dec-18 02:44 PM] jorian#4555
maybe we make chainkitties

🤦🏽 

[14-Dec-18 02:45 PM] jorian#4555

[16-Dec-18 12:58 AM] cryptobankz#2642
Possible to mine Chain with Z9 ASIC?

[16-Dec-18 02:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, but only 0.0001 block rewards

[16-Dec-18 02:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Captain_Jack please DM me.

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@cryptobankz  1 CPU core is plenty to mine CHAIN; 1 ASIC is just pissing away $

[17-Dec-18 07:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
here We are glad to announce that the Chainmakers end-of-year gift has been airdropped... Enjoy!

Hello, what is chainmaker?

[18-Dec-18 08:59 AM] dokrates#8987
are those addresses in the txid random from all addresses?

[18-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jorian#4555
why random

[18-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jorian#4555
they are CHAIN holders

[18-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jorian#4555
read the channel topic and see https://chainmakers.co

[18-Dec-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why random
they are CHAIN holders`
Which means both are true :trollface:

[18-Dec-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The airdrop went to those random people that decided to own some CHAIN

[18-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that decided to support chain in their campaign for notary nodes 😃

[24-Dec-18 03:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
@siu - Chainmakers is `bagZ4Zu9mEcV3cwEtzUxdCfjvp8xAZbQBf` a vanity address or did you just get lucky? 😆
