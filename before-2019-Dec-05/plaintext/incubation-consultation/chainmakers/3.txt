tbt, I'm having network issues and mining nothing, but figured I'd toss my :trollface: into the convo 😛

[17-Oct-18 09:07 PM] crumb#2550
so using KMDICE for poker is not as good/convenient/possible as CHIPS?

[17-Oct-18 09:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If there is no house edge then in theory the losses are only tx fees? @WayneDingo

[17-Oct-18 09:08 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Need a brown sheet

[17-Oct-18 09:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@crumb for kmdice I assume every move is a tx, which is not the case when using lightning

[17-Oct-18 09:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The bet is just a other type of tx for KMDICE

[17-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Playing poker become expensive if every move from every player at the table is a tx

[17-Oct-18 09:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Only that in a CC address

[17-Oct-18 09:09 PM] WayneDingo#1455
Is this one of those provably fair random number generator deals where you bet a token and 3 numbers spin to the high or low?

[17-Oct-18 09:09 PM] jorian#4555
you can't play poker with KMDICE

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] jorian#4555
it is very simple: bet an amount at some odds; the higher the odds, the higher the payout if you win

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] crumb#2550
makes sense @Cryptoon, thanks for info

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is betting against odds, that is basically it.

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] crumb#2550
thanks @jorian

[17-Oct-18 09:11 PM] WayneDingo#1455
Sounds like the coinpot multiplier lol

That would be a 1.5million prize

Its a start @WayneDingo

[17-Oct-18 09:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And as there is no edge for the house who cares

[17-Oct-18 09:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its to have some fun

[17-Oct-18 09:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its just for fun, there is no actual profit for us from the game

[17-Oct-18 09:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[17-Oct-18 09:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[17-Oct-18 09:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
-Setgenerate true n? Or that is cpu?

[17-Oct-18 09:38 PM] Oszy#5734

[17-Oct-18 09:38 PM] Oszy#5734
