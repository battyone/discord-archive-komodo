well, I know it's not chain stall, mining node has picked up nearly 120 blocks in that 13 hrs

[11-Dec-18 08:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`seennotary.everyoneBUT21` :trollface:

[11-Dec-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That print can be removed I guess now lol.. the issue it was there to address is 100% fixed.

[11-Dec-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I need to add all my RPCs to help ... they have their own help, but there is no referance to them anywhere.

[11-Dec-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to know how to access the help for them.

[11-Dec-18 08:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Does this seem normal for staked?`du -sk ~/* | sort -n` ```3372404 /home/trist/staked```

[11-Dec-18 08:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Or is that quite large?

[11-Dec-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes pretty much... it has the entire `komodo` folder inside it

[11-Dec-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than in ~/komodo

[11-Dec-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  complained about it

[11-Dec-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you siad you have 8GB of swap ?

[11-Dec-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe try some less ?

[11-Dec-18 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeh, on this one.

[11-Dec-18 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sux cuz I dun wha?

[11-Dec-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
these chains are getting a little big for test chains... I think maybe we should just make a new cluster

[11-Dec-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its fine... at some point we need the staked foldes to be self contained

[11-Dec-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the staked repo does that because you asked for it

[11-Dec-18 08:42 AM] Mylo#8306
What does kmdlabs think about a pastebin AC for use in future dev efforts?

[11-Dec-18 08:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only thing of the sort I recall saying is that in bin dir notkomodod and komodod shouldn't both be called `komodod`

[11-Dec-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats depends on how profitable noary nodes are lol

[11-Dec-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we have plenty of space avalibel

[11-Dec-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to store such thigns

[11-Dec-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but Aluight and now CrisF are beoth having issues runnign out of space.

[11-Dec-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I avoided this, butnjust suing my main net notary server ... its full of cheap consumer SSDs

[11-Dec-18 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
@Mylo  What would the pastebin ac do?

[11-Dec-18 08:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Just be a pastebin?

[11-Dec-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sounds like an oracle chain

[11-Dec-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright did propose this before

[11-Dec-18 08:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Wondering if it is siilar to the `logs & stats` cahin?

[11-Dec-18 08:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is not to blame for space issues over suggesting that there should be two 14MB files with different names instead of overwriting each other_

[11-Dec-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Space issues are not your fault.. I didnt say that ... MOVING the ~/komodo folder to ~/staked/StakedModo

[11-Dec-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt use any more space... unless you install jl777/komodo along side it

[11-Dec-18 08:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[11-Dec-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF 
Check inside `~/.komodo` see if there are old chains you cna wipe

[11-Dec-18 08:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```genie@StakedNotary:~/StakedNotary$ cd ../.komodo
genie@StakedNotary:~/.komodo$ find . -name debug.log -exec truncate -s 0 '{}' \;```
_bets that_ 👆🏽 _would clear out a ton of space_

[11-Dec-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ... since libscott worked on out code base.. the debug.log is crazy big

[11-Dec-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he dumped everything to debug.log rather than stdout like james does.

[11-Dec-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can probably try to start removing all those usless prints

[11-Dec-18 08:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even "normal" daemons build out a shit ton after time

[11-Dec-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught that it started removing things at the top after some certain time / size?

[11-Dec-18 08:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only if you add the switch to do so, "default" is to append indefinitely

{Reactions}
👍 

[11-Dec-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool i'll look for this switch and make it default 😄

[11-Dec-18 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
along with removing all the tx details being dumped to debug.log, it should save a fairly large amount of space.

[11-Dec-18 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`-shrinkdebugfile` is what bitcoin uses (to auto truncate with each new run), dunno if we have that or not

{Reactions}
shexy 

[11-Dec-18 08:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`-printtoconsole` also works if you **really** want to save space :trollface:

[11-Dec-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nar the log prints too much, and until I can find all these prints and remove ones we dont need, that would be bad ... also notary nodes pipe to /dev/null by default, so debug.log is the only way to get any meaningful info when things go wrong.

[11-Dec-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`void ShrinkDebugFile()`

[11-Dec-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have ti btw

[11-Dec-18 08:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so debug.log is the only way to get any meaningful info when things go wrong.`
Yeah, that's why I added the :trollface:, because that leaves 0 log

[11-Dec-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems if called on daemon start already though

[11-Dec-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only thing I cna add, is to call it periodically during runtime... to prune it down... not sure thats a super great idea.

[11-Dec-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
talking about 30-40mb over all chains ... not that much..

[11-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Mylo#8306
Plain old pastebin chain, yes.  But if you’ve got better things to do that isn’t a hard dapp.  It is limited use but reusable base for a tutorial for any similar tool

[11-Dec-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright was proposing an ORL chain for these exact reasons ... I think mostly it was because if the name 😆

[11-Dec-18 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no more proposing anything until you figure out why I'm not notarizing CFEK :trollface:

[11-Dec-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do a wallet reset

[11-Dec-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if that deosnt work/fix it then resync the chain

[11-Dec-18 11:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
added `getlastsegidstakes_rpc` to https://github.com/smk762/Dragonhound/blob/master/getconf.py
there's a couple for oracles added earlier too, might want to merge? If so, I can copy it over to the right repo and submit a PR

https://thenextweb.com/politics/2018/12/10/australias-horrific-new-encryption-law-likely-to-obliterate-its-tech-scene/

"Australia‘s government signed a bill into law last week giving law enforcement agencies the right to force technology companies to reveal users’ encrypted messages. Another way of putting it: Australia‘s tech scene will soon be located on the Wayback Machine." 

Funny. More sad than funny, but just added another reason form me to move to Canada.

Australians are getting a lump of coal from the government for Christmas this year thanks to a new encryption law that could destroy the tech sector there.

we're too laid back for that. Normally thats a good thing, but the gov is far from laid back

SHossain is notarizing like 99% of the time 🤔

[11-Dec-18 05:36 PM] jorian#4555
who signs a notarization? i think it's the node that signs a tx last

[11-Dec-18 05:36 PM] jorian#4555
not sure how many sigs are needed for kmdlabs

[11-Dec-18 05:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one thing I'm entirely certain of:
being the 1st to see new blocks is meaningless

[11-Dec-18 05:41 PM] jorian#4555
in a notarization?

[11-Dec-18 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
in the official notaries, you clearly have an advantage if you have a clean wallet. i think it's the speed in which your node can present a valid input to a notarization transaction that makes the difference

[11-Dec-18 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ya, my NN was the 1st node in the network besides my mining node to see new blocks for most of that 4 hrs

[11-Dec-18 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
i don't think mining has a lot to do with notarizations

[11-Dec-18 05:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what I mean is that there's no "advantage" to being the 1st NN to know about the blocks

[11-Dec-18 05:43 PM] jorian#4555
apart from being the first, no, there is no advantage
