M pretty sure u will be fine jus glancing st C/C++ book, if u understand utxo management u are already there

although I think most of my knowlege has come from breaking my notary node contsntly, and the work on the scale test.

[09-Oct-18 02:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Agree

[09-Oct-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked is just expanding on that to a high degree now... I thank alright for having the idea, its be awesome so far.

[09-Oct-18 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Indeed 😃😍👍

having almost unlimited time was the single only way I was able to learn this much in a single year

I must spend 10-15h a day on this crap most of the time 😂

I used to be a nice guy, then I got like that, and look at how I turned out :trollface:

I figured out of all the skils to learn, this one has the best future demand for jobs, as nobody know how to do it

And my trade is mechanic, which will usually always be needed if anything bad was to happen, I can get work doing that.

[09-Oct-18 03:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, anyone with the passion to learn coding at a useful level only has their future capped by their willingness to do so and apply it 😉

the thig is old cars need parts, which normally cost more than the car is worth...

[09-Oct-18 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so unless its so dangerous its going to kill you and you cannot get another car, dont spend any money on it

[09-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I sold all my cars last year... still have my 4wd in the shed, lucky I had a few lucky payouts  *pirate* lol to keep it regoed, but at somepoint I need to get it on the road and sell it aswell.

figure the reduced cost of petrol will cover the cost of the loan, then I can get another ute in a couple years

very good mechanics learn debugging quickly, which is key to coding

[09-Oct-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
or I should say I spend half my time debugging

[09-Oct-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so once you can debug, you are halfway there.

[09-Oct-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if to choose, better to be able to debug well and code not so good, than the other way around

{Reactions}
👆🏼 (3) 

[09-Oct-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the reason is the debugging will provide feedback about the code so a good debugger evolves naturally in to a better coder

[09-Oct-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and basically it is impossible to code something that is bugfree, though it is possible to code in a way that has significantly less bugs

[09-Oct-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it is by reducing the entropy of the codebase. make it so that if you are doing something in one place and then instead of copy paste, to make a function that does it and use that function in all places. Remove all redundancy from the code. I dont follow this 100% myself, but I should

[09-Oct-18 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I try to do this, unless I cant figure out how to... There is one change I want to make in staked/komodo that I have been thinking about for a while, its now it chooses `I_AM_NOTARY` and also the ac_private exception.... it uses a static array, but it should use the current array of notary keys instead, otherswise it constantly needs to be changed when we do an era change. I guess this would also help you for komodo elections.

[09-Oct-18 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but there must be a way to do it... obviously its not super simple or you would have done it already.

[09-Oct-18 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
both use the elected_notaries1[] array, dont they?

[09-Oct-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[09-Oct-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we have 4 and probably will be some silly number after not long as alright wants to change notary keys like every mont or somthing silly.

[09-Oct-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have made functions to return the arrays via timestamp pf blocks

[09-Oct-18 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but block time stamp isnt always avalible in the code

[09-Oct-18 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like the I AM NOTARY is set at start, befor eany blocks are loaded... I guess in this case it could use local time, and then call an update somehwere possibley... pac-private exception, possibly can be done with the funtions I already have, but as we are not going to use those chains I havent worried about it and juts hard coded it to notaris_staked[] for the tests we needed to do there/.

[09-Oct-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is a new testchain, you can just overwrite the elected notaries arrrays, only if you want to be able to validate the chain using different notaries at different blocks do you need all.

[09-Oct-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
at some point we will need hashtables of all the pubkeys and their active era

youve mentioned those before, before I go making it more complicated aI guess I should do some readin up on those

[09-Oct-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
its almost like magic. and so simple to. arbitrary number of entries, constant time to search for things

[09-Oct-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  There is an update to iguana in jl777 branch and blackjokr3 branch. I am thinking I may move us to blackjok3r branch soon but this is not something htat `start.sh` will do on its own. I have been running it for plenty of time, and its stable and working a lot better than before.

[09-Oct-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you are free to use which ever branch you like.

It is for just running A chain in assetchains.json

[09-Oct-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for testing purpose.. it also build correct branches etc and updates daemon on chain start

[09-Oct-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no doubt has bugs just threw it together. starting on clean install in an empty user on a test VM on my server

First chain I will do is STAKEDTROLL for our chat ..

[09-Oct-18 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have the STAKEDTROLL chain working just about perfect. Finding al the random prints wasnt easy but stdout is now just a chat box. We have an immutable chat secured by bitcoins hash rate 😮

just needs some simple scripts or a GUI and can be used .

[09-Oct-18 06:48 PM] jspook16#3059
@blackjok3r I'll take a look at your staked troll this weekend. Progress 😀

[10-Oct-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔 woke up with an idea, not sure if its worth pursuing though, on STAKEDTROLL make it so that at only TX with OPRETURN are allowed.. So you can only faucetget and KV... This makes is almost impossible for someone to force mine empty blocks. Dont think I need to do it at this stage, but I like the idea.

[10-Oct-18 02:46 AM] jspook16#3059
Yeah that's a good idea. I was thinking maybe oracles to database usernames and passwords?

[10-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah using KV is very simple, and was an easy solution.

[10-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but there is no doubt a much better way to do it, with CC's

[10-Oct-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to get like a group of people all trying to use the TROLL box at the same time really, to see what happens... like will it even work etc.

[10-Oct-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I managed to get multiple messages per block working too, just required removing all debug prints that it was printing beore, and now on block confirm they all show up at once.

[10-Oct-18 03:57 AM] Mylo#8306
So this can be used in barterdex as a troll box ?

[10-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Mylo#8306
Will see if anyone in #cc-gui wants a crack at it.  I’ll update js rpc lib to do kv.  Nice write as required js lib.

[10-Oct-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It might be able to..

[10-Oct-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It kind of requires a full node

[10-Oct-18 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe the app could use our notary nodes in some way to send and fetch messages

[10-Oct-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although there is nothing stopping us airdroping the chain every time it gets over 200MB or something... not sure how long that would take exactly its has very fast blocks if pople are using it, but they are ondemand.

[10-Oct-18 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need a group of at least 10 people to all try and use it at once... I will write some scripts this afternoon so that its nice and simple to send messages
