yes it was making a needless blocks

[06-Dec-18 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
do we know if migrates work reliably now?

[06-Dec-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They appear too .. but things keep getting changed that break everything else

[06-Dec-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its been hard to test it

my entire income comes from creating needless blocks 😛

The origional problem appears to be 100% fixed

[06-Dec-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even if chains are stalling for hours at a time

[06-Dec-18 11:24 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
My latest set of migrates seem to be OK (random log check) - but only integer values <500 used so far.

[06-Dec-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as  long aswhen the export tx happens the import happens 100% of the time. the problem with migrates is fixed

[06-Dec-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there could still be other issues that cause them to fail

[06-Dec-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But the funds can always be recovered

[06-Dec-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that is great news!

[06-Dec-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
is it a big pull request?

[06-Dec-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would have the check it ... I dont think so.

[06-Dec-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
From memory its a comment of a break;

[06-Dec-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and a merge from libscotts repo

[06-Dec-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The only errors reported by these other guys have been unrealteed to the import fail problem we set out to fix.

[06-Dec-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will make the PR now for you. Just finished fixing the logs up...

[06-Dec-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
I am pretty sure these are the 3 fixes you need. I submitted one as a seperate PR as it flips vout locations... Please check that one carefully. Everything on our chains works with that change, bit I recall him saying ti was a hard forking change.

ALso in iguana you need to enable MoMoM specifically for the chains you want to notarise... Or just enable it for everything.

[06-Dec-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That should be all of it ... but my guess is you will need to test it

[06-Dec-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not easy to do... as you need main net notaries to run a cluster of chains 😂

[06-Dec-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
1028 would hardfork only existing usage of import/export so it seems safe

[06-Dec-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
since this works now, it seems time to enable it for all chains, so i will remove the is_STAKED call in iguana

[06-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if your SuperNET fork will have that, but that is the line required to activate it

[06-Dec-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  I managed to get rid of just the IPv6 errors in debug.log without disabling them all. Also the seeds are no longer loaded for `is_STAKED` chains everythign is in master branch. We are now ready to launch an `ac_period` chain to test that.

[06-Dec-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will leave that to you, and work on my dev env here to stop making hundreds of "fix" and "try" commits 😂

[06-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
ac_period works as expected

[06-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
still need to pentest it a bit

[06-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
try to fudge the amounts in different scenarios

[06-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r you need to make it affect magic value

[06-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
same magic/ports with or without it

[06-Dec-18 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah it wonyt load a chain with the wrong value though

[06-Dec-18 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will see if i can figure that out

[06-Dec-18 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just doing something else ...

[06-Dec-18 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wallet problem is unfixable ... its the actual wallet code... as a hacky work around, I disabled rescan for non-critical walletDB errors for staked chains, and change slightly how disconnect tip works... Hopefully it works well.

[06-Dec-18 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Now in dissconecttip the wallet is called to scan every tx and see it if they exist on chain, and then removes any orphaned txs plus the staking tx.

Notarizations stopped for me.  now restarting.

[08-Dec-18 12:23 AM] CrisF#3405
No notarizations due to no KMD :abusedsmily:

[08-Dec-18 12:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, is everyone notarizing `DUCKS` without trouble?

LOL what a day here... wife sent us out to buy a cubby house 100km from here in the middle of nowhere. We got there and it was totally broken, and refused to buy it.. On way back car blew a radiator hose and cooked itself. Got a lift back to town with a bus full of old dudes on the way to a game of bowls.

[08-Dec-18 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The ute was towing a car trailer, and then ended up being towed on it 😂

[08-Dec-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So likley I will be unavalibe soon for a while, need to replace the dudes engine 😦

@TonyL do you mind trying `-connect=80.240.17.222` with a fresh sync?

[08-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
like delete ~/.komodo/CFEKLAMEDUCKS entirely

[08-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
then sync without StakedNotary scripts

[08-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Alright#0419
my nodes on latest master seem to just be hanging when I try that, but I don't think anything changed that would make that happen
