I can add in code than on app start it will start daemon automatically, set pubkey, ensure that it synced and etc

@TonyL if it's using flask, why not use flask security package?

I think it's expected

[02-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Alright#0419
it's a visualization of the "diff wall" caused by pos64 I believe

[02-Jun-19 02:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I noticed some big gaps between blocks and then lots of blocks close together, was tryna figure out wtf.
51% staked helps tho

please add
```
myscriptDir="$( cd "$(dirname "$0")" ; pwd -P )"
cd $myscriptDir
```or something similar to the new stats file; I would do a PR, but internet sucks ass

ok so I spent a good chunk of the day doing this docker thing

[02-Jun-19 03:05 AM] Alright#0419
have it set up to where I can launch a new container with a single command, but I'm definitely going to need some help with the nginx side of things

[02-Jun-19 03:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
probably gonna try and get auth sorted today

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator On ubuntu that script change fails, Change to

[02-Jun-19 06:26 AM] at#4177
ok just found some comments from jl777 on other channel responding about it not giving up will try couple more things

[02-Jun-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright https://dash.plot.ly/authentication dash have nice (it looks simple to use at least)auth module


At first install this dep: 
```pip3 install dash-auth==1.2.0
import dash_auth
```

Then add to code:
```
VALID_USERNAME_PASSWORD_PAIRS = [
    ['parsed_username_from_config_file', 'parsed_password_from_config_file']
]```
Then add before layout:
```auth = dash_auth.BasicAuth(
    app,
    VALID_USERNAME_PASSWORD_PAIRS
)```

[02-Jun-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
So you can just create (pregenerate with pseudo RNG lets say) config.ini on your docker instances with app and share username/password to users alongside with IP

[02-Jun-19 07:36 AM] TonyL#3577
OAuth they have as well, so possible to create some permissioned accounts

[02-Jun-19 07:37 AM] TonyL#3577
It might be interesting: for example you can give one user permissions to check trades history only, other is your portfolio manager so you can give him permissions to open positions and etc

[02-Jun-19 08:25 AM] TonyL#3577

@blackjok3r - staked github repo needs some TLC - I think you have made changes to the listassetchainparams.py in the stakednotary repo that have not been copied across??

[02-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Oszy#5734
Can I buy 4 LABS from someone? don't want go to exchange for this, i need to double my utxo's for staking.

[02-Jun-19 10:21 AM] jorian#4555
you can get them for free from me

[02-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Oszy#5734
which has bigger impact on staking, the size of UTXO's or the UTXO count per segid?

[02-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jorian#4555
游땐

[02-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Oszy#5734
wat 游땏

[02-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a 64way battle

[02-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jorian#4555
one of the two is correct 游땥

[02-Jun-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
first segid gets 2 second advantage over the next segid

[02-Jun-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so 126 second advantage over last segid

[02-Jun-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
size * coinage can cross the 2 seconds

[02-Jun-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so you are directly competing with all the other utxo in your segid

[02-Jun-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
and at a handicap with half the supply or advantage, depending on your position (on average)

[02-Jun-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
true answer requires deeply analyzing all utxo, by segid and their age

[02-Jun-19 10:33 AM] Oszy#5734
I see. Thank you!

[02-Jun-19 10:39 AM] jorian#4555
so size does matter. i see some people having a script that merges the just mined LABS with the utxo that mined it

[02-Jun-19 10:41 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yes, the `staker.py` script does that

[02-Jun-19 10:41 AM] jorian#4555

[02-Jun-19 10:48 AM] jorian#4555
why is that so high?

[02-Jun-19 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
is it because of verushash?

[02-Jun-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
verushash goes a lot faster, all diff numbers are much bigger

[02-Jun-19 12:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Been more than 4 hours without a block on `CFEKFEK` according to stats.

is there a version of pos64staker that works?
I keep getting `takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given` on like everything I tried with the TUI

[02-Jun-19 12:47 PM] jorian#4555
i've seen that before

[02-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[02-Jun-19 12:47 PM] jorian#4555
and i bailed on pos64staker

[02-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Oszy#5734
in  TUIstaker.py change  (chain, rpc_connection) to just (rpc_connection)

[02-Jun-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
