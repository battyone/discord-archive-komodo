Its important that it works, or ppl are just going to stop updateing

[01-Mar-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
sorry wait

[01-Mar-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
you need to do makecclib prior to that I believe?

[01-Mar-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make it build cclib in build.sh but its failing.

[01-Mar-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
please stop and let me fix it

[01-Mar-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will ping when its fixed

[01-Mar-19 09:13 AM] Alright#0419
I know what the problem is, I experienced this last night

[01-Mar-19 09:13 AM] Alright#0419
on a fresh clone, you can do `./makecclib` then `build.sh` just fine

[01-Mar-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is that cclib needs to be built first... but the depends are not there yet...

[01-Mar-19 09:13 AM] Alright#0419
but after that `makecclib` itself doesn't seem to create cclib.so

[01-Mar-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should work... but it needs that wallet include hardcoded to where the depends are. AJames made me revert the hardcodeed path for the merge upsteam and now I cant find the commit that changed it to change it back.

[01-Mar-19 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
so you must do 
```
cd ~/komodo/src/cc
./makecclib
cd ..
make
../zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

[01-Mar-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes build.sh can do that though

[01-Mar-19 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
but doesn't?

[01-Mar-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont need ppl manually doing that...

[01-Mar-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for uaign 2 branches ... that need build.sh to build

[01-Mar-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start.sh needs to work

[01-Mar-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or the entire system will fail to work

[01-Mar-19 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
idk the error smk and CM posted is the same thing I was experiencing last night

[01-Mar-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and everything will need to be one branch again

[01-Mar-19 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
and it was because there was no cclib.so file

[01-Mar-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know what the problem is, my server is just fucking slow and testing a fix is very time consuming

[01-Mar-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think half the problem at the moment is GitHub its not propagaing commits... like some nodes are getting them and others are just not seeing any update... it throws everythign out of whack. I think we need to get off it soon, microsoft broke it good.

[01-Mar-19 09:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Would that make difficult for merges etc with KMD?  (if we were on gitlab or something and KMD was still on github)

[01-Mar-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I think so... Need someone that knows more to tell us the options we have, but ZatJum the other day took nearly 24H to be able to pull a comit from GitHub

[01-Mar-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was a commit with just one line cahnged to add a `;` I dont see why it would have got lost.

[01-Mar-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is working on my notary. I did `cd ~/StakedNotary/komodo/` then `rm -rf *` then git pull on StakedNotary then `start.sh`

[01-Mar-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its not pulling the newest commits its not going to work.

[01-Mar-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  Try again, if it didnt work for you the first time.

[01-Mar-19 09:30 AM] CrisF#3405
I was in the process of `start.sh` when one of the updates was pushed.  Started ok and immediately got a couple of notarizations. ``` git log -1
commit fda3e349607b4606dfc7f5acd1cd6eac819707c1 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: blackjok3r <blackjok3r@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Mar 1 16:28:55 2019 +0800

    fix update_komodo.sh with build.sh
```

[01-Mar-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there were many bugs with start.sh using build.sh.. they shoauld now be fixed. My notary just built master branch and CFEKDIMXY branch without error. then started all chains. Waiting 15mins for KMD to laod but it all looks working now here.

[01-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Master is ising `makerogue` and CFEKDIMXY is using `makecclib`

[01-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I think I finally got it working.

[01-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
takes a long time to get throgh the start process, but at least it works without throwing stupid errors now.

[01-Mar-19 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm really glad that is now sorted. That was going to be impossible to manage going forward needing everyone to manually build diffrent branches and copying komodod's around the place... asking for trouble.. 
I also found the problem with MoMoM.. there are null MoMoM hashes on the target chain. Now I just need to work out why they are null.

wow that pretty cool... wonder what makes that happen just updraft?

[01-Mar-19 09:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if conditions are right and its hot enough, it can create localised weather systems. Fire science is pretty interesting

Whirling Flames: How Fire Tornadoes Work
California's wildfires have spawned a number of dramatic fire whirls, also known as fire devils, fire tornadoes or "firenadoes." What is a fire tornado, and how dangerous are they?

When does the season wind down around your way?

[01-Mar-19 09:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
on call ends in april, but it burns all year round. Mostly not near where anyone lives, and during managable weather

[01-Mar-19 09:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
between april and september we start half the fires, just so there's not much to burn once summer hits

[01-Mar-19 09:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Still a bit to go then.

[01-Mar-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure I know how to fix MoMoM here... wont be too long until I know what to do.. It seems that it can call MoMoM data when there is no data avalible yet. Might take a while to work out how to force it to always returna  result. but I'm sure its possible .

[01-Mar-19 10:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got the same help human error again. building zcutil now

[01-Mar-19 10:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Last git pull seems to have worked here. Start.sh ran OK.

[01-Mar-19 10:16 AM] jorian#4555
yeah here too, aborting msgs all over the place

[01-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jorian#4555

[01-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jorian#4555
that CFEKDIMXY folder is empty

[01-Mar-19 10:19 AM] jorian#4555
but that makes sense if the build fails

[01-Mar-19 10:19 AM] jorian#4555
purged everything (again) and rebuilding

[01-Mar-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the fucking cclib shit ... it seems to build sometimes and not otehrs... it really really needs to be fixed, as it basicaly broke this entire project.

[01-Mar-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
`make`

[01-Mar-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no, I used make before

[01-Mar-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt work at all, you need to use build.sh now just to build somethin or it just fails isntantly almost...

[01-Mar-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The two branches here, even have diffren deps ... its a very not ideal siituation but if we can get it working with these branches... then it will work for anything

[01-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
```cd ~/komodo/src/cc
./makecclib
cd ..
make
../zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

[01-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
this seems to work for me every time

[01-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
I've been using it for building while testing dilithium

[01-Mar-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hwo can you call make without a makefile... that make 0 sense?

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the build.sh makes the makefile

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant make, with the old makefile

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after you switched branches

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
a fresh clone you can just do makecclib then build.sh

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the issue isnt getting it to build

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
otherwise must do the above commands

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its getting it to build, AFTER yuou have just built a diffren branch with a diffrent makefile setup

[01-Mar-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
at least that's my experience

[01-Mar-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The issue will we the hardcoded berkleyDB header file... some nodes might have BerkelyDB installed and it may get confused what one to use.

[01-Mar-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If it constantly doesnt work, even after a fresh clone... Then we need to try something else//.

[01-Mar-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There will be a solution to this.

[01-Mar-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We require one

[01-Mar-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cant use multiple branches and need everyone to build them and copy them manually... people make mistakes

[01-Mar-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and that takes too much time.

[01-Mar-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
msot wont bother to do it

[01-Mar-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
if the commands I posted do work, is there a problem with just adding them to start.sh?

[01-Mar-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can you try to manually build the 2 branches in a way that works 100% of the time on multiple systems, if youc an do that I will replicate it in build.sh and start.sh

[01-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
```
cd ~/komodo/src/cc
./makecclib
cd ..
make
../zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

[01-Mar-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise I will just keep trying random shit until everyone can build it

[01-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
this

[01-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
works for me every time

[01-Mar-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when you switch from master to CFEKDIMXY branch that works 100% of the time?

[01-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
sec

[01-Mar-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
master uses makerogue, and DIMXY uses makecclib

[01-Mar-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is what we need to get working.

[01-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
why does master need makerogue?

[01-Mar-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just waht it uses by default

[01-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
a chain will launch without libcc.so, but it will not validate CC spends for the CCs
