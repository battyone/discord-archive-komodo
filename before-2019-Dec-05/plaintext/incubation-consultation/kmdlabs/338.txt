is what you need to be looking at lol

[19-Mar-19 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the validation is there

[19-Mar-19 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless it never does it

[19-Mar-19 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
yes I understand what I was getting wrong there

[19-Mar-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have to test that to see it follwos that path I guess

[19-Mar-19 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
it's simply rebuilding the OP_RET from target without knowing it fully

[19-Mar-19 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
Maybe man, idk I have like 8 files open right now trying to look at this

[19-Mar-19 04:15 AM] Alright#0419

anything to do with imports will blow up your brain as it is ... and he made it 100x more complicated by adding stuff to it

[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
not the best person to pick apart the code itself, I need to produce burn txs then look at them afterwards

[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes wait till chains up and try to break it good

[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I can see all imports are passing eval->import

[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
whcih is validatiing MoM and MoMoM proofs

[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you cant invent tokens or coins

[19-Mar-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
master is equal with FSM + ac_nk

[19-Mar-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and builds

[19-Mar-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
whenever your ready fire up a 2 chain cluster.

[19-Mar-19 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
params?

[19-Mar-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just do DIMXY5/6 I guess... I was going to try some PoS chains to test migrates ... but tbh I dont think we can break them with the new code ... nmo unless we stoip notariszations for more than 1 day

[19-Mar-19 04:19 AM] Alright#0419
ok, I'll start building latest, going out for a smoke while I wait then I'll start them up when I'm back

[19-Mar-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries

[19-Mar-19 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
this is truly our last hurdle to jump over before launch

[19-Mar-19 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
I think if people were to find bugs in this now, they could claim a bounty and be the first to get one

[19-Mar-19 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
just saying.......... all that matters is the notaries agree it's fair and that it's below the weekly limit

[19-Mar-19 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. I think a bounty CC is actully easy as pie but we can pay it any way we need to until that is ready

[19-Mar-19 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I might not even need to use a new CC tbh

[19-Mar-19 04:24 AM] Alright#0419

@LabsAssistant Please do `./start.sh`, we added 2 new chains to test non-fungible token imports

[19-Mar-19 05:38 AM] dimxy#2587
@Alright  migrate_createburntransaction add the full token creation tx (from the src chain) to the burn tx opret,
then migrate_createimporttransaction constructs new token opret for the dest chain plus it adds the complete burn tx to the import tx opret. So the opret is going to grow even more than we consider it above üòÄ

[19-Mar-19 05:41 AM] dimxy#2587
We need this to validate the source token params on the dest chain

[19-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant sorry, I had a typo in parameters. Please do it again

I am going to work on the transaction size shortly.

[19-Mar-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know what to do. I just didnt have time this morning

[19-Mar-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKORKL appears to be staleld aswell whoever is staking that.. 
I beleive I just fixed the `staked` repo also. Testing it in a minute

[19-Mar-19 05:49 AM] dimxy#2587
@Alright  it should go to eval::ImportCoin too when an import tx is added to block

[19-Mar-19 05:51 AM] Alright#0419
Understood, thank you. Why does funcid 'c' for tokens eval code always return true?

[19-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Alright#0419
Could I not just create a transaction with 'c' funcid to avoid it being validated?

[19-Mar-19 06:02 AM] dimxy#2587
actually it should return invalid for funcid='c'. We should not be here as token creation tx should not go over validation  code as it does not have cc inputs (only normal inputs).
We get into the token validation code when token is being spent (that is when funcid = 't')

{Reactions}
üëç 

[19-Mar-19 06:03 AM] dimxy#2587
if we get here for 'c' it means incorrect funcid

[19-Mar-19 06:03 AM] dimxy#2587
i'll correct this, thanks

[19-Mar-19 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm looks liek some RPC outputs are changed so the migrate script probably doesnt work now. Thats ok, I will fix it. The manual process is easier now, to see what is what. Instead fo just dumping raw hexes

[19-Mar-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@dimxy  The old burns are not compatible

[19-Mar-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So is is safe to diable all those code paths?

[19-Mar-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still waiting on notarizations to test a new migrate

[19-Mar-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maight have fixed the issue I found

[19-Mar-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the call for compete import tx was only using the new import path

[19-Mar-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is going to take a bit longer to test than I imagined lucky I started on it now

[19-Mar-19 09:18 AM] dimxy#2587
Sorry about the changed rpc. I just noticed there were complains in this chat about unnamed outputs and named them

[19-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its fine

[19-Mar-19 09:19 AM] dimxy#2587
forgot to warn you

[19-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im cool with that change

[19-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just trying to wrap my head around how to workou thtese size contraints and my old export were not working

[19-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I fixed by adding UNMARSHAL OLD into complete export step

[19-Mar-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is working now

[19-Mar-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not even the OPreturn in burn tx that needs to be cosntrained

[19-Mar-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the total op_retunr in the import so I need to work backwards I think

[19-Mar-19 09:23 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, the import tx opret is the largest in size and accepts burn tx, proof and its own opret

[19-Mar-19 09:24 AM] dimxy#2587
i'm writing the doc for migration rpc, I think we might describe possible considerations for opret and its compartments sizes

[19-Mar-19 09:26 AM] dimxy#2587
so you are getting into the oversized opret?
is this because of many vins added to the burn tx?

[19-Mar-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it could be many things. I need to go fromt he import tx op_return and work backwards to see what steps add what sizes of data and what is fixed and what is variable

[19-Mar-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then we can constrin the variiables on the burn tx to hopefully prevent someone exporting more than can be imported

[19-Mar-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think there is target and source assetchain name, which we can know size off... then there are the MoM hash and the payouts (should be fixed)

[19-Mar-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then MoMoM hash on KMD should be rfixed

[19-Mar-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
leaves the burn tx itself and the token payload

[19-Mar-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This sucks. ... the amoutn added on KMD isnt even static

[19-Mar-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This will be an extremly hard problem to solve

[19-Mar-19 09:47 AM] dimxy#2587
maybe we could divide import tx  into several transactions and have just references on them in the import tx?

[19-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems extremly complicated

[19-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to know exactly by what % or fixed size the burn tx is increased by after its been burnt

[19-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and before its imported

[19-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and simpley prevent

[19-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the user making a tx that big

[19-Mar-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If they need to do that, then yes, maybe the token can be split over multipl migrate transactions

[19-Mar-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but until we know excatly how much it increases by we dont know how big it can be

[19-Mar-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I added string length to the new RPC output here. Guess I will need to like plot the ouytput of a bunch of txns

[19-Mar-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see what rule it is following

[19-Mar-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully its a liner equation lol

[19-Mar-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
just add 30% (or something like that)

[19-Mar-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
keep it simple. if it doesnt fit with 30% to spare, then a different burn tx needs to be made

[19-Mar-19 10:56 AM] dimxy#2587
yes I was going to suggest 50% opret for the burn tx size, but seems 30-40% is better
We may also provide that it won't add small normal inputs to burn txns

[19-Mar-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I use a heuristic in utxo selection that most always works on the first pass. If the utxosize is < total/N, I skip it,where N is the max vins

[19-Mar-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
that way, it adjusts the utxos uses based on the total amount needed.

[19-Mar-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
there could be times where a more efficient utxo selection would work, but i think if it is possible to fund the payment, this algo will do it

[19-Mar-19 11:33 AM] dimxy#2587
now it is N=60 in the create burn transaction rpc (for coins), so it is better to have a lower value like 5-10

Wife had to have shoulder surgery so I became Mr Mom on top of inheriting 100+ markets of OS upgrades, updates and security audits.

[19-Mar-19 03:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
BUT!!! Saw the new RockPi with M.2 connection running Debian... about to get myself a dedicated Pi node for KMD lol

[19-Mar-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
@daemonfox you should talk to @radix42, she's been working on ARM builds of komodod lately

[19-Mar-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
at the moment, not sure it's possible to run a node on a ARM proc

[19-Mar-19 03:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
Good to know

[19-Mar-19 03:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill still be getting it with a bunch of accessories. It is the summer project I have planned for my 11 yr old this year.

[19-Mar-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
Build the Pi... make him learn to deploy it and then turn it into a node so we can both use it.

[19-Mar-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
He started editing his own videos this year and i didnt show him anything...

[19-Mar-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
so im going to give him a KMD node and some reading to do this summer see what he does with it

[19-Mar-19 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
good shit üòÅ start him off with some rogue

[19-Mar-19 03:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
exactly!

[19-Mar-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
and if he does take to it... he will stream and make videos for his YT channel I manage

[19-Mar-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
so ill tag the hell out of it
