If only he took more episodes to power up, I'd get home in time to stop him

[14-Oct-18 08:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@kmdkrazy tell him you mentioned it on a publicy accessible discord channel on clearnet, and now Homeland Security knows what he's up to. If he bought something darkhat, there's another breadcrumb for the NSA. If he does something silly, the goons will have him. If its purely "educational" like lock picking your own locks, thats ok. Not sure how you'd phish yourself though, or even want to if you could...

Ever stop to think maybe it was the customer being assessed for quality to determine what coaching they might require to maintain citizen slave status?

üòõ This would also explain why there was a thunderstorm around when he was gone. He created it.

@kmdkrazy plenty of money to be had in crypto for those paying attention

Does anyone here fancy CPU mining my test chain?

[14-Oct-18 11:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll give it a carck. need to confirm Pool is working

[14-Oct-18 11:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah, and pm'd

[14-Oct-18 11:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

Just using VCPU on it at the moment, didnt realise it wasn't part of assetchains.json.

[14-Oct-18 11:12 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Naa it is my own one I spawned

[14-Oct-18 11:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pool config runs from that, so if you get it added I can make it minable with nheq miner

[14-Oct-18 11:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I probably won't get it put on there, I won't have the chain up for long

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator haha, that is awesome!

Anyone know why as soon as someone connected to my chain the 'longestchain' went to 0
```"blocks": 511,
  "longestchain": 0,
  "timeoffset": 0,
  "tiptime": 1539515769,

`Mining when blockchain might not be in sync longest.501 vs 343`
if its just us mining, maybe I've 51%'d you

[14-Oct-18 11:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
As soon as you joined the chain mine went like that

[14-Oct-18 11:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
probably recover when I sync. not really sure

[14-Oct-18 11:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`Mining when blockchain might not be in sync longest.0 vs 534`

[14-Oct-18 11:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be cos not being notarised?

[14-Oct-18 11:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have no idea. But I can't seem to get my GPU's mining the chain. My pool shows the network stats fine, but my pool hash rate isn't getting picked up by the network stats. Nor am I getting any blocks found

[14-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
longrest chain can be unreliable on small networks

I need to update my logic on pool config for that

Did some research on parts for GPS rig, total cost about $340. Well down from the $1100 for the garmin pig dog collar.

If you're really interested in having a go at setting it up on a chain I have an odroid xu4 I can donate to the cause.

Getting it to you might be a hassle though.

yes @radix42  got KMD working on arm64 recently, if you want to fun the full blockchain on the device. Not sure how viable it would be down the track, maybe you can have an ondemand chain, just for this 1 contract, so that the chain doesnt grow in size very much, uses staked notaries to notarise it and its  secure.

[14-Oct-18 12:42 PM] radix42#3743
Has to be an arm64 v8 series processor tho

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator okay so.. for the dog image.. is it possible to click an image of your dog.. sitting or standing outside looking at something (not towards u). u know like starring into the void.. in deep thought? that would be a great picture to have a base to depict the artwork you need.

[14-Oct-18 12:56 PM] CryptAiz#8085
then we can perhaps also use the shadow.. or not.. but atleast that puts the dog in the scene.. thinking of flying away free.

[14-Oct-18 12:59 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah thats the other thought I had, like dream bubbles of being a dragon. I'm interested in what people come up with without me influencing the creative process too much, though I'm probably being too vague

[14-Oct-18 01:00 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've not really prepared for this lol. I'll need to think up the comp rules and timeline etc.

[14-Oct-18 01:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got a fair bit to do getting the device functional and transmitting, but will need to dig a bit deeper into oracles as well. Had a play last week maybe? Docs not so complete at the time. It was around about the next day that I lost my car and my dog, which leading to this idea

[14-Oct-18 01:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I"ll do a photoshoot with the hound next time the sun shines and I'm not engaged in indentured servitude. Will try and setup a crude 'greenscreen' backround too.
