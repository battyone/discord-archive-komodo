what's the start command to launch those 2 chains, as an observer?

[05-Jan-19 09:24 AM] Mylo#8306
and do i need to run the stakednotary repo version of komodo?

[05-Jan-19 09:25 AM] Mylo#8306
or can i do it with vanilla kmd?

[05-Jan-19 09:28 AM] CrisF#3405
I believe you need `staked`  --  https://github.com/StakedChain/staked  ```./startall.sh```or
`StakedNotary`  --  https://github.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary ```./start.sh```

Staked works I installed of earlier in my VM

[05-Jan-19 09:32 AM] Mylo#8306
i like how startall just fetches assetchains.json, makes managing it heaps easier

[05-Jan-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to fix the start.sh there tho u can't pass the daemon any flags on start, kind of annoying.

[05-Jan-19 09:32 AM] Mylo#8306
i just want it for oraclessamples, curious

[05-Jan-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool. Yeah if u just want to start the chains and sync them from stratch staked repo is the go

[05-Jan-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Right now everything oa master branch, however that will never be the case on mainnet

[05-Jan-19 09:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, mining node is running well on it.  No VM yet, haha.

[05-Jan-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm sure u will figure it out, I was lucky I had someone who builds data centres to guide me early on and teach me basics of virtualization, used VMware but still most of it applies everywhere

[05-Jan-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once u get it working its really easy

`StakedModo` 😄

[05-Jan-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think alright came up with that

[05-Jan-19 09:41 AM] Mylo#8306
wow kmd blocks take up just under 8GB now.  used to be 3

[05-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Anyone wants - been running proxmox for about 4 months now - pretty stable and fairly auto OOTB (unless you want to boot from anything other than the main drive)

[05-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Mylo#8306
do you know if manages openvz ?

[05-Jan-19 09:52 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
LXC is the native - not sure about OVZ (from containers anyway)

[05-Jan-19 09:52 AM] Mylo#8306
hmmm ok thanks

[05-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My server boots the esxi from a pair of mirrored sd cards... Then all the drives are on a hardware raid card. Wasn't hard to get VMware working on it. Although I remember how long it tool to set up, likely lose my notary node for a week to get it all going again.

[05-Jan-19 09:54 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I run the OS from a USB HDD - the built in installer refused to recognise it (wanted to go straight to the ISCSI) - so I installed Stretch and then APT'd proxmox over the top.

👌 

[05-Jan-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the SD cards are USB drives too , that's good to know thanks

[05-Jan-19 10:09 AM] Mylo#8306
what's the difference between kmdlabs.com and kmdlabs.io?

[05-Jan-19 10:10 AM] CrisF#3405
They are just different domains we have that will all point to the same site when completed.

[05-Jan-19 10:10 AM] CrisF#3405
The .io will be the main domain.

[05-Jan-19 10:10 AM] Mylo#8306
oh ok.  so ppl just writing stuff then some sort of agreement.

[05-Jan-19 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
.com is the place I practiced making a site on.

[05-Jan-19 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
There will be only one.

[05-Jan-19 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
They are the same content, but .com is just up to date.

[05-Jan-19 10:12 AM] CrisF#3405
.io was being made by a web designer.

[05-Jan-19 10:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Neither are finished.

#ThisChainHasTooManyDamnTransactions :trollface:

That's what clean wallet transactions is for

[05-Jan-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just because they exist on chain doesn't mean your wallet needs to know how much it has spent ;)

[05-Jan-19 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Really both could b a

[05-Jan-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because your RPC ports should be close to the internet

[05-Jan-19 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
rpcallow works wonders 😉

[05-Jan-19 10:55 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
IKR - but I couldn't be arsed to shut the daemons down first

[05-Jan-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is code in the streamer and also the chat dapp that pulls all the RPC creds from the local conf file if u port it in

[05-Jan-19 10:57 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
May look at that - after a figure out why waiting for confirmations jumps from 1 to 6

[05-Jan-19 10:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
are assets still confined to home dir?

[05-Jan-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Everything we use here assumes that everything is located inside .komodo

[05-Jan-19 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Confirms will stay at 1 until a notarisation has happened

[05-Jan-19 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not saying that
like in my komodo.conf, I use
`datadir=/mnt/Storage/CoinData/Komodo/`
can we do that with assets now, or are they still always need to be in .komodo?

[05-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
More than 1 confirm means that the tx can't be reorged

[05-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmm I think its fairly hardcoded into komodod that they need to be inside the same folder

[05-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is there any reason that needs to change that's important?

[05-Jan-19 11:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because I like having a data dir that isn't in home ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[05-Jan-19 11:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#security

[05-Jan-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So use a sym link

[05-Jan-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I've hady notary like that from say one... The chains are on their own drive

[05-Jan-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I'd my os dies... I didn't have to resync them all

[05-Jan-19 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's actually the main reason I started doing it

[05-Jan-19 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
/mnt/komodo_data -> ~/.komodo

[05-Jan-19 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Etc...

[05-Jan-19 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For each chain

[05-Jan-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also have a whole second node with all chains on an NFS mount.... So if chains die... I can just switch

[05-Jan-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Never had to use it 😂

[05-Jan-19 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
    kmdinfo=$(jq -cr '. | {blocks, connections, balance}' <<<$(komodo-cli getinfo))
    kmdlastntrztime=$(jq -r '[.[] | select((.address != null) and (.time != null) and (.address = "$kmdntrzaddr"))] | sort_by(.time) | last | (.time)' <<<$(komodo-cli listtransactions "" $txscanamount))
    printf "$format\n" "KMD" " " \
            "$(jq "[.[] | select(.amount==($utxoamt|tonumber))] | length" <<<$(komodo-cli listunspent))" \
            "$(jq .blocks <<<"${kmdinfo}")" \

What's the stdout say at the time of the connect inputs failed?

[05-Jan-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The fact the errors go to 2 diff places is something we may need to try and fix long term, but its not so easy

[05-Jan-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also if dh is doing oracles its possible its trying to double spend

[05-Jan-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to do some more investigation but my understanding of how CCS work, means that they can spend inputs out of order...

[05-Jan-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When spamming migrates, you will find that the stdout will spam momom-check-fail ... And the debug.log spams connect inputs failed... They r the same error, and mean nothing in that case, justeans u tried to import before the notarizations happened... Its because of the sledgehammer code.

[05-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When u spam a lot of oracles, they make txns that depend on your local mempool, and the way the mempool works, means that txns will try to propagate to other nodes that don't yet have the inputs they need to be valid.

[05-Jan-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once these txns are included in a block, they are put in every nodes mempool, so they can be validated out of order. I think its because making the miner need to place all txns in the block in the correct order is either too slow or too hard.

[05-Jan-19 12:11 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, I"ll test and report.

[05-Jan-19 12:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
been having issues with oracle creation, gets stuck on the step where waiting for it to show up in the oracleslist

[05-Jan-19 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the prior creation transactions seem to be fine, just does'nt finish

[05-Jan-19 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[06-Jan-19 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Mylo I know it works on komodod (for KMD), my question was does it also now work for assetchains
