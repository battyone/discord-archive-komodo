thank you for your help

[14-Jun-19 02:11 PM] zatJUM#9924
Is iguana port open? It's not the same one as NN

[14-Jun-19 02:12 PM] phm87#7395
i opened port 9333 as explained in the readme but I didn't check in the code

[14-Jun-19 02:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
good

[14-Jun-19 02:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
DNS port too?

[14-Jun-19 02:12 PM] phm87#7395
what is the DNS port ?

[14-Jun-19 02:12 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't p2p ports of KMD and AC

[14-Jun-19 02:13 PM] zatJUM#9924
53, but nothing would work if not opened, I presume

[14-Jun-19 02:13 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't know that port 53 should be opened

[14-Jun-19 02:13 PM] phm87#7395
interlally I think that port 7776 is used but I should not open it

[14-Jun-19 02:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
don't open rpc port!

[14-Jun-19 02:14 PM] phm87#7395
no no I won't, i'm not crazy

[14-Jun-19 02:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
I think DNS port has to be opened

[14-Jun-19 02:15 PM] zatJUM#9924
It's opened on my NN and on LABS

[14-Jun-19 02:15 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't open it on the NN2019testnet

{Reactions}
🤔 

[14-Jun-19 02:15 PM] phm87#7395
and I still opened nothing on the mainet NN because iguana port is not chosen yet I heard

[14-Jun-19 02:16 PM] phm87#7395
I mean that I didn't open the DNS port (53) on the NN2019testnet

[14-Jun-19 02:17 PM] zatJUM#9924
I understood!

[14-Jun-19 02:17 PM] zatJUM#9924
It just seems strange to me because I thaught it was mandatory

[14-Jun-19 02:17 PM] phm87#7395
but this 53 port is not mentioned in any of the readme

[14-Jun-19 02:17 PM] phm87#7395
then we should adapt readme maybe

[14-Jun-19 02:17 PM] zatJUM#9924
Don't remember where I've read about that

[14-Jun-19 02:18 PM] zatJUM#9924
If you had not opened it on testnet, then it's not!

[14-Jun-19 02:18 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[14-Jun-19 02:18 PM] phm87#7395
but I don't know for KMDLabs

[14-Jun-19 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my suggestion would be to turn ufw off, make sure it works, and then you know if it's a port issue

[14-Jun-19 02:19 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't install nor turned on ufw because I have a pfsense in front. I'll check if ufw is there and turned on but it should not

[14-Jun-19 02:19 PM] zatJUM#9924
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Is your 53 port open?

[14-Jun-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I got mine working and then dicked around with ports after

{Reactions}
💯 

[14-Jun-19 02:20 PM] phm87#7395
```sudo ufw status
Status: inactive``` (but it is normal that it is turned off because I have a firewall that can do the same things + more stuff)

[14-Jun-19 02:20 PM] zatJUM#9924
And does pfsense let things go as they should from the ports that need to be open?

{Reactions}
👆🏽 

[14-Jun-19 02:20 PM] phm87#7395
I configured the pfsense NAT and rule similarly to the 2019NNtestnet so I guess that it should be ok

[14-Jun-19 02:21 PM] zatJUM#9924
and 9333 port?

[14-Jun-19 02:21 PM] phm87#7395
dwy told me that for mainet, he'll help me to add rate limiting and other stuff into pfsense

[14-Jun-19 02:22 PM] phm87#7395
yes it is opened for TCP. I tested with TCP/UDP until yesterday. It should not matter, TCP is enough I think

{Reactions}
🤷 

[14-Jun-19 02:26 PM] zatJUM#9924
You just restarted all. Check from time to time if iguana is not dead (it is sometimes for my node), and let a few hours, should be enough to see if it works now

[14-Jun-19 02:27 PM] zatJUM#9924
can you ouput stats now please?

I have same heights

[14-Jun-19 02:29 PM] zatJUM#9924
Could you clean your KMD tx? 2275 is a big figure!

[14-Jun-19 02:29 PM] phm87#7395
I'll wait few hours and do it tonight to test. I though that 2275 was not too big

[14-Jun-19 02:30 PM] phm87#7395
Or do you prefer that I do it now ?

[14-Jun-19 02:30 PM] phm87#7395
oh I am stupid, I can use cleanwalletransactions I don't have do stop/start things

[14-Jun-19 02:30 PM] zatJUM#9924
I don't really know if it's big or not, but mine have much less

load is low so I don't think that hardware is a bottleneck here

[14-Jun-19 02:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
Why do you have so many komodod running?

[14-Jun-19 02:33 PM] phm87#7395
it is because the (vurtualized) cpu have 8 threads and I think that komodod creates threads

[14-Jun-19 02:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
Oh I have many too 😉

[14-Jun-19 02:35 PM] zatJUM#9924
Let's see in an hour or two

[14-Jun-19 02:35 PM] phm87#7395
I'm staring at iguanaTV but it won't help

[14-Jun-19 02:36 PM] zatJUM#9924
Do something else more productive while waiting 😉

[14-Jun-19 02:36 PM] zatJUM#9924
I think I'll swap my "SIZE" column with a "TXN" one

[14-Jun-19 02:37 PM] zatJUM#9924
Think it's more pertinent

[14-Jun-19 02:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
@zatJUM i do this daily now

[14-Jun-19 02:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
@phm87  Who did you get your script from?

[14-Jun-19 02:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
reset both KMD and LABS wallets

[14-Jun-19 02:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
I do it too, but I'd like to be sure cleanwallettransactions does its job fine for each coin in NN

I invented way to no longer need cleanwallet stuff.... but still testing.. maybe some day will merge it to labs for others to test

[14-Jun-19 03:01 PM] phm87#7395
as suggested by daemonfox, I stopped iguana, KMD and LABS, I created backups of wallet.dat that I deleted then I launched ./start.sh

[14-Jun-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
start.sh will imprt the key from block 0-

[14-Jun-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
bad days

[14-Jun-19 03:03 PM] phm87#7395
Before deleting wallets, I did a cleanwallettransactions before and in the ./stats I see 4 TXN (while I saw 2200+ TXN before cleanwallettransactions). Weird

[14-Jun-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seemas it will work after that t o me

[14-Jun-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null`

wait a few hours

[14-Jun-19 03:05 PM] phm87#7395
ok I'll wait but apart from cleanwallettransactions and create new wallet.dat I changed nothing. it is running since 19 days. metaphilibert helped me in private at the beginning

[14-Jun-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im sure we can work it out, eveyone just so busy atm, labs kind of on back burner until fork is finished

More utxo ...

[14-Jun-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the wallet only has iguan utxo and 1 other?
LABS uses my iguna by default it assumes many things, never merged it o jl777 repo because of this

[14-Jun-19 03:08 PM] phm87#7395
before I deleted wallet.dat LABS had 8 utxo

[14-Jun-19 03:09 PM] phm87#7395
see the conversation above where I sent output of ./stats : it was 8 before deletion of wallet.dat

[14-Jun-19 03:09 PM] zatJUM#9924
@phm87  Were they iguana utxos?

👆 

[14-Jun-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my iguana randomly chooses just 1 utxo until it get to the num,ber of utxos, it can make false negative if ther are lots of other utxos

🤔  so from last Athlon64 CPU cores to newest, you lose half the listunspent time with 1 utxo
