yes its CMarices node

[02-Apr-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its trying to spend spent utxos. Seems to be a problem with resyncing KMD with the key imported... after some amount of tx it gets corrupted and loses track of its shit.

[02-Apr-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
advantage to a new key, I guess I missed that fun

[02-Apr-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[02-Apr-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I added rescan from height to `importprivkey` so from now on... we can just resync with no key then import keys manually with only a 10,000 block scan.

[02-Apr-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should ahve done it ages ago took 15mins

[02-Apr-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[02-Apr-19 03:05 PM] CMaurice#1685
Gave wallet a go manually but didn't work `error code: -28
error message:
Loading block index...`

[02-Apr-19 03:07 PM] Alright#0419
KMD rescanning for like a day now 😭

[02-Apr-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dump the wallet and reimport with no scan 😛

[02-Apr-19 03:09 PM] CMaurice#1685
yep, doing no

[02-Apr-19 03:09 PM] CMaurice#1685
now

[02-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how?

[02-Apr-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
rm -rf wallet.dat

[02-Apr-19 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then what cris said

[02-Apr-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
what is 1280000 doing in that command

[02-Apr-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
rescans from there?

[02-Apr-19 03:26 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes.

[02-Apr-19 03:26 PM] CrisF#3405
I made it higher to make the deadline.

Just started to notarize, sorry for a delay

[03-Apr-19 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no problem man.

[03-Apr-19 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure if everyone is on the very latest.. but it should be ok. I will add another chain today in CFEKNK cluster

[03-Apr-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
While waiting for this chain to get to 200 notas. I am adding a function in iguana'scoinadd that will check each wallet to make sure all the utxos are unspent. This will prevent the issue that CrisF and CMaurice are having. 
With the new rescan it should be quite easy to fix the issue. So simply preventing iguana from notarizing if the wallet is full of spent utxos seems a reasonable solution.

[03-Apr-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks to @CrisF  giving me his deaded wallet.dat... I have an update to iguana ready to go. 
It now pulls a listunspent on each coin as it adds them then loops `gettxout` on each utxo. If there are utxos in the wallet that are spent iguana will just exit. 
This only prevents someone breaking notarizations by accident. But its better than not having it. Only calls on load, It lists all the spent utxo in the wallet then just exits. Requires manually fixing the issue with the height rescan I made yesterday. We will need some documentation for this so people know what to do. But it works fine.

Ok its working sweet @CMaurice  any chance you can update and tell me what happens? If you do any I'm not here DM me the result and ask CrisF about how to fix it.

[03-Apr-19 07:15 AM] CMaurice#1685
Starting now

[03-Apr-19 07:19 AM] CMaurice#1685
Got stuck at `[KMD] : Waiting for KMD daemon to start...`

[03-Apr-19 07:19 AM] CHMEX#0686
it will take a while to start

[03-Apr-19 07:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
maybe 5-10 minutes depending on the system

[03-Apr-19 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah mine takes nearly 15mins to start KMD

[03-Apr-19 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Apr-19 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you will need to scroll up quite a lot... when iguana exits it caues the scripts to error out like crazy.. Might need to fix that so they exit gracefully...

[03-Apr-19 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you need to just pastebin the whole thing.

[03-Apr-19 07:27 AM] CMaurice#1685
Seems to be up fine

[03-Apr-19 07:29 AM] CMaurice#1685
Not much in the way of activity though

[03-Apr-19 07:36 AM] CMaurice#1685
ticking along a bit, no notarisatioins yet

[03-Apr-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm really?

[03-Apr-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Your node was spamming spent utxos into the notarizations...

[03-Apr-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I loaded CrisFs wallet on my node and ran the new iguana and it exited saying the wallet had 82 spent utxo in it...

[03-Apr-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I messed it up when I cleaned the code up

[03-Apr-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Any chance you can log the ouptut of iguana and send it to me after starting?

[03-Apr-19 07:38 AM] CMaurice#1685
yep, having a look...

[03-Apr-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should be printing `[KMD] txid.(<atxid>) vout.(0) is spent` or something like that

[03-Apr-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just after adding the KMD coin

[03-Apr-19 07:44 AM] CMaurice#1685
can't see anything like that in debug.log

[03-Apr-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its in the iguana stdout

[03-Apr-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the terminal where you do start.sh

[03-Apr-19 07:47 AM] CMaurice#1685
nope, can't see "is spent" anywhere

[03-Apr-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ok... I wil monitor the -26 here and see if your node comes up again, if it does tere is another problem

[03-Apr-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maye you already fixed it...

[03-Apr-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If it keeps happenig I will need to make some kind of node banner that kick you 😆

[03-Apr-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`[KMD] : txid.(9b13b3c3dca20069506e361982d424f0ce3fe1864dfa0d5ddab0180ccd0cd6ba) vout.(16) is spent!`

[03-Apr-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is the exact output that Cris's wallet was generating

[03-Apr-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`[KMD] has 83 spent transactions in its wallet.dat, please fix this issue and restart.`

[03-Apr-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it prints this, and exits iguana... or it should... If the wallet is not full of spent tx then it starts as normal.

[03-Apr-19 08:00 AM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, no... can't see anything like that, but not notarising

[03-Apr-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant actually see any -26 for ages so I think whatever it was is fixed anyway.

[03-Apr-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry for false alarm. Thanks 😃

[03-Apr-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just would have liked to test that on another dead wallet to make sure... but i think its all good.

[03-Apr-19 08:02 AM] CMaurice#1685
no worries, I am sure my wallet will revert to corrupt when you're not looking

hahaha it only happens after a full resync I think

[03-Apr-19 08:04 AM] CMaurice#1685
welcome to the wallet, it's 150 megs tho

[03-Apr-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wow lol, Cris was 200MB

[03-Apr-19 08:04 AM] CMaurice#1685
ok good, reassuring 😃

[03-Apr-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats definatly the problem... and the RPC we use doesnt amke it smaller

[03-Apr-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just zeros out the space in the file

[03-Apr-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`total notary pay.19899999204` Its nearly there

[03-Apr-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181

The RPC is returning true again, so I cant see why not

[03-Apr-19 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is one way it can still notarize and that is is min sigs notaries comment out the check to the RPC from daemon... if this could be a problem it can be added as consensus rule to the chain that those nota are not valid.

[03-Apr-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess that should be tested. I will do it on the next chain, that I launch tomorrow
