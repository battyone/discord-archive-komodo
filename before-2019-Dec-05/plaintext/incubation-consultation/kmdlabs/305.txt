[21-Feb-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and mine is the same

[21-Feb-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have TonyL and CrisF Nabob, genie
all showing in this list, but tbh, I dont know how accurate that is.

[21-Feb-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not srue of tony knew about the tor stuff, meybe he just updated normally

Do I need to do anything with ufw?

no I doubt it... but you habenmt done the iptables comamdn I think?

[21-Feb-19 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
I did it, but will give it another go.

[21-Feb-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ufw cant make a rule for this, you need to go lower level to iptabls, thank Decker for the rule. it worked first time, his exampel he gave me.

[21-Feb-19 11:43 AM] CrisF#3405
hmm, maybe I didn't..

@Alright you can stop pinging me now

[21-Feb-19 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright I updated

[21-Feb-19 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright are you happy now?

[21-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hell tony was catching a plane

[21-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[21-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I still see CrisF's node and Tonys node here. @CrisF  try to restart. stop.sh and start.sh only should be enough. Might not have caught the redirect because of socket already being bound.

[21-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Nabob is still left, but one node shouldnt affect it too badly. Tony I dont think updated properly in his rush.

[21-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully hes not on that plane too long

[21-Feb-19 12:05 PM] SHossain#0007
do you see my node?

[21-Feb-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no yours appears to be "working" which is liek the oppisite in this case... It just turns out there is a print on node 0 (my node) that stops prinnting when using tor. So I cna see who has updated or not

[21-Feb-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im no longer in every notarisation tx I see. so something is working. Still 2 nodes not using tor though.

[21-Feb-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That means at least that 2 nodes on tor are participating, so its working.

[21-Feb-19 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405
That looking better?

[21-Feb-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  pushed `geterablockheights` RPC to master. 
It takes no args, and returns the following:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABSTH geterablockheights
{
  "era": block,
  "2": 2,
  "3": 2502,
  "4": 4001
}
```
These are fake timestamps I used to test it. for LABSTH it just returns:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABSTH geterablockheights
{
  "3": 1
}
```

[21-Feb-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
tyvm

[21-Feb-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries, 10 lines of code 😂

[21-Feb-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
preety sure a script would have taken ages and been very slow lol.

[21-Feb-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also with 2 nodes still not using tor, notariszations seem to have already become somewat unreliable

[21-Feb-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lookslike failed experiment 😦

[21-Feb-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
remind me again, why tor anyway?

[21-Feb-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was to remove location as a factor, it was alrights idea and was very easy to test

[21-Feb-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems the tor data is either just too slow to arrive and is lost, or never arrives

[21-Feb-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess it worked with some nodes not on tor and nodes on tor could sign, but maybe they were just signin last and the only node to submit tx. 🤷

[21-Feb-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like it needs a minimum of 3 nodes not suing tor to make notarizations, which means, that its not going to work.

[21-Feb-19 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, and this was something we discussed with PIRATE, the only way tor will work reliably is if there's a dedicated set of servers to pass through
in theory, that should apply with NNs being the "servers", but I think it would take more nodes than we have

[21-Feb-19 12:35 PM] CrisF#3405
No other networks already up that might be suitable?

[21-Feb-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught about making us all an exit point... but that has huge bandwidth and possible legal problems

[21-Feb-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is one way to make it possibly work in a similar way but use our own nodes... but I dont think it would do anything except slow down the network a lot... Ping the packets around with a counter, until it reaches some number then sending to the recipient... but really thinking about it, that wouldn't really work, as the nodes the furtherest away would still have the same disadvantage.

[21-Feb-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looks liek we are all buying a server in texas 😄

{Reactions}
🤠 

[21-Feb-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` as the nodes the furtherest away would still have the same disadvantage.`
in theory, that "should" dissipate over time as the routers learn paths, but in practice, I'm not sure

[21-Feb-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`looks liek we are all buying a server in texas`
I can put one in Sydney and get the same results I do now :troll:

[21-Feb-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doubtful. I mean at launch with 1 maybe 2 chains, we can put our nodes anywhere.. even all on my server 🤣  but thats not a great idea for the network as whole.

[21-Feb-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With the payment how it is, any ndoes down the bottom are just going to change loication to where ever the top ndoes are.. very quickly id imagine too.

[21-Feb-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well... @Alright  that failed.. Do we try and see why its not working by tracing apckets etc, or give up ?

[21-Feb-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can make it send liek 10 packets for every 1, but maybe there is something totally wrong

[21-Feb-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
recvmask is gone... qwe lost all connectivity 😦

[21-Feb-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`With the payment how it is, any ndoes down the bottom are just going to change loication to where ever the top ndoes are..`
what location are the bottoms? I'll set up a clean node close and test if I can do the same as now (after tor fixed/removed, of course)

[21-Feb-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well mine is in Perth WA, and it definatly ht lowest, that has been online. Alright is lower but has been down the entire time, so you cant count it.

[21-Feb-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the rest not sure, as I have IP's we can geolocate them and try see the distribution I guess...

[21-Feb-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But trying to balance regions.... is just making it unenforcable

[21-Feb-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like KMD main net which we did want to avoid. With such a small number of nodes, really we would just need to place them all on the same continent and be done with it.

[21-Feb-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not opposed to that, maybe even US and EU would be ok ifg half were on each.?

[21-Feb-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
just leave it, see what happens and we can revisit it if we must

[21-Feb-19 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
keeping connections within the tor network may work

👎 

[21-Feb-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well myu node will be totally useless, until we have vast numbers of chains ... same as mainnet.

[21-Feb-19 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
but again, just see what happens. It may be much less of a problem than we are thinking it is

[21-Feb-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`really we would just need to place them all on the same continent and be done with it.`
I still believe I can run the same setup I have in Sydney and have a nominal difference from now

{Reactions}
🤷 😕 

[21-Feb-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My guess is there is somehting wrong withthe redirect or something, and thje data is being lost.. I dont ahve the knowhow to test this shit

[21-Feb-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like itys being sent into the tor network, and then going to port 80 ? or https port isntead of 9997?

[21-Feb-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie stats dont lie. look at the maibnnet ndoes...

[21-Feb-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
SH sucks dick...

[21-Feb-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so much so ppl gave up

[21-Feb-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, back to reading books for me, if you decide to change back to not tor, ping me

[21-Feb-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well... iut doesnt work, so I will probably have to do that... so Dimxy's chains stay working.

[21-Feb-19 01:00 PM] jorian#4555
So it's regions after all? Make everyone use a node in the EU?

[21-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Mylo#8306
@Alright nice rpc contrib.
I just read your comment in #dev-he neral about testing.
I think I’m gonna be ready to test my CC Hackett next week.
What do I need to provide?

[21-Feb-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jorian  there are no regions, if you node ssucks you will just hajve to move it where it doesnt 😦

[21-Feb-19 01:01 PM] jorian#4555
Yeah, so let's make regions

[21-Feb-19 01:01 PM] jorian#4555
Or better

[21-Feb-19 01:01 PM] jorian#4555
Use 1 region

[21-Feb-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no free labs notay node for me... although I have a lot of stking weight so I might see how ti goes for a while.

[21-Feb-19 01:02 PM] jorian#4555
If you don't use the region, your stats will suck

[21-Feb-19 01:02 PM] jorian#4555
Maybe the labs network is too small

[21-Feb-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats definatly it... When i push udpate to remove tor I will increase min sigs to 6. and see what happens. 😃

[21-Feb-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant really waste too much time on these thigns, but there is still BTC ANNs and thigns to be done, so we have some time up our sleeves.

i'm a tor enthusiast at the very best

[21-Feb-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats ok , I hardly know how it works. 
I instaleld tor, then used a firewall rule to redirect all traffic from iguana port to tor proxy
then we left open the iguaan port for incomming connections. 
Each node creates a socket locally, that connects to ALL the other ndoes in the network. 
Theoretically, it should ahve routed ougoing traffic to each node, not increasing privacy but increasing hops to random times, rather than static pings. The theory was to even out ndoes distances apart.

[21-Feb-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But as soon as most nodes were on tor, we lsot all conenctivity

[21-Feb-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did a short TCPDUMP and seems there are million of ack packets.

[21-Feb-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might be overloading it, and not making a direct connection, constntly trying to connecto over and over again.
