@blackjok3r what's with the inconsistent block times

[24-Nov-18 11:05 AM] Alright#0419
any idea?

[24-Nov-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
havent ben looking

[24-Nov-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or have stats script on

[24-Nov-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my experaince with staked chains has always been that they god fast the stop

[24-Nov-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I reported it a million times, but thats just how it works.

[24-Nov-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there was no "fix" but to see what a chain does after it was older and had enough staking weight

[24-Nov-18 11:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybey because i didnt start iguana like a dumb ass

[24-Nov-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[24-Nov-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should start on its own

[24-Nov-18 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
`./start.sh` starts it for you

[24-Nov-18 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
if you have a problem `./stop.sh`, `git pull`, `./start.sh` will fix it 90% of the time

[24-Nov-18 11:07 AM] Alright#0419
do `./utxosplitter.sh` for good measure also

[24-Nov-18 11:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybe saying starting iguana  need changed

[24-Nov-18 11:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
{'error': 'cant dPoW same coin again',
 'tag': '7515933114756392042'}

[24-Nov-18 11:08 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
yeah - but don't run the utxosplitter to quick

[24-Nov-18 11:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so my cron is fucking it up?

[24-Nov-18 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I've never seen `cant dPoW same coin again`

[24-Nov-18 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
any idea?

[24-Nov-18 11:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
those were before

[24-Nov-18 11:10 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i thought iguana was running twice

[24-Nov-18 11:10 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
2 instances

[24-Nov-18 11:10 AM] Alright#0419
that will happen when you do `./start.sh` when it's already running

[24-Nov-18 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
might have zombie process iguana if `./stop.sh` isn't killing it

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
do ./stop.sh wait a minute

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok ill restart mu system and be back for 1 last call....   but stop.sh should have stoppped it

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
then `ps aux | grep iguana`

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
does it show a process?

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana really cant start twice ... it erros like crazy because it cant get the RPC port

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
hold up

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if in doubt reboot OS

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and start again

[24-Nov-18 11:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
of course

[24-Nov-18 11:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ps aux | grep iguana
kmdkrazy   745  0.0  0.0  21536  1080 pts/4    R+   06:13   0:00 grep --color=auto iguana

[24-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Alright#0419

[24-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Alright#0419

[24-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Alright#0419

[24-Nov-18 11:16 AM] jorian#4555

[24-Nov-18 11:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, where can I find those coins?

[24-Nov-18 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
if you had STAKED4 you can do `dumpwallet` then `importwallet`

[24-Nov-18 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
careful with the keys though, just saying

[24-Nov-18 11:18 AM] Alright#0419

[24-Nov-18 11:20 AM] jorian#4555

[24-Nov-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419

[24-Nov-18 11:21 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Urghhh - waiting is horrible. Have coin, have UTXO, have connections, have blocks - no notarisations.

[24-Nov-18 11:21 AM] jorian#4555
