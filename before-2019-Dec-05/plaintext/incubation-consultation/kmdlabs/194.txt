It works for assetchains as well - did it in CC autotests to run two daemon instances for same assetchain on the same machine. (https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/test_framework.py#L202) 
If it's same AC - only custom `-conf` needed, in case of different ACs I think also `-datadir` needed

[06-Jan-19 01:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @TonyL, I believe @Bar_F1sh_Rel  tested out your migration script and had some feedback.

[06-Jan-19 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @CrisF ! Sure, is this feedback in this channel somewhere?

[06-Jan-19 02:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, here it is also```Trying the .py migration script - just a note - strip any special characters out of User and Pass!!```

[06-Jan-19 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks üëç , will have a look. It's should be on 3rd party RPC lib side which I'm using.
Actually never tried username which consist not from numbers and letters only

[06-Jan-19 02:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm just noticed - for KMD connection I've used pre-generated username/password with `=` symbols without problems

[06-Jan-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
Don't understand why you don't use Emman's method to grab user/pass directly from the conf file

[06-Jan-19 02:30 AM] TonyL#3577
I can't connect to remote server in this case and cant use custom directory

[06-Jan-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's say I can run TUI on Raspberry and operate daemon on Ubuntu VPS

[06-Jan-19 02:34 AM] TonyL#3577
If parse config files - I think it's better to just use check_output stuff to call `komodo-cli` without RPC connection estabilishing

[06-Jan-19 02:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Not totally understand why need to interact with daemon via RPC if you already know that you run software on the same machine with daemon and can just call it by OS methods (check_output for python) without password or path to password revealing.
If I work with RPC connection I want to abstract from OS on which daemon running, paths to software configs or anything else

[06-Jan-19 02:45 AM] Alright#0419
I just think 99% of people will be running any dapp on the same machine as the daemon, and the other 1% would be smart enough to change 2 lines in the code. My point is that I think you're catering to an edge case

[06-Jan-19 02:45 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter, was really just curious of your reasoning behind that

[06-Jan-19 02:47 AM] TonyL#3577
I think optimal dAPP for non-technical people is when daemon not running on their machines at all (SPV stuff)

[06-Jan-19 02:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Currents apps are for devs mostly obv

[06-Jan-19 02:48 AM] Alright#0419
I've thought about it, but we need some way to limit which commands will work

[06-Jan-19 02:48 AM] Alright#0419
is that possible with what we have right now?

[06-Jan-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/electrum-proxy/tree/master/routes/electrum current electrum-proxy calls amount is very imitated as I understand

[06-Jan-19 02:50 AM] Alright#0419
Need to research how exactly that works. We need something like this for migrates.

[06-Jan-19 02:50 AM] Alright#0419
Need a server that can handle the single KMD command needed, so users don't need a KMD node running to do a migrate

[06-Jan-19 02:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a migrations serving node?

[06-Jan-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
the `migrate_completeimporttransaction` step in a migrate requires a KMD full node

[06-Jan-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
but it isn't actually handling sensitive data

[06-Jan-19 02:53 AM] Alright#0419
so we should host a server that people can use specifically for that step

[06-Jan-19 02:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, if there is a way to restrict all other calls expect this one - it's possible to do a  straightforward like a `rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0`
And hardcode credentials in migrations scripts

[06-Jan-19 02:54 AM] TonyL#3577
But seems ultra unsafe anyway hehe

[06-Jan-19 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
I know insight supports `sendrawtransaction` somehow, might be able to use some of that code

[06-Jan-19 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
https://www.kmdexplorer.io/tx/send

[06-Jan-19 03:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Clue is to generate it

[06-Jan-19 03:06 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not expert in this tech too but I think Electrum can send transactions since Agama can do it in SPV mode

[06-Jan-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
U can just have a kmd node with that one RPC call working only

[06-Jan-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And use a rate limiter

[06-Jan-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So ppl can't spam it to death

Not sure about the rebuild, but chains are moving along alright here.

[06-Jan-19 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
What error message are you getting?

[06-Jan-19 09:23 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@TonyL - I think it was the pre-generated ``\`` symbol that caught me out.

[06-Jan-19 09:24 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
on the password

[06-Jan-19 09:31 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bar_F1sh_Rel Thanks! Will try different symbols
Beside of this issue with password - is script made a migration job fine on your side?

[06-Jan-19 09:32 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

[06-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - next question.   with your python guis, did you try to run them on a mobile device?   and if so, did you happen to use a websocket library to do any comms?

[06-Jan-19 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577

Oh I think poker client making is too cool for my GUIs making skill

[06-Jan-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm not sure if it related to any of latest changes but FSM komodod started to randomly hangs after I broadcast many oracles transactions e.g. oraclesregister or oraclesdata (even if I do it gentle with delay and checking mempool that previous is here)
And it hangs so hard so only reboot helps (even if I kill process I can't start same asset chain because he telling me that assetchain files are already in use)
