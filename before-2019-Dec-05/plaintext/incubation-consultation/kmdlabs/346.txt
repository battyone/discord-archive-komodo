A discussion on something like this 👇  would be good to have.  Set up of something like this would go a long way towards making Labs more effective when projects start coming in. 
-----```----------- Please see https://kmdlabs.cc/p/KMDLabs_operations_proposal for context. -----------

 'If the bureaucracy grows too large the Group Consensus can cull it as needed.`

Basically this mechanism would allow people to get on with Dev work and using LABs. The elected volunteers would be given the responsibility for day-to-day matters to make this possible. The way things would work aren't all that different than now. For example, asking opinions on how to multisig or what logo looks better. The only real changes I see from now are that Labs Elected Volunteer(LEV)s would have some ability to take action through the limited trust granted to them through election by Stakers. The LEV could then make a decision based on what they have learned. LEVs serve the Group Consensus, and if their actions vary too widely from that path, then Group Consensus has the power to bring things back into line. At the moment we are still setting things up and most Dev work is focussed on Labs. That will change and people, including LEVs, will be focussed on using the Labs platform. I think the LEV jobs will loose their glamour fairly quickly when it is realized how much work will be required, while others are out there having fun. This is the nature of volunteer work.
```

There are many non-dev thing we can do to prepare for launch.

[31-Mar-19 12:44 AM] CrisF#3405
I suggest starting with those 😃

[31-Mar-19 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great @dimxy  thanks look forward to it. That fits in great with my schedule too. We should be able to get this all working in the coming week.

I have worked out how to do notary pay for 0BR chains. Turned out to be extremly simple. 
``` 
Need to tally notarypay in connect tip, and dissconnect tip. Each time a notary pay coinbase is paid we add to total, when its been reorged we deduct total. 
Write the total to a file each time this happens.
Load the file on daemon init, and delete it if the daemon has been instructed to reindex. 
There is a burn address that uses a private key of all zeros. 
RPC will be created that checks if the amount paid is greater than the amount burnt. 
Iguana will poll this RPC at the start of a notarization round to ask if it can notarize or not. ```
In the event of a somone forgetting to top up the burn address and notarizations have stopped, we can use the notary backup import to get funds to the chain. 
I can also add the notary pay amounts to the notarizations DB, and there can be a backup that loops over the notarization DB and tallies all the amounts paid, in case of the file being corrupted. Not sure if this is even needed at all, guess feild test will tell us.

Managed to write most of this in the car on the way home 😆  
Assuming it works, it was extremly easy. I just hope I can still sync one of the notary pay chains to test it. 
All I need is the correct burn address. There is one in the code, but not sure how to check that it is actually that right now. I managed to add notarypay total to the on disk block index, so that covers all connect/dissconnect. Also managed to work out how to save segid to disk so it no longer has to be calculated for all blocks upon chain restart.

[31-Mar-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Provided people dont spam the shit out of the burn address with tiny utxos, three should be almost zero preformance hit to calling this before every notarization. If someone does do this, we may need to rethink how to go about it. Although it would take hundreds of thousands of utxos in the address to really slow it down  to where it would make a diffence.

[31-Mar-19 10:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is increased txfee for funds sent to burn address an option to dissuade would be attackers?

[31-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem is that to limit sending to an address you need to scan every address in every transaction for every block.. Maybe we can do this just for these chains but Im not sure...

[31-Mar-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We already check for notarizations for notary pay, so maybe I can just add it in there.. But its really not a problem I think.. And really, if someone does do it, its only for cluster chains, not LABS itself.. All notaries will have the saem disadvantage...

[31-Mar-19 10:58 AM] CrisF#3405
`it would take hundreds of thousands of utxos in the address` sounds like a `dwy attack`

[31-Mar-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its exactly that, and really that attack breaks everything... On any blockchain... but if we cna engineer around it so it cannot break our shit, then we should lol

[31-Mar-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to finish this off.. need to get code off laptop to my PC, so the LABS repos may not be able to be built for a few hours. Please do not update until i say its ok.

@Mylo  Im adding you now... and changing the iguana port so we can get the network ready for some tests. 
In 8H the era will change to 4, in 1H approx I will change the iguana port on my node. Hopefully 6 people update before 8H is up and we start notarizing the new chain without any -26 errors.

not sure... Nabob made a PR with it ages ago thaught it was fixed...

[01-Apr-19 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its not just isntall manually... We will need to verify these things all work again from a clean VPS before launch... Im still finding minor bugs around the palce in start scipts

[01-Apr-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to be a fair delay on this. I need to reindex KMD then will make bootstrap for you guys to use. @SHossain  can you race me for a resync of KMD with the very latest master?

[01-Apr-19 11:00 AM] SHossain#0007

I changed the format of the block index so we need a fresh sync to use as bootstrap

you mean fresh sync?

[01-Apr-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Apr-19 11:00 AM] SHossain#0007
didn't do fresh sync.

i tried to update last night. got help human

[01-Apr-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... It wont work

[01-Apr-19 11:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any chance of it being an actual bootstrap and not a copy/paste of the 2 dirs?

[01-Apr-19 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
ran `./start.sh` today and it started all build up

[01-Apr-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just tried it dor a whille. It will be the entire thing -wallet.dat and conf and I'lls tick on my webserver... its not the fastest connection

[01-Apr-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it might eb faster than resyncing for all of us

[01-Apr-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If one other person can fresh sync... maybe if yours is syncing it will work

[01-Apr-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will just say "corrupt HDD data" when you try and start it with the latest... taht code has been there since yesterday sometime

[01-Apr-19 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. started fresh sync

[01-Apr-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks dude.. That will speed us up a bit.. I have to sync it here on my local PC then uplaod it to my server it will take all night

[01-Apr-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK I got explorers up for all the current LABS chains. 
http://140.82.3.117:3002 to port 3005. 
KMD needing a reindex sucks... I think its best if we just get it over an done with and get a bootstrap hsoted for it to save time later... the alternative is not a nice way to code it.

[01-Apr-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what does that mean exactly... the only way I know how to do it is a tar of the folder that doesnt have the wallet.dat and conf

[01-Apr-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the 2 folders only means you missing the notarizations and a bunch of other thigns we need.

[01-Apr-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Anyone who wants to, start a fresh sync of KMD and all LABS chains currently in assetchains.json 
Tomorrow I will finish this off with era change etc... Likely the cluster is going to stop working for a day or 2, but we need to get this done.

a "true" bootstrap is a single dat that is a concatenation of blk00000.dat-blk000xx.dat

[01-Apr-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm well I dont know how to do that, so no lol

[01-Apr-19 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`cat blk000*.dat > bootstrap.dat`?

[01-Apr-19 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well its going to take all night to resync KMD here then I need to do that, then uplaod it on 25mbit.... so It might be better if someone else does it...

[01-Apr-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So just so everyone is on the same page.
We are testing N&K params of 77/3 on CFEKNK and notarypay with a "burn address" that has been funded with 200 coins. 
What should happen is that CFEKNK should stop notarizing on all notaries after 200 notarizations when the burn address runs out of funds.  When this happens we can send some more coins to the address and it should start to notarize again automagically. 
If this goes well, we have a proof of concept that allows any chain to have a block reward/coin emission that is limited by the amount of  coins burnt to an address. 
If anyone ever spends from this address the chain will no longer be able to create any coins. 
The problem is that whenever we add something to this it changes the blockindex format... so we need to reindex KMD. Hopefully I can think of a solution for this as its pretty darn annoying. Easy one is to revert the change on a special branch just for KMD and update the start scritps to use this branch for KMD...This time around I'm not doing that though, as we will be using this param for every clusterchain so we need the blockindex mod.

Starting  chains with `start.sh` is fine, or is manual better?

[01-Apr-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its best to resync, but start.sh isnt going to work because KMD wont start unless you delete its blocks chainstate komodostate etc

[01-Apr-19 12:03 PM] CrisF#3405
I deleted everything

[01-Apr-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@LabsAssistant 
Please update all repos, and RESYNC all chains  INCLUDING KMD. We have ~24H  until era change. That should be long enough for KMD to resync. Sorry about this, but rather get this over and done with. We can host a few bootstraps after this with the new block index format. I will put on up on my server ASAP, but will be a while away. It will probably be faster to just resync the chain yourself. 
See last pin for reasons for this if you missed it.
