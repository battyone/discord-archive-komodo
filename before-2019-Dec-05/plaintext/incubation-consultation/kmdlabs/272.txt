Its not liek KMD where we get like 75% of all mine dcoins, ours will be liek 25%, the otehr way around. Possibly... not 100% sure on this, still trying to wrap my head around the math of it all.

[05-Feb-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The other option, is to have every 2 months an extra notary is added.... but if there are no candidates that step forward then you need to allocate more than one per person... theing may get messy there, very much want to keep one person per node if we can, and adjust the amount of nodes to how much demand there is to be a notary.

put an ad on gumtree, you'll have them lining up :troll_hardcore:

I dont think you'll have a hard time getting people in, but turnover might be high if there's not a epic quest to complete before being granted entry.

[05-Feb-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Someone just gave a great suggestion.... Let notaries be dynamic, set their pay % on the chain, every 2 months notaris can leave or enter as they see fit based on costs just liek miners... If a notary cannot do their job they just drop out... If notaries are killing it, more just join. Dont really need a vote or anything, because we are jsut paid to notarise. The value of the coin will determine how many notaries there are.. 

Make the bounty system seperate with a multisig for that. Notaries job is to notarise. By letting basically anyone be one upto a limit of 64 you solve the collusion problem also. There is only 1 possible thing that can stop this working and I already know how to fix it, and will not be disclosing what it is until it is fixed 😄

[05-Feb-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
what about the sybil problem?

[05-Feb-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we dont mine any blocks miners just create a coinbase with money in it for us if we notarise .. although im not sure I know what that is exactly.

[05-Feb-19 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sybil problem can be solved with "Proof - of Discord" 😂

[05-Feb-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Limit increase of notary pubkeys to a small number every 2 months, notary needs to be active LABS member... done.

[05-Feb-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would tak emonths of being multipl identies every day ...

[05-Feb-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess if the reward was alrge enough... and they were detemined enough it could be an issue

[05-Feb-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`notary needs to be active LABS member.`
_frowns at the idea of getting sidetracked and not getting a new slot if he ever loses his_

[05-Feb-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure you would lost.. if you keep notarising how would you be dropped

[05-Feb-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
an extra 44 notaris is a LOT for us to accobodate at mayne 1 extra adder per month

[05-Feb-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, because I've never said "fek it all" and walked away before, right? :troll:

[05-Feb-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
true... But paying per notarisation means the amount of notaries can vary, it cant be based on existing notaries to decide how many there are though... because its in their intrests to have less, they get paid more.

[05-Feb-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so there has to be a way to let ppl join without being complciated

[05-Feb-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
was j/k, even when I walked away from chat, I never left the important stuff

[05-Feb-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah sorry I know.... im just thinking about this ha

[05-Feb-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might be time for a break here... let others read over this. Maybe someone has a better idea 🤷

[05-Feb-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The issue(s) I see with the "active" requirement is
What determines "active"?
What stops someone from using 2 accounts, being "active" on each, and picking up 2 slots?

[05-Feb-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they could but woundnt someone notice ?

[05-Feb-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only other way is to enforce we MUST increase 1 notary spot every 2 onths.... and if there isnt someone to do it, let a known person randomly be choses to take the open spot

[05-Feb-19 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
notice what? Without analysis of writing patterns, the only way to "know" is if they do like I did and just blatantly state things only account1 could known from account2

thats not how I remeber it going down 😛

[05-Feb-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a problem thouhg.. its always bveen a problem.. even is for main net ntoaries...

[05-Feb-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
without some kind of 🐔  verification you cant really limit one node to one person

[05-Feb-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats where the original idea was floated that you needed to lock coins to get a spot each 2 months

[05-Feb-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

so it wes super hard for someone to just make heaps of accounts/keys

[05-Feb-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that also forces notaries to basically be whales lol...

[05-Feb-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now if there was a "pool" of potential notaries and they have to put up some "deposit" so it cost money then get randomly chosen maybe that counld work.

[05-Feb-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I think thats where the original idea was floated that you needed to lock coins to get a spot each 2 months`
I must have missed that bit, because I would remember loudly opposing such a notion

[05-Feb-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was extremly early on... seemed to get ditched

[05-Feb-19 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know the answer has been "we're not doing it that way", but I still think the better option is résumé elections like Komodo

[05-Feb-19 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant change them every 2months liek that

[05-Feb-19 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no body will vote as per what SMK said .. .

[05-Feb-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I did say a weited vote, but apaprently thats no good... becasue notaries can easily just suck up msot of the supply in the first few months and never let anyone in

[05-Feb-19 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other than initial building phase (i.e., now),why 2 and not 6 or 12?

[05-Feb-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sybil problem as per james... someone just creating a bunch of notaries and voer powering the network

[05-Feb-19 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure that would apply *as much* with the "this is who I am and why you should vote for me" type thing

[05-Feb-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you need to limit the number... I gues it would depend on the number of candidates ?

[05-Feb-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if 10 ppl want to joiun let 3 in ... hopefully the other 7 show up in 2 months

[05-Feb-19 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it sounds kinda dickish, I'm sure, but if they don't want the job in 2 more months, did they really want it anyway?

[05-Feb-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exactkly... that was my reasoning too 😄

[05-Feb-19 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its kind of the only known way to determine that one person isnt gettting mroe ndoes... but you need to reember that current notaries get paid less coins, the more notaris there are. so you need to fix the number .. until we hit 64 (that is provided nobody decides to drop out)

[05-Feb-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so something like, +1 person every month (so 2 ppl elected after era1) if sombody leaves then only 1 person gets in...

[05-Feb-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becasu if you force it too high,and we arent making enough cash to keep all those notaries up .... what happens

[05-Feb-19 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but you need to reember that current notaries get paid less coins`
The mentality should be "early adoption bonus" and not "more notaries are feking my income". again, if they can't think that way, do we really want their involvement anyway?

[05-Feb-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well.. if you start early on, you should ahe staking wweight so its not that bad

[05-Feb-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
unless you lost the keys to those addys

[05-Feb-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still... who would vote to get paid LESS

[05-Feb-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
true that

[05-Feb-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you have to fix this ... into the rules at the very start

[05-Feb-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or ppl going to get really wild about it lalter on

[05-Feb-19 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`still... who would vote to get paid LESS`
Someone that wants to see it succeed and can do the math that 1.5625% of value is better than 5% of no/less value

[05-Feb-19 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the stronger it is will be the more adoption it will have

[05-Feb-19 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more adoption = more value

agreed... but you dont need to be a ntoary to be using this... but it cant work without them, and the more of them there are, the better it works.

[05-Feb-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it cant work without them, and the more of them there are, the better it works.`
That's what I'm saying. And, like I said, it's simple math. Hard to visualize/accept the larger picture, but once they do it's simple math.

[05-Feb-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1.5625% of 100 satoshis is better than 5% of 1 satoshi

[05-Feb-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so out of this what are your suggested way to handle adding notaries dynamicaly exactly. I feel liek we got somewhere here, but I need to define it lol..

[05-Feb-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like notaries decide how many notaries to add... or election for 1 position ....

[05-Feb-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or election for % of candidates that show up?

[05-Feb-19 12:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is right, but people buy billions of Verge.

we should not encourage participation of such people :troll_compadre:

[05-Feb-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure how to design the functionality (given that no one has any CoinX to base "votes" off to begin with), but I think that it needs to be a "free election system" to avoid:
\* us picking our friends - centralization
\* me making 14 accounts, not being me on 13 of them, and picking up a dozen nodes
because we need:
\* at least a minimalistic vetting process
\* us not picking our friends

[05-Feb-19 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I fell like something like this will work, but maybe we still missing something:
1) every 2 months there is 2 spots avalible, until we reach 64 nodes. Provided nobody drops out or decides to leave. 
2) If soemone is litterally gone/their node is attacking us/ etc .. being bad actor., other ntoaries vote to remove that node (by majority vote)
3) the genral election is run where the 2 spots are given out. Maybe a short list is voted by that is then chosen at random. 

This prevents the thing growing too fast beyond what it can sustain. As is a notary cannot fill their obligation they are replaced by a new voted in node. If it is growing, and it nobody wants to leave we still have the 2 spots. After this stage, when we get to 64 (if we get there) we use a yearly election same as KMD. 

❓

[05-Feb-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`2) If soemone is litterally gone/their node is attacking us/ etc .. being bad actor., other ntoaries vote to remove that node (by majority vote)`
How do we stop that from being:
 I'm a dick, no one wants to hear my shit anymore, and they force me out regardless of utility
?

[05-Feb-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Has to be a low pereforming node or actually attacking the network

[05-Feb-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not there to remove personal shit

[05-Feb-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ther would ahve to be some defined rult to break to be elegible for that vote

[05-Feb-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181

`Has to be a low pereforming node or actually attacking the network`
I'm just saying that, presently, you're the only one having the ability to code consensus checks, so that seems like a large self-imposed burden to code in

[05-Feb-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I say that a node elegible to be voted out must have liker less than 10% of the average notarisations (totally ignores their job) or is consantly attacking the network preventing notarisations happening.

[05-Feb-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a very unlikely thing that would happen

[05-Feb-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  The best way to design a protocol is always be mindful of "will this still work if no one currently involved is still involved? Can it out live us?"
