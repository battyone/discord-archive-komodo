I like the idea of "after action reports" being tied to payout. survey data etc offers some intel and perspectives those of u s on the frontline might not see

[13-Jan-19 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
I do like smk's categories, but I'm not a fan of a "judging machine". I'd like to see something that is easily publicly verifiable

[13-Jan-19 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great ideas everyone... I also agree that 5k kmd is a bit much especially with Tony's script probably being able to fill blocks on a few nodes... Getting the most will be just about impossible, the strongest miner will likely win in this case by ignoring others txns

[13-Jan-19 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah want to keep rules simple

[13-Jan-19 02:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Simple is good.  Maybe some random prizes.  100,000th migrate gets 50kmd. Somethings like that.

Connecting 'getting people involved with this test' and 'launch' seems like it would be important to me.

💯 

[13-Jan-19 02:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Carry over into getting people using labs for their own testing and dev work.

[13-Jan-19 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to get an explorer up for this new chain... it seems to be working quite well, script has one bug, I will fix that today... could be a bit tricky as what its doing makes very little sense.

[13-Jan-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
did we add a chain other than Y and X?

[13-Jan-19 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I added a 51% PoS chain not fungible

[13-Jan-19 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for testing staker after all my changes

[13-Jan-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
testing with 2 nodes is working... have to make sure ti works with more though.

[13-Jan-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, would have just given you some MGNX 😛

[13-Jan-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
I found that it's not handling pow blocks properly

[13-Jan-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
chain is too long... had to test mroe than just ther... did founders fo 1440 is working perfectly.

[13-Jan-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
although maybe my setup is wonky, I made a new list.json but didn't move coins away from old set of addresses

[13-Jan-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a feeling maybe the bug I am seeing, is from PoW mining a few utxos at the chain start.... abnd its only when those stake that it breaks.

[13-Jan-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll have to add some prints... and yeah there was a few things I didnt know, need to clean them up a bit..

[13-Jan-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
i want to add handling for sending new coins to pubkey address

[13-Jan-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
and have them distribute smartly somehow

[13-Jan-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
so for example if someone buys some new coins they want to stake and send them to pubkey address, they won't all end up in single UTXO

[13-Jan-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[13-Jan-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made 2 coins distribution scripts...

[13-Jan-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or modified yuours

[13-Jan-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
well the way i see it is that it needs to be easy enough for a typical windows user

[13-Jan-19 02:33 AM] Alright#0419
I think I can make it watch for incoming transactions to the pubkey address then distribute coins itself

[13-Jan-19 02:33 AM] Alright#0419
so adding more coins to stake is seamless

[13-Jan-19 02:34 AM] Alright#0419
right now it's far from that

[13-Jan-19 02:48 AM] axo777#1232
What are the tools needed to participate in the test?

[13-Jan-19 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently you need a full node of KMD, and a full node of each chain in the cluster (the cluster for stresstest is not made yet, possibly 4 chains) 
I find an 8GB RAM VPS is perfect to do a very large amount of migrates even on bash, likely with Tony's script it will be even less.

[13-Jan-19 02:50 AM] Alright#0419
2 more chains on top of that if we're doing this oracles thing

[13-Jan-19 02:51 AM] axo777#1232
so 6 servers?

[13-Jan-19 02:51 AM] Alright#0419
1 server

[13-Jan-19 02:53 AM] axo777#1232
1 daemon +4 chains + 2 oracles all on one server?

[13-Jan-19 03:01 AM] gt#2812
with the python script i’m running into issues with signing the kmd part

[13-Jan-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
@axo777 each chain is a separate instance of the same daemon

[13-Jan-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
all of which can be ran on the same server

[13-Jan-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
@gt what is the problem exactly

[13-Jan-19 03:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@gt check your rpc credentials, make sure no backslashes etc

[13-Jan-19 03:04 AM] axo777#1232
thanks.  what tool to watch the server?

[13-Jan-19 03:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had same issue

[13-Jan-19 03:11 AM] Alright#0419
@axo777 new specific tool, mostly just watching logs and outputs

[13-Jan-19 03:11 AM] Alright#0419
believe smk is trying to make some kind of visualization of it though

[13-Jan-19 03:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
eventually... lots to do...

Really need to focus on important things... A visulsation of the migrate stresstest is something more benificial to HYPE and getting people to go WOW! and want to join, its a great idea, and would be nice... but not exactly required... Maybe I will speak to the marketing team, and see if they can put up some KMD for such a thing to compensate you for the time to make it. 😃 
Its really something they can use and point people to at any time. To show that migrates work at scale.

[13-Jan-19 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Merged

[13-Jan-19 03:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
too quick @blackjok3r !

[13-Jan-19 03:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
bash version had a typo, fixed and resubmitted

[13-Jan-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[13-Jan-19 03:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the bash version crafts a json string I"ll use for visualisation

[13-Jan-19 03:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will integrate oracle write onto that script this week. works for everyone using it, but @TonyL ;s python script is better for bulk send so will port it to py after that

[13-Jan-19 03:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it'd mean only those using the script would be on recorded on oracle and into vis tho

[13-Jan-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes best to experiment in bash I think... tonys script is pretty fast... Bash really wasnt able to do anywhere near that level of migrates relaiably... I lost many coins runnign 10,000 loops at once.

[13-Jan-19 03:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so will keep an eye out for standalone script whiuch sees and knows all

[13-Jan-19 03:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been migrating coins to tony's address all week :p

[13-Jan-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL

[13-Jan-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
good thing the blcok reward on both chains is 1000 lol

[13-Jan-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
darn this staker script.... it fised itself while I was sleeping...

[13-Jan-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that the bug I saw is a rare edge case

[13-Jan-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
related to starting the chain. Might not be a problem.

[13-Jan-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is there anyone who has time to test out staking ? I can create some scripts to pull off utxos from a staking node based on the amount of confirms? I just realised I'm staking over a million coins on a single node, and the daily rewards are too low... maybe 100,000 would ahve been a better number to use lol

[13-Jan-19 03:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I tried staking 500 last night, didnt get anything from it... makes sense now :p

[13-Jan-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my staker is very efficiant and is also a whale .. .I doubt anyone is going to find any coins at all against it... I need to start pulling funds from it slowly and bring the diff down

[13-Jan-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will do this today... scripts for withdrawing funds from a staking node will be needed anyway... you need to use creat raw transaction and thats very much out of reach for most people.

[13-Jan-19 03:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I made somethin basic to toggle on/off mining/staking, but it's untested... well I tested it but got nothing staking lol

staking the majority of the supply will give bad results

[13-Jan-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
as in not real world conditions

[13-Jan-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
would recommend testing on MGNX

[13-Jan-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fuck mgnx for now... still need more tools for this... Can test on this, think mgnx is synced here at least... can test there later once I have it all working

[13-Jan-19 03:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If all that's needed is to get some coins and turn on staking I'm in, need to test that script properly

[13-Jan-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah cool... be a few hours to work out a way to withdraw coins from staking node... then let you know what to do. 😃

[13-Jan-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I mined about 600, but cant compete!

[13-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
hold on I'll give you some MGNX

[13-Jan-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not with 1 million coins 3500 utxos and an efficnat distribution algo

[13-Jan-19 03:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dont have MGNX installed, but can if needed

[13-Jan-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can make the disribution algo even better, but these type of things wont be public yet... I want well commented python sctipts that people can work with so we get all diffrent ways tro stake and stuff. There has to be better ways than just spreading evenly over segids

[13-Jan-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im just tsestinfg on CFEKPOS51 for now... once I have scritps working I will use MGNX to test which algo works best

I can help with needed data writing to oracle for current python script if needed. Have a quite huge codebase for oracles writing now so maybe even will not need to code much

[13-Jan-19 03:58 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm very sorry for your lost coins @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  😃 Actually took this address hardcode when re-wrote script from bash to python as it is

[13-Jan-19 03:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, actually donated, not lost 😂

[13-Jan-19 04:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Can use let's say current oracle `D` type publisher so data will be compressed. It's quite reliable according to my tests - published few megs files consisted of hundreds of 8KiB chunks - and md5 hashes of origin and downloaded from oracle version matches

[13-Jan-19 04:01 AM] TonyL#3577
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Did you want to write data to the oracle on the fly or first to keep everything locally ?

[13-Jan-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea was to save the export and payouts, to oracle so incase of faliure or crash the migrate can be resumed.

[13-Jan-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Why not to use local DB like Mongo or just text files?

[13-Jan-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
If goal is continue the process

[13-Jan-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because cris wantesd to use oracles in the origional plan laid out

[13-Jan-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see

[13-Jan-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If that is no good and you guys dont want to do it then dont

[13-Jan-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its really up to the people implementing it to decide what is best

[13-Jan-19 04:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I just thought there was some reason to make data immutable or/and public available

[13-Jan-19 04:19 AM] TonyL#3577
It's great if oracles will be used for it

[13-Jan-19 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
YeahI think that has something to do with it... Cris had this idea that testinfg and logging can be done onchain so its trransparent and immutable, cannot be lost etc.

[13-Jan-19 04:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Means more people will play with it and more Komodo tech will be used in test
