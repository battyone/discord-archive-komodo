Not sure exactly how that happens yet... its seeing a notarisation

[04-Feb-19 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and creating a block. then rejecting it because the notarisation is seen as invalid... but if another miner mines it....then the chain keeps moving...

[04-Feb-19 01:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well all I know is 1 notarization = 1 less utxo and +6.2499 coin
was that the intent?

[04-Feb-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... The pay is a bit high lol... but thsi is just a test chain....

[04-Feb-19 01:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yay, it works 🙂

[04-Feb-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It 90% works

[04-Feb-19 01:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we like when it works

[04-Feb-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sometimes it doesnt

[04-Feb-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if I move the validation check earlier.. so it doesnt select  what it sees as an invalid ntoarisation in the first palce... if a node does see it as valid ti will mine it... othersise it will just make a normal block

[04-Feb-19 01:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@barv = #coincollect I believe

[04-Feb-19 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
~8064 notarizations/month genie. Should help you visualize about how much each would be on mainnet

[04-Feb-19 01:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, update was required for CFEKX miner node to see notarizations (I'm guessing that's because of the new changes?)

[04-Feb-19 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with the z_mergetoaddress modification gettin paid dust is no problem

[04-Feb-19 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It couldnt see then at all? or just the priority print?

[04-Feb-19 01:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It couldnt see then at all? or just the priority print?`
I'm assuming it just saw them as regular txes because all prints and rpc replies stopped seeing notarizations sometime yesterday
It kept seeing and creating valid blocks, jut not recognizing the notarizations
It's been over a week since I updated that miner node, so it's more anecdotal than anything else

[04-Feb-19 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats weird... maybe there was some random commit on that version you were using that broke them? I was messing around with some stuff that could have done that earlier on

[04-Feb-19 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as its working now... thats all that really matters

[04-Feb-19 01:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe, just thought I'd mention it in case anyone else was still on an old miner build

[04-Feb-19 01:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anyway, back to enjoying what's left of our anniversary weekend...

[04-Feb-19 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed possible fix for miner... Simple one.. Just stop the miner tyrying to mine an invalid block so at elast they dont waste hash rate.... Dont think it will be good with a pool though, as it will just not be able to fetch its block template.

[04-Feb-19 06:59 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
restarted NN - start.sh now stops just after LABSTPAY comes up - "Can't find longest chain" - so Iguana never comes up.

[04-Feb-19 08:25 AM] barv#0867
@Alright I was asking this because I read the tweet by CA about a kind of 'dpow lite' and I was wondering how that is different from what we know already. I understand now it is more like the onboarding is more simple? Do you still need to contact a NN to get started, or is that automated?

[04-Feb-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how ca is doing it for that system. But all we have done is change the pubkeys so that you can run your own ntoary nodes  to notarise to KMD. Without breakign dpow inside the komodo daemon for KMD.

{Reactions}
🙏 

[04-Feb-19 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorryt if that sounds confusing... It simpy allows anyone to notarise anything to KMD without needing the KMD ntoary nodes directly... Its uses them indirectly by notarisign to KMD, they get the benefit of the BTC secuity KMD notarty nodes provide KMD.

[04-Feb-19 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Bar_F1sh_Rel  
You need to receive a block to see longest chain... and me and Alright hit that chain with a mini for 10 minutes  ... so the chain is stalled dead 😂

[04-Feb-19 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Spent all day messing with the verus difficutly aglo trying to work out hwo to get it to work with equihash... but it flat out doesnt work. 😦 Divides by 0... I think you ened to do horribly complex maths to use diffrent values to prevent it dividing by 0. 😦

[04-Feb-19 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not something I want to be messign with at thios time.. Shouldnt matter, we just need to use VerusHash11 for all 0 block reward chains. The main chain should ahve a reasonable hash rate, so it wornt matter.

[04-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Lumbi#8378
@blackjok3r Berkeley called a/0s "ghosts of departed quantities" 👻
...and here I am just tryin' to build "dumb-smart" business contracts :3040_kingpeepo:

[04-Feb-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
havent even got to contracts yet..... lol

[04-Feb-19 10:03 AM] barv#0867
@blackjok3r thx. I think I get it. CA was tweeting about your (kmdlabs) proceedings. So basically, anyone can timestamp checkpoints in kmd blockchain using kmd labs service.

[04-Feb-19 10:03 AM] barv#0867
@blackjok3r could it also be a private chain checkpointing?

[04-Feb-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes.. We changed the daemon, so it can use multiple sets of pubkeys... You can create notarisations with your fork of komodod without all komodod daemons everywhere tracking all the notarisatinos.

[04-Feb-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any chain cna place the checkpoint

[04-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But the MoMoM specific stuff requires a KMD assetchain

[04-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most of what we did here, is all KMD assetchain based

[04-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it could be ported to other coins

[04-Feb-19 10:05 AM] barv#0867
That is really cool. Opens up great opportunities for corporate blockchain projects

[04-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have been running multiple keys for nearly a year here I think... it was pretty easy to get working, but very ahrd to get working without bugs

[04-Feb-19 10:08 AM] barv#0867
Good to know. If I bump into a project like this, i know how to find you of course. Komodo asset chains are of great use for many business type of applications I think. Convincing corporates just takes a long breath

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Feb-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are certainly good things happening... Its very easy base to build with if you know what your doing. We have chains working hre that pay out based on previous transactions... like coinbases that can change... its pretty cool stuff..

[04-Feb-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This isnt even using CCs

[04-Feb-19 10:10 AM] barv#0867
Cool. Yes, I get updates from @Mylo every now and then. Impressive work

[04-Feb-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For the main chain I had to get the notary pay working as fast as possible to launch it.. I think a contract will be better for 0BR chains... but that said I dont really see how exactly it can even work.

[04-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how does a contract know that a notarisation is valid? Can it even call the function that validates them? What is one node sees something diffrent to another and rejects a notarisation?

[04-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Does that fork it?

[04-Feb-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm .. I think its pretty easy to understaand if I explain it properly.. the code is extremly well commented for -ac_notarypay= chains... it was very hajrd to brain storm out the process... and it changed a few times as I wrote it.. Ran into a few dead ends along the way. I think it still has some possible problem, but the chain appears to work.. even with 300 block happenign in 10 mins.

{Reactions}
🆗 

[04-Feb-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I need a way to flag a notarisation thats invalid... but some nodes might see a notarisation as invalid when other see it as valid... so doing hta might not work.. Once the notarisation is included by just 1 miner, then that chain is the chain everyone must follow.

[04-Feb-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which is kind of how it already works...

[04-Feb-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What effecttivly is happening, is that we are making the checkpoint transaction itself a checkpoint, the block its included in must be accpeted by all nodes.

[04-Feb-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so evey node must accept a notarisation as valid, if the miner who mined that transaction saw it as  valid.

[04-Feb-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doing it with a CC, basically notary nodes would be able to send txs with min sigs to the contract.. .na then have coins avalibe to withdraw... too much trust in them not to cheat for my liking. This wasy they just cant cheat.

Yeah I got that earlier - can start iguana manually though.

[04-Feb-19 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yeah, manual iguana start works for getting the others working, but LABSTPAY refuses to sync no matter what build I try

[04-Feb-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
@barv I don't think we're offering a service to external projects. We're offering a service to people who want to run fungible LABS chains

[04-Feb-19 10:53 PM] Alright#0419
I mean there's nothing to stop notaries from doing that, but that's not really the plan

[04-Feb-19 10:58 PM] barv#0867
Don’t worry @Alright . It’s not about creating jobs here. It’s just that the tech deserves to be used at corporates as well

[04-Feb-19 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
Yes I imagine any cluster would want their own dpow network

[04-Feb-19 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
unless it's a very simple cluster

[04-Feb-19 11:33 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just removed LABSTPAY from my assetchains,json

[04-Feb-19 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
Yea sorry guys, we did mining stress test yesterday. I was meant to unstuck the chain, but it completely slipped my mind

[05-Feb-19 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
ok running a mini with diff on the port set very high

[05-Feb-19 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
so it'll slowly bring the diff down

[05-Feb-19 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 do you have any idea why my mini does 0sols when it connects to a new pool until it is completely rebooted

[05-Feb-19 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
😂 and now it's showing twice the hashrate than it really is

[05-Feb-19 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
did I just find a nomp exploit? 🤣

[05-Feb-19 01:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what base code? I'll take a look in the am

[05-Feb-19 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
joker's knomp fork

[05-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
no idea how I did it, but web interface was showing twice as much hashrate on my mini

[05-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
will try to reproduce it

[05-Feb-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This sounds like a bug with start.sh if there are no blocks happened ing but the chain is older then 128 blocks it should still start. I will look at this shortly.

[05-Feb-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
believe it just doesn't start if longestchain is 0

[05-Feb-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
chain is moving again btw

[05-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
diff coming down slowly

[05-Feb-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's cool, but it should start if longest chain is 0

[05-Feb-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That function to check sync got extremely complicated my bet is I can remove like 90% of it

[05-Feb-19 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess the entire thing may need to be rewritten but if the branch builds and the chain syncs its working quite well now.

[05-Feb-19 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just these edge cases where things don't go as expected.

[05-Feb-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed fix to start.sh. If a chain is just stalled it will now allow auto starting of iguana. The idea was that the start.sh would fail, and you would see the reson it was failed. then start it manually... But when it was all fully automated ages ago, it got a bit compicated.

[05-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure what I am supposed to be working on atm. So going to play with chain params for 0BR chains and try to do some econimics of how expensive they will be....

[05-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its possible to extend a chains length as long as more LABS is burnt far enough in advance for notaries to increase the chains maximum height.

[05-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This avoids tricky CC contract complications in the coin emission... Just have notaries verify the LABS was burnt to cover the notarisation cost.

[05-Feb-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its even possible to make it so that the chain is free and notarisation cost is enough to cover the notarisations fees, as long as everyone agrees on this... So if a chain ends up being very popular and notaries collectivly decide to host it and notarise it, they can just accept to be paid 10,000 sat per notarisation, I think we can height activate this for each chain in the code wihtou much issue as I dont see it happening very often. In reality notarisation dont always happen, so they would still get paid some small amount.But its insignificant in the scheme of things. There is still a KMD notarisation cost to be considered,. but if we can self fund this with a KMD notary node OR by selling LABS paid to notaries on the main chain then everything is fine.

[05-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This seems to be the last hurdle to overcome... Defining coin emission so that its a fair as possible while haveing enough built in buying power to make being a ntoary profitable.

[05-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The case of adding or removing notaries can be decided by a stake holder VOTE and airdrop to a vot chain like KMD does.

[05-Feb-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So if there are a lot of stake holder that want to be a notary node they can simply have a VOTE (nothing stopping anyone airdropping a vote chain, and it can be easily verified by others) to increase the number of notary ndoes. Like wise if a notary node is being a bad actor/gone AWOL a VOTE can be taken to remove that notary.

[05-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If a notary decides to step down, that can also be taken into account, I dont think selling ndoes should be allowed, there should be liek a byelection to vote a new node to his/her place.

{Reactions}
💯 

[05-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just some tahughts for you guys to think about. Likey we can change thigns as we go along as long as a vote is held for changes. Likely an easy way to handle votes should be created as a project of the LABS project along the line, or maybe if Verus solution is finishd by then we just use theirs lol.

[05-Feb-19 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`komodod -ac_name=LABS01 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1 -ac_algo=verushash11 -ac_staked=20 -ac_notarypay=36000`
If my math is correct this chain would cost ~1200 LABS to last an entire year, with 1000 of that being held by the chains creator to stake on the chain, they can recover this for something else at any time. The other 200 is paid to notary nodes for ntoarisation, mayeb 200 LABS a year is too low, but I think its the minimum viable amount., with 20 notaries.

The staked value only needs to be very small, likely the 1000 LABS to start the chain will not even need to remain on the chain long term, its up to the chain creator to do whatever they like here. Once the chain has no stakers it will simply stop moving and can be removed from the cluster, as per my proposal for handling this. Also we have a way to add a chain to a banned list, if a VOTE decides that a chain should be dropped OR  bug effecting coin emission is found. Notaries can just stop notarising a chain if they see fit to do so I guess as well.. 
If notaries stop notarising then the chain is effectivly no longer fungible... There is not really any way to enforce this this, it will be up to each notary. Hopefully they all keep notarising everything if they can. A vote can be had to remove or add notaries at basically any time (maybe min 2 months since last vote, as to not happen too often and cause problems and waste ppls time)

[05-Feb-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can still use a "top notarisations" metric to determine each 2 months the bottom notaries, and there can be a vote of all stake holders on weather someone needs to be removed and if we need to increase the number of notary nodes.

[05-Feb-19 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught about genies idea, and while tis possible to get a count of who is in recvmask the most, its not releavent, as the total number of notarisations will be exactly correlated with that.

[05-Feb-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a test of the main chain must be done, to amke sure that it works, if this works and we have a set of defined rules in place we can launch quite soon.
We also need to test ac_notarypay does not break MoMoM so with the main chain test, and he current LABSTPAY chain we need to run migrate loops for a few days while logging fails. It doenst need to be full blocks or anything, just 1 export in each block, like earlier tests. I think I can probably set up a VM to do this on my own, but more ppl testing provides better data.

[05-Feb-19 10:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if votes are more than yearly, it's be cool to have a pledge system. Users designate their vote stake to a notary (or group of notaries), changeable after locktime expiry of 2 months or so. That way no crypto-citizen misses out on sufferage through absence, and voting isnt a constant obligation. set and forget until a notary pisses you off or makes an impression - then reallocate.

[05-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its more there just incase a notary with very high counts is doing something everyone does not like... And we can always increaes the amount of nodes... but notaries are not going to like that because it means they get paid less... So it ahs to be up to all stake holders.

[05-Feb-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a valid vote chain would be something like > 30% of stake weight voted and an outcome was reached....

[05-Feb-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not its just ignored...

[05-Feb-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think a set election is viable, every 2 months

[05-Feb-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they should only happen if something needs to change.. Trust worthy notaris are very important to this type of blochchain, chanign them often leads to issues, but adding more seems fine if the demabnd is there for people to want to be one.
