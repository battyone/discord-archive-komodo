@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I signed up on dragonhound.tech but confirmation email never arrived and I can't login.  Maybe I went dyslectic and mistyped my email.  Please check when you have time.  Thanx.

[21-Dec-18 02:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thanks for letting me know. I've confirmed it manually, try logging in now.

[21-Dec-18 02:52 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
geez, it's not easy not being suspected of being a spammer, even if the only emails I send are requested confirmations :/

I've got a really shitty setup and it uses squirrel for GUI LOL

[21-Dec-18 02:58 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I read up a while back but then did other things

[21-Dec-18 03:00 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I only setup on mailgun to make SPF / DKIM etc easy, but too stingy to pay so shared IP = some domains deny entry 😦

[21-Dec-18 03:00 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
guess I have my weekend task sorted

`Can I modify my box after / use my box for something else too? (Advanced.)
    No. Mail-in-a-Box must be installed on a fresh machine that will be dedicated to Mail-in-a-Box, and you cannot modify the box after installation (configuration changes will get overwritten by the box’s self-management).`

I scabbed a google pixel

[21-Dec-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and stupidly put copperhead OS on it in a rush before I left town... so my phone cant have apps or be a hotspot

[21-Dec-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤦

[21-Dec-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just got some internet

[21-Dec-18 03:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be worse. I know a bloke who bought one, ordered an otter case online, and dropped it smashing the screen day before case arrived

[21-Dec-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-Dec-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im still lost as to what happened to my S5 ... the entire screen is black despite it not being wet or having a single crack

this pixel should be ok ... I think it has no speaker ... it got smashed by my volvos s80 boot and I double sided taped an ebay screen into it ... speaker is broken for phone calls. its like a smart dumbtphone... it does text messages and has an internet browser... usless!

[21-Dec-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still has 0 UTXOs on most chains ☹_

[21-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its actaully ok to just use Liniage and remove GAAPS and then install microg .. this copperhead OS version i have has that ... its like emulates the Play Services and spoofs everything so all the apps still work... but I dont have a play store on this phone to install them with 😦

[21-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to send balance to self

[21-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the new utxosplitter should do it for you

[21-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a-team is working ok with it

[21-Dec-18 03:21 PM] CrisF#3405
That's ok @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , 3 of them are dead atm 😃

[21-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are stalled ?

[21-Dec-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you need to send balance to self`
they are stuck waiting on 2+ confirms
rawconfirmations are good, but confirmations are all at 1

[21-Dec-18 03:22 PM] CrisF#3405
all except CFEK

[21-Dec-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are validly invalid and invalidly valid

[21-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhhh

[21-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait

[21-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no the script waits for only 1 comfirm

[21-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-Dec-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it clearly says `-lt 1` whcih is 0

[21-Dec-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can you make a PR with that ?

[21-Dec-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you could even merge it yourself

[21-Dec-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if not I can try to do it ... but not sure I have intenet for long

[21-Dec-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If it works ... without ppl consantly complaining ... then we want it 😄

[21-Dec-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
400 years from  now when all are synced on my local server, I can fix with some manual splits/sends (hopefully)

[21-Dec-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it was all good until james forgot to .gitignore (that's where mine went wonky)

[21-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Excellent ..

[21-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You have write access so it if works just merge it

[21-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how best to do the dep ... you can always add the install command in the `start.sh` script

[21-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how I did these breaksing changes before ...

[21-Dec-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to remeber to remove it

[21-Dec-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once everyone is updated

[21-Dec-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also add it to the `install supernet` script ... so its there for mainnet

[21-Dec-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure

[21-Dec-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-Dec-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he had a lot of changes to the .py stuff that made everything a shit load easier to get working

part of the good/bad part of this setup of scripts is how much is interlinked and interdependent

notarisations by iguana are prefect ... like 99% happening (used to be like 55%) but nearly everything else is screwed
