@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator if you want to make a chain, make a new branch for it, launch the chain and add it to assetchains.json

[03-Mar-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
new branch, so we don't break it while joker plays around with master

[03-Mar-19 11:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
chain is launched...

[03-Mar-19 11:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
guess I can branch it

[03-Mar-19 11:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
in /StakedNotarty, /komodo, or both?

[03-Mar-19 11:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wont need to relauch after branch tho eh?

[03-Mar-19 11:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not in a rush, got 3 nodes staking on it at the moment

[03-Mar-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have some things to work on for the lABS merge upstream. I will not be able to do anything here until that is fixed. Hopefully its nothing hard. Best way is to just `git checkout -b master` 
then add the branch param to assetchains.json.

[03-Mar-19 11:39 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator you launched it with current master branch?

[03-Mar-19 11:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah. 3 nodes tho, some may not have been fully up to date. seemed to work tho

[03-Mar-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
made the branch

[03-Mar-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
ok so do `getnotarysendmany`

[03-Mar-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
use that to send coins to each notary

[03-Mar-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
then put the params in assetchains.json

[03-Mar-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
make sure you include "branch": "CFEKORKL"

[03-Mar-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
then tag staker and tell them to ./start.sh

[03-Mar-19 11:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
sweet thanks.

[03-Mar-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
try it on your notary before tagging everyone 😃

[03-Mar-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
Joker and I have learned that well 😂

[03-Mar-19 11:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
heh I just spent 3 minutes trying to find the getnotarysendmany.py script  😓

no worries... I am testing migrate now, buit I think it can handle a few nodes being down.

Hello KMD labs. I was speaking with @jorian about integrating a new type of consensus algorithm for my own assetchain. What would be the necessary steps to do so?

[03-Mar-19 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
@MCB999 what is it you're trying to do?

[03-Mar-19 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean by consensus algo? The hashing algo?

this goes 'above my hat', hope you can help

[03-Mar-19 07:58 PM] MCB999#4841
Thank you @jorian . I would like to create an assetchain on Komodo. But instead of PoW or PoS, I would like to use HPB's Proof of Performance consensus algorithm as well as their hardware for enhanced scalability and security of my assetchain.

[03-Mar-19 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
I took a look at the website and the git. Is it not actually mining? Just choosing which node to give a block based on some condition? If so, what condition?

[03-Mar-19 08:07 PM] MCB999#4841
To my understanding it isn't mining but more of a consensus algorithm that allows the BOE hardware to perform a number of computing tasks that would otherwise have to take place on the software/chain itself, inherently slowing down the system. It also provides extra security will features such as true random number generating.

[03-Mar-19 08:10 PM] MCB999#4841
Data Fragmemtation, ECDSA Acceleration, Concurrency.

[03-Mar-19 08:12 PM] MCB999#4841
I assume the performance contribution would be the condition, but not sure.

[03-Mar-19 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
I don't quite understand what "performance contribution" means, but you could likely make it work with a cryptocondition if you can clearly define  when a node should and shouldn't be rewarded a block

[03-Mar-19 10:11 PM] MCB999#4841
Thanks for the clarification

[04-Mar-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think after all this messing around I finally understand the actual problem with MoMoM.... its not cool guys...

[04-Mar-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What its doing, is using diffrent KMD heights  to calculate the MoMoM hash for iguana notarizations, and the signing of the import tx on KMD. Its like fatally flawed from the beginning. Im really not sure how to fix it at all.. Seems like the entire thing needs a pretty large redesign.

{Reactions}
😓 (2) 

[04-Mar-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The issue is that when KMD is making the import transaction it uses the height of the notarization on KMD. but iguana just pickes som random number. There is not possible way these two ranges of MoM hashes can always 100% line up.

[04-Mar-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To me, the validation of the import transaction is wrong. Instead of sending the MoMoM hash inside the import itself it should just be verifiing the TXID against the MoMoM hashes....The current way its doing ti is stupid... and makes little sense at all. I've thaught about this a lot... and making the MoMoM hash always line up 100% of the time doesnt seem possible.

[04-Mar-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So the fix I am going to attempt, which should be only a change locally on how it validates, at least for now. the import wont propagate the mempool. ... but if I cna get it to validate then I can push another update.. Not sure what would happen to existing chains, so I would say newones need to be created to test it.

[04-Mar-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is likly to slow don the validation to a crawl ... as its going to need to loop fer a range of blocks, trying to verify the txid against all the MoMoM proofs until its gets the one that passes. This is how I thaught it was actaully working in the first place, but I know know this to not be the case... Its just looping the notarizations looking for a matchins MoMoM hash... which quite simply it will never always find, because there is 0 chance that they are always exacrly the same.

[04-Mar-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The 2 calls to Calcualte Proof Root MUST have the same input to get the same output. If this differs, its never going to work.

[04-Mar-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe the call to Calcualte Proof Root can somehow, be standardized so that they always take some exact range...

[04-Mar-19 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesnt seem possible to make it validate like that, as thats not how it works 😦 
It simply creates the MoMoM hash then compares that its equal ... there is no magical maths invloved really... So we are left with 2 options, using a frequency so large that there is almost 0 chance of something overlapping... like 15 or even 20 blocks... Which could still fail if there was a long block on KMD or the assetchain ...

[04-Mar-19 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or I can try and make it always go backwards on KMD height by 10, and then move forward to the closest multiple of 5 ... This seems liek a simple solution, but in reality notarisations are not uinform enough to make 100% sure every 5 blocks there will be a MoMoM calcualted and sent to the target chain. Really not sure what to do now.

[04-Mar-19 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe some way of redeeming lost burnt coins is the only solution... along with a frequency of 10. and minimum of 5 KMD blocks.

[04-Mar-19 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure what that means to anything else built on top of the cross chain tech, as it seems anything that uses it will fail at some point when it enconters a gap, and not eveythign can use some redeeming contract for lost funds or something.

[04-Mar-19 05:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm looking into storing https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json on an oracle for visual display / twitbotting. Would this help at all with what you're trying to get done?

[04-Mar-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really not sure man, but It seems to be that the MoMoM hash cannot be attached to notarizations if it needs to be 100% reliable ... bu using an oracle means the data is centralised... which is also no good... The only 100% reliaable way to do this is to make the assetchain, RPC directly to a full KMD node to get its MoMoM validation

[04-Mar-19 05:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is just not a solution at all either... This is really shit... I dont understand why it was done this way... doesnt seems like this is how it has been expalined that it works at all.. It cheating and thus broken.

[04-Mar-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either that or I'v never understood what Im working with here. I know that it worked 100% of the time with a freq of 15 before sapling broke the propagation of txns though the mempol.

[04-Mar-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
After sapling the KMD chain just doesnt mine transactions reliably ... not sure why, and cant work that out. Its on KMD so has nothing to do with mempool changes for CC chains.

[04-Mar-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Having to deal with this problem, has shown the flaws with this system.. it made way too many assumptions to be a reliable consesus validation.

[04-Mar-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it needs a bigger hammer 🔨

[04-Mar-19 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we just force it to notarize all the time and bail on each notarizaiton when it doesnt have the required data, it may magically work.

[04-Mar-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So we need to use a freq of 5 KMD blocks, with a freq of 1 on the LABS chains themself. So it will just try and notarize every single block, but exit the round if 5 KMD blocks have not passed, and MoMoM hash is null.

[04-Mar-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This will ALMOST guarentee that a notatzation happens every 5 KMD blocks,.

[04-Mar-19 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then we can try and standardize the MoMoM hash calcuation to every 5KMd blocks, it must scan forwards to the first multiple of 5 blocks on KMD.

[04-Mar-19 06:58 AM] jorian#4555
so the issue is sapling?

[04-Mar-19 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really lol, that just doesnt help the situation. The issue is that 2 notarizations can be confirmed in the same block

[04-Mar-19 06:59 AM] jorian#4555
and a bug  concerning MoMoM?

[04-Mar-19 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on KMD this is

[04-Mar-19 06:59 AM] jorian#4555
oh

[04-Mar-19 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that breaks everything... increasing the frequency to a much higehr number should help the situation ... but it wont help always

[04-Mar-19 07:01 AM] jorian#4555
well that tx propagation issue in KMD is something i noticed too

[04-Mar-19 07:01 AM] jorian#4555
and then mining them

[04-Mar-19 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly does happen ... no idea why. Alright also noticed it.

[04-Mar-19 07:02 AM] jorian#4555
so now we're going to work with something that is inherently broken?

[04-Mar-19 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should be able to be fixed ... but its really not going to be easy or fast

[04-Mar-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to work out exactly what edge case is doign it, then prevent that frmo happening ... then increase freq out so that the edge case doenst happen very often. 
We can just sledgehammer the KMD sign setp to use a range of KMD heights, becasue one of them has to have a MoMoM returned that iguana has placed in a ntoarization.

[04-Mar-19 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so if it fails for over an hour, go abck a step and add a block to the kmd height ... keep doing this until it passes valdiation

[04-Mar-19 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
technicallty this will work.... but its not a very nice solution

[04-Mar-19 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we slow it down, so that it doesnt happen much if at all, unless some extremly rare case where there are either no blocks or lots of blocks in some time period.

[04-Mar-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
brainstormed some ideas and just one of the approaches needs to work. the first step is to get it 100% reliable at slow speed, then and only then to speed it up

[04-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
Thanks for details  @blackjok3r 
There’ll be a way to fix it.  If p2p orderbooks had a solution this will have one.

[04-Mar-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just working backwards from known problems

[04-Mar-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one thing at a time. There is a solution, its just not easy to find, and cannot be complicated or it wont work.

[04-Mar-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So far, I have nul MoMoM theoretically sorted.

[04-Mar-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to test it on iguana side though to make sure.  Solution was very simple there in the end, just had to think about it for long enough.
