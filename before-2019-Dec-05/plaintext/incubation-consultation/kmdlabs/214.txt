sms alerts almost implemented. shouldve done that earlier :abusedsmily:

[10-Jan-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice

[10-Jan-19 12:35 PM] CrisF#3405
He's a good test case 😃

[10-Jan-19 12:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, definitely exposes the flaws 😝

[10-Jan-19 12:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
red teams my fence regularly

[10-Jan-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
HOLY CRAP! Blocks are waaayyyy too fast atm ...

[10-Jan-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Target is working great now though

🥓 

[10-Jan-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when its trying to find the peoper% though wow.... 1-3s block times.... PoS and PoW fighting who can mine first

[10-Jan-19 12:58 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thats mental!

[10-Jan-19 12:58 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how long to equilibrium?

[10-Jan-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im a bit confused by it tbh ...

[10-Jan-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I remeber about this way back in PoS test ... I think it might take a few thousand blocks.

[10-Jan-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its holding the target quite well atm.... but it keeps minign its PoW blocks in large blocks really fast ... so what happens is it mines super fast in chunks then slows down... I think it might be ok... I havent crashed or forked anything so far

[10-Jan-19 01:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
should I mine or not? idle right now, but fast blocks sounds "lucrative"

[10-Jan-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is a test chain I am using here on my own

[10-Jan-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so what happens is it mines super fast in chunks then slows down... `
I think that's because at target the diff takes a super high jump (eg 10 to 200k)

[10-Jan-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its ok... just needs more time and more hash rate to equalise ... it was really weird wating it make 80 PoS blocks in a row and % never falling though :S

[10-Jan-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
MGNX still has chunks like that

[10-Jan-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
like 5 in a row seconds apart occasionally

[10-Jan-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
we should get as much data as we can from MGNX over the next couple weeks

[10-Jan-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as I remeber james explaining it was because it takes a 100 block runnign average or something.... but that doesnt seem to make a whole lot of sense ...

[10-Jan-19 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
POS% is based on the previous 100 blocks i think

[10-Jan-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And the code that is detecting PoS or PoW is not what determines the PoS% that comes from somewhere else 🤷

[10-Jan-19 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
the diff and how fast it adjusts is not

[10-Jan-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
MGNX is basically spot on for expected block times, so I'm not really sure it's a problem

[10-Jan-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I dont think it is either ... just seems weird its using two dirrent sets of code to determine it ...

[10-Jan-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
appears to be working ... I guess I need to try and sync MGNX to make sure its not fucked up something... this really should not be consensus code. Its just setting a flag in the block index so it doesn thave to calculate if the block is PoS or PoW every single time.

[10-Jan-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its calmed right down already holding 80% pretty well...

[10-Jan-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so it doesn thave to calculate if the block is PoS or PoW every single time`
How else would you validate the block?

[10-Jan-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This isnt block validation

[10-Jan-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I was confused when It couldnt sync my first chain

[10-Jan-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its setting a flag when it does the block validation

[10-Jan-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I'm confused as to that calculation you're talking about

[10-Jan-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well what I set out to acheive worked ... Guess time to sync MGNX and see if it syncs.... it should 🤞

[10-Jan-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😮 its working

[10-Jan-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
block 5000... who knows what happened before lol

[10-Jan-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is very interesting to watch .... ALLL the PoW blocks do pretty much happen in huge chunks.

[10-Jan-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, part of that is the "diff wall" stops them all but entirely

[10-Jan-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
block 20,000 now its like right ... there is a PoW or 2 scattered around thats it

[10-Jan-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
guess this is when ppl stopped mining it :trollface:

[10-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```on block arrival:
getinfo for -pubkey 
setpubkey for R address 
check coinbase -> R address 
if yes check segid != -1 
if -1 send PoW mined coinbase to either:
        lowest segid balance we have <- wallet dependant may be very slow
        (combine with the smallest utxo we have in wallet?)
    or 
        do getlastsegidstakes RPC <- very fast
        lowest mined segid in X blocks 
        (combine utxo with smallest utxo in this address?)
    exit

if segid >= 0 
    fetch last transaction in block
    check if this tx belongs to an address in list.json 
    if yes, use existing code to combine this coinbase utxo with the utxo that staked it.```
staking script logic to leverage new bug fixes, and alrights existing code.

[10-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  anything wrong with this logic you think?

[10-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@webworker01  what do you think? Its using your code and mine together lol.

[10-Jan-19 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this is for NNs, or gen pop, or what?

[10-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
staking nodes ...

[10-Jan-19 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to manage wallet... if you end up with 50,000 address's it breaks pretty badly

[10-Jan-19 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
errr ummm I stopped using pubkey like 4 months ago 😛

[10-Jan-19 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah.... but without it ... you need to constantly merge address ... and the wallet is proine to breaking, means you can lose all those keys

[10-Jan-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it would seem to me that by the time you hit 50k addresses you should be doing management anyway weight vs time and all that

[10-Jan-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ... I think its better to just let nodes work... This is mostly already written, just ahd to psudo code it before I actaully coded it, as py is pretty new to me.

[10-Jan-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my preference aside, what happens if you use that addy for PoW *and* PoS, I'm not quite sure I follow that bit

[10-Jan-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... the existing script assumes you never PoW

[10-Jan-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but with the fix today getblock returns the segid

[10-Jan-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if its -1 and the coinbase is to your address... then its PoW

[10-Jan-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no dicking around ... I had a bash script that did it... but it was terrible ..about 15 RPC calls to make a desision

[10-Jan-19 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
where does this "-1" segid come from?

[10-Jan-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoW ...
It checks in the daemon when it validates PoW/PoS ... these 2 are in diffrent funntions. I got the segid working a while ago, PoW never worked tho. I found where it actually validates the PoW today, and flagged the segid to -1 like its meant to be and it works.

[10-Jan-19 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you know 100% if the segid == -1 the block was PoW (even if it has a phantom staking tx in it) no longer need to check difficulty and all that as we used to before in POSTEST

[10-Jan-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, block validation ignores the actual segid and pretends it's '-1' ?

[10-Jan-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no ... its hard to explain ... the blockvalidation is spagetti

[10-Jan-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry

[10-Jan-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its ok

[10-Jan-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... I cant see how itr would do it any other way

[10-Jan-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
its a messy problem

[10-Jan-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The point is... that it now works... It syned MGNX until blok 170,000 or so

[10-Jan-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then it complained of a fork

[10-Jan-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think related... started with connect= to check

[10-Jan-19 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```json

  "segid": 24,
...
}```
I'm lost after the 24 becomes -1 bits 😛

[10-Jan-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
go get block ? do you see segid = -2

[10-Jan-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
-2 means the flag in pindex wasnt set ... it never was

[10-Jan-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now it is

[10-Jan-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once the block has been verified once .. it sets a flag on the block. saying segid == -1 for PoW or segid > 0 for the segid that staked it

[10-Jan-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔  I think getlastsegidstakes could also easily return the % of PoS over any amount of blocks now aswell 😄

[10-Jan-19 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, so the segid of the *block* and not the address(es)

[10-Jan-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.

[10-Jan-19 04:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess that'd work 1/2way decent for n00bs, then
still think that personal responsibility should be encouraged, but that's just me 😛

[10-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah... I think that if thuis method was not shared ... the people who had it would dominate the staking tbh

[10-Jan-19 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd say you'd have to test it a couple/few times by running 2 nodes side-by-side and comparing the long-term results to avoid confirmation bias

[10-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
true

[10-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we will launch a STAKED4 airdrop chain same as lameducks to serve as the oracle chain I think

[10-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are some exemptions for staking miners, that *may possibly* have issues.... so we should just hit that chain with heaps of massive dependant txns to see

[11-Jan-19 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well the python version that exists doesn't work, alright had a working version. Maybe it was lost...

[11-Jan-19 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The daemon now has information. We didn't have before, so can make some cooler things

[11-Jan-19 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
After 1400 blocks... Its looking pretty good... Difficulty is too high for 2 CPU cores daemon mining... Going to start adding hash rate one GPU at a time... see how much it needs to get back to 80%

[11-Jan-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure if my mining rig even works anymore... I have a feeling I wiped the OS becuse I needed the USB drive 😦

[11-Jan-19 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
if you can explain the problems in that staker.py script I made, I'll fix them

[11-Jan-19 04:18 AM] Alright#0419
it wasn't ever really finished. I pushed that right before my "vacation"

[11-Jan-19 04:18 AM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 the point of doing it in python was to make it compatible with OSX and windows

Just made this, going to use it for any scripts that are stress test specific, so we don't clog up PoS_scripts with things that will never be used again after the stress test

Any requests for scripts, tell me now. Just finished the "scoreboard"

[11-Jan-19 04:43 AM] Alright#0419
might need a couple little tweaks, but it seems to work well

[11-Jan-19 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... 500H/s seems enough to stop PoS from bering stuck at 100%

[11-Jan-19 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats 1 GPU

[11-Jan-19 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think diff algo for PoS is a problem at all. 😃 You just need to actaully mine the chain with anything but a daemon miner

[11-Jan-19 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will work on staking script next, see what I can get it to do.. Your one is a great start, but its slow. Can improve it a fair bit now that segid is wroking for GetBlock.

[11-Jan-19 04:47 AM] Alright#0419
for migration logging to oracle, we just need export txid and payouts?

[11-Jan-19 04:47 AM] Alright#0419
man, I don't see why we don't log this locally and just stress oracles with garbage data

[11-Jan-19 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because thats not what Cris wanted 😆

is each of these a separate oraclesdata?
