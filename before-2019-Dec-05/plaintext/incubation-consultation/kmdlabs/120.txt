[24-Nov-18 11:51 AM] gt#2812
would staking help get it moving?

[24-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not quite sure

idk man MGNX has crazy inconsistent block times

[24-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the streamer iptions changed the miner a lot... but all the PoS stuff was mostly elswhere in the code

[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will need to get statrs node up

[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to check the blocktimes by second and get a log ... I tested all this before and it was always liek this.. the max imum block time sis 384s

[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will stake a bunch of fast blocks

[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then diff wil rise

[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL you just get your node up?

[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it wll stop for awhole until the cut off happens

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
just wondering how long you've been waiting

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once the PoW and PoS battle it out for a few thousand blocks it usially gets better. MGNX is because none mines it with enough hash rate.

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, just 10 minutes ago @Alright

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
I have ~4% of it's supply and I can't be arsed to stake it

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
and it's 90% POS

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jorian#4555
of MGNX?

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jorian#4555
same

[24-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jorian#4555
not worth it

[24-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jorian#4555
MGNX is so ded

[24-Nov-18 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
MGNX best coin

[24-Nov-18 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
bitcoin killer for sure

[24-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jorian#4555
yes so much value

[24-Nov-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
*never had a single coin*

[24-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
it honestly could have had value, but their community decide to keep MGN alive as well

[24-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
they 2x airdropped a 10 sat coin

[24-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
and kept the old coin alive

[24-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
surely they thought "Oh yes, free coins"

This: 
`minsigs = (num_notaries_STAKED[era] + 4) / 5;`
should be this: 
`minsigs = (num_notaries_STAKED[era]  / 5) +1;`
