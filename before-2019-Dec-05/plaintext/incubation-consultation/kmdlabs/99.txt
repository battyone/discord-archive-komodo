and a bunch of other things aswell

[23-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this allows it to know what is going on a lot more than was possible before... if we ever get a working contract for notary payments, it needs this..

[23-Nov-18 09:03 AM] gt#2812
so does mask matter? seems to be notarizing

[23-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maks is probably incorrect

if your gettin messges with MINE in them and utxo are being spent

[23-Nov-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its working

[23-Nov-18 09:05 AM] gt#2812
all good then

[23-Nov-18 09:05 AM] gt#2812
how do you tell who has notarized (as in the first 20)

[23-Nov-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is not that

[23-Nov-18 09:06 AM] gt#2812
yeah i know just curious

[23-Nov-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this was needed to be done before that... so that everyones keys are activated

[23-Nov-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are transacctions so we cna just look on explorer

[23-Nov-18 09:06 AM] gt#2812
oh ha yeah makes sense

[23-Nov-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either that or I can scripts it

[23-Nov-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
currently each notarisation is printing to stdout waht number notary participated in it

[23-Nov-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also the issue of notarisation databses not matching seems to be corrected now that the pubkeys are all the same in iguana and komodod.

[23-Nov-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so MoMoM should be working perfectly again.

[23-Nov-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to wait for era change now, and all restart again.

[23-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
when era change

[23-Nov-18 09:14 AM] jorian#4555
timestamp has passed

[23-Nov-18 09:14 AM] jorian#4555
right?

[23-Nov-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[23-Nov-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its on 0 here

[23-Nov-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
restart iguana

[23-Nov-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to fully stop on one node

[23-Nov-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and just start.sh on the other to test if its working as expected

[23-Nov-18 09:17 AM] jorian#4555
it seems i am trying to notarize, but i dont have cfek*

[23-Nov-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana will notarise ... but the daemon will reject all notarisations until the new era

[23-Nov-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then the iguana if not enough have updated

[23-Nov-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will be producing invlaid notarisaions

[23-Nov-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its imporntant we can get every single node updated inside the gap or close to it.

[23-Nov-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
of course this time... that was never going to happen

[23-Nov-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One of mine restarted ... and its no longer officila notary so it aseems working...

[23-Nov-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all I did was start.sh

[23-Nov-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian I'll re-fund everyone in a minute

[23-Nov-18 09:22 AM] CrisF#3405

[23-Nov-18 09:25 AM] CrisF#3405

[23-Nov-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
I'll need someone available tomorrow when i create the chain(couple hours before 10AM UTC) that has STAKED4 they can stake

[23-Nov-18 09:25 AM] CrisF#3405

[23-Nov-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 09:26 AM] Alright#0419

[23-Nov-18 09:26 AM] Alright#0419

[23-Nov-18 09:26 AM] CMaurice#1685

[23-Nov-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 09:28 AM] Alright#0419

[23-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does anyone need some KMD ?

[23-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant notarise without it.. üòÉ

[23-Nov-18 09:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe which is not enabled by default? I have a default 18.04 ubuntu server install

[23-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  used 18.04 on his ... Did you have this problem?

[23-Nov-18 09:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i don't have bionic/universe, it's not enabled by default

[23-Nov-18 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stakednotary relies heavily on JQ ,... slurm not so much its just for network monitor tool.

[23-Nov-18 09:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r how much KMD per month, will a STAKED notary need, roughly on average?

[23-Nov-18 09:47 AM] zatJUM#9924
My server has been provided with universe enabled

[23-Nov-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool... maybe we need to just add something in instructions to enable universe for 18.04 before installing ?

[23-Nov-18 09:47 AM] Alright#0419
at min sigs 4 the cost of notarizing a chain was roughly 1 KMD a day

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it 5 now

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
will be 4?

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1 KMD goes a LONG way

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
yea

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
weeks if not months

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
some of my wallet address fomr testnet hasv over 50,000 txs

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
used less than 5 KMD total

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
ok, just wondering

[23-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
We hope to get KMD notaries elected to fund it, duke
