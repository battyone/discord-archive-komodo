I just set one up for a couple days entering data.  Thankfully I don't need to connect it to the internet.

@LabsAssistant 
``` Time to try this. No idea if it will work, which is why I am changing port on iguana to 9998. Instructions:
1) sudo ufw allow 9998
2) ./stop.sh
3) ./start.sh -reindex
This is a major update to how MoMoM and dPoW work, the daemon especally for KMD, should use a fair bit less ram now. I dont know if this will fix the migrate problem, but it certainly can't hurt it and remvoes a variable allowing us to test further. 
```

[28-Feb-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The rest of the tests will be on my own branch and node. The plan is to log every tx that iguana sends, then also log every notarization added to the MoMoM database. 
I can then compare sent notarizations with notarizations added to the chain. If this step doesnt show up anything meaningful then I dont know how to fix it. 
If this test shows that notarizations are missing, then we simply need to change the ScanNotarizationsDB function to only return notarizations that are notarized. This prevents reorgs losing notarizations from the chain.,m and means the MoM depth is  reliable to be correct 100% of time.

[28-Feb-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible that somehow notarizations are also being sent more than once. In which case a duplicate MoM hash is being added to the MoMoM hash or something like that 😂

[28-Feb-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Apart from these possible issues, I dont have enough knowledge of the MoMoM process to debug it any further.

[28-Feb-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤞  we find what we are looking for!

I'm up.  Went very smoothly here.

[28-Feb-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it shouldnt be that bad. just make sure everything is actually dead. @CMaurice  if you started before when I was still working on code, you might need to kill -9 komodod
there were many small bugs that got into while true loops and thigns I have fixed since.

[28-Feb-19 11:58 AM] zatJUM#9924
Same for me, up 😃

I think I just found a bug with is_STAKED that could possibly be having an effect on this problem 😂 
oh well seperating MoM from dPoW was a good thing anyway.

[28-Feb-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not 100% sure if everyone needs to update. Dont think its important. just nodes testing migrates need to update KMD.

[28-Feb-19 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[28-Feb-19 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry guys... I think that it requires an update and resync/index of KMD 😦

[28-Feb-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or we need all new chains.

[28-Feb-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks like this was my fault lol... Undefined bahaviour in the switch for which notaries it uses. 🤦

[28-Feb-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not reallty sure if it is the problem, but definatly could affect things

[28-Feb-19 12:42 PM] CrisF#3405
NP, what's the best option?

[28-Feb-19 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still trying to figure that out .... the optimal solutuion is to rewind the KMD chain a few thousand blocks

[28-Feb-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
them reindex all chains again... bot sure we can do that or not though

[28-Feb-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Does anyone have a bootstap of KMD from a day ago or something like that ?

[28-Feb-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
aside from not being on IP list, any idea why notarizations suck ass on local server?

[28-Feb-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No it cant be from today

[28-Feb-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
has to be from yesterday or a few days before that... Myabe my otehr VM is behind far enough to sync it to 97% tehn upload to sever 🤔

[28-Feb-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the last 3 days have been on personal server and not Dallas DC
ping times are negligible difference, so it's not that

[28-Feb-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
uplaod speed

[28-Feb-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe

[28-Feb-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
uplaod is farily important for iguana. When we had testnet I had server here on 1Mbit upload... it would max it out for 2mins on each notarization... so simulated bad pings

[28-Feb-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've got 10M down and 0.5-0.75M up (depending on the day)

[28-Feb-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats prbably it

[28-Feb-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know whats going on here. nota is not happening on new port @LabsAssistant  are you sure you launched start.sh with -reindex? 
I dont think KMD will need reindex unless you re doing migrate, in which case just wait a few hours and it will fix itself.

[28-Feb-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm seeing nothing in logs to indicate that the reindex happened

[28-Feb-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it reindexed for me... in testing

[28-Feb-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`./assets-cli stop`
`./assetchains -reindex` also will do the same thing without having to restart KMD

nope it should just print progress update tip logs until tip

[28-Feb-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
may need manual like you just posted

[28-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Alright#0419
it reindexed for me

[28-Feb-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe git pull before start.sh ?

[28-Feb-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise it wont pass $1 to ./assetchains

[28-Feb-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181

either way, it won't have any negative effect

Not sure about reindex as after ./start.sh I always have to pkill iguana and ./start_iguana.sh
