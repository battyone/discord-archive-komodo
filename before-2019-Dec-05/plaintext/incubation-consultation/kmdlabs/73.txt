to count how many failed

[05-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`cat FAILED |  wc -l`

[05-Nov-18 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, great!  A run of 99 from `ING` to `LF` has none.  I'll check through the other nodes.

[05-Nov-18 08:44 AM] CrisF#3405
I have a better distribution of coins now so I can do a few big runs.

[05-Nov-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only fails I am seeing aare from failed export (my nCFEK had no utxo it could use) or from MLT around the times, when it broke.

[05-Nov-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see libacotts fix breaking anything, but also the chains without it are doing ok .. I think if I can work out how to fix the prints, we will just use it anyway to make 100% sure things cannot be broken no matter what.

[05-Nov-18 08:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool.

[05-Nov-18 08:47 AM] CrisF#3405
I haven't done any on MLT.  Should I try that also, or are the other 4 enough?

[05-Nov-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can try if you want, I had issues, but after lowering it to every 45s instead of 30, it seems better, still ahd failed migrates though... maybe the mempool clear has some problems I will need to look at, but Im still trying to finish what I started for STAKED on the weeeked .. very close now. Its a massive update

Staked notaries now have a protection mode, that ignores all TXs sent to their address under a certain size üòÑ

One more thing, should I empty the log file before starting a new run?

[05-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not consensus change... just doesnt add them to the local wallet, so the wallet stays small under a TxBlaster attack

[05-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes .

[05-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will append the next loop to the last file

[05-Nov-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its betst to either move the folder..

[05-Nov-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or delete it if you dont want it

It kind of makes the notaries usless at ANYTHING AT ALL excpet notarising

That might be good for other chains that join the cluster to do their own testing.

[05-Nov-18 09:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can you code `return fire` and destroy the attacker?

[05-Nov-18 09:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe via an oracle which activates sleeper sentry nodes?

[05-Nov-18 09:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Countersniper

[05-Nov-18 09:16 AM] CrisF#3405
That's why I was asking about what info  (wallet,ip etc) is available about a 51 attacker in #dev-security.

[05-Nov-18 09:17 AM] CrisF#3405
This might be best discussed in #private-staked  though üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 09:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got a fair bit done with gps. Hardware is solid, though got a bigger battery on order and some tweaks to firmware pending to make more efficient. Data payload  is light, gets to server via curl over 3G. Server encrypts payload with aes256 and writes it to the oracle.  Another script queries the oracle, decrypts it back into into coordinates - only the publisher has the password to decrypt. Only really got the front end to connect to it all, and maybe some bash to py translation.

Has Skrunch worn the collar yet?  I wonder how he/she'll feel about it.

Thanks @Alright your python rpc functions were hella handy.

[05-Nov-18 09:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
He's been wearing it all day while I was waiting for the GPS to arrive, and it's associated with going for his morning walk so he likes it üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 09:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
never seen him try and get out of it

[05-Nov-18 09:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
left it with gps running while at work today, though he's still under house arrest

[05-Nov-18 09:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha

[05-Nov-18 09:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
unti lI finish battery mods

[05-Nov-18 09:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
gotta balance the pouches tho. GPS goes in one, and the empty on ends up riding up onto his back due to the weight. It's not heavy but enough to make a difference. I tried to balance the other side with some drill bits in tupperware but then that was too heavy got I didnt weight it.

[05-Nov-18 09:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Is there much work on the hardware side to be done?

[05-Nov-18 09:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Gonna try the temple of doom trick with a bag of rice later.

`MLT` hasn't been getting connections for me.
Finally got one and `./start.sh` got up to this point and has stopped there for a while.```CFEKMLT IS A STAKED CHAIN and is era 1
OS_loadfile null size.(/home/cf/.komodo/CFEKMLT/komodostate)

[05-Nov-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try to resync it ?

[05-Nov-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
delete it from .komodo and start again ..

[05-Nov-18 10:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll give it a go.

[05-Nov-18 10:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, that server is doing a run of migrates.  I'll wait till that goes through.

[05-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Mylo#8306
hey @blackjok3r -  @dukeleto said in #dev-general he wants some raw hex from iguana notarization tx to re-use in automated testing.  have you got some print outs available or could make some available some time this week?

[05-Nov-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Imreally not 100% sure how he plans to make a set of valid notarisations ... I guess we can make a chaing from scratch and notarise it for 100 blocks or something

[05-Nov-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then regtest will need to be that exatct same chain every time

[05-Nov-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
down to block hash

[05-Nov-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
possibly even transactions

[05-Nov-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really seems like you cant do it to me... just fake the notarisation

[05-Nov-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
say it happened when it didnt

[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Bit of a random question, can a notarization be encrypted?

[05-Nov-18 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what you mean

[05-Nov-18 12:42 PM] CrisF#3405
Can the data notarized to the KMD and BTC chains be encrypted so the only people who can know what it is are the chain with the key to decrypyt it?

[05-Nov-18 12:43 PM] CrisF#3405
(no one apart from holders of the decrypt key would know what the data is)

[05-Nov-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarization cant happen if thats the case as nodes who are not the holders cant see the notarisation so it not valid

[05-Nov-18 12:52 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.  I'll think about it a bit more.

[05-Nov-18 12:54 PM] CrisF#3405
And do some re-reading.

[05-Nov-18 03:02 PM] gt#2812

I just got the miner working with notarisations = MAX_PRIORITY

[05-Nov-18 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This means that unless someone goes into the daemon code and removes this, and then mines ALL of the blocks... even under maximum full block conditions notarisations will be confirmed in 1 or 2 blocks.

[05-Nov-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also have wallet code working, that auto activates if the node is running with a STAKED notary -pubkey.

[05-Nov-18 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This code, rejects all txs under a certain size, so under txblast the notary nodes just ignore it... and you can start the deamon without your -pubkey, recan and z_mergetoaddress alll the free money, or just do that on another node, leaving the notary to notarize.

[05-Nov-18 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you asked for it @Alright  and i worked it out. Staked notary nodes are now immune to dwy attack! üòÑ

but still not 100%

[05-Nov-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Got a strange error on migrates too ... CFEKING has a string of them (all at the same time) that all say that the momom could not be found, which  is the normal error you get if the notarisation has not been confirmed... I wonder if there was no block on that chain for over an hour, and the tx was lost ü§î

[05-Nov-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This happend hours ago, so it cant be that it just was not confirmed yet.

[05-Nov-18 08:55 PM] CrisF#3405
@@blackjok3r #3181 I have that to I think. Over 1000 ING - >KLF.  Only had a few seconds before heading out. Saw no failure and random log showed complete. No funds on KLF.

[05-Nov-18 09:00 PM] CrisF#3405
Where did you see the momom error?

[05-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Alright#0419

@Alright @blackjok3r  Hi, I can confirm that I had the receiving address imported into both chains.
No `failure` log.
1327 transaction logs with a random selection ending with `Create import transaction sucessful!`
No funds received on KLF.

[06-Nov-18 07:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Stats script on NN shows approx. half the number of notarizations on `ING` (sending chain) as there are on others (except for MLT, which has been feked for me).

[06-Nov-18 07:34 AM] CrisF#3405
I might have found the problem though.

[06-Nov-18 07:36 AM] CrisF#3405
I have I don't have the ING daemon running on the receiving node.  All others are, apart from the dog, MLT.

[06-Nov-18 07:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Will start daemon and hope for a rain of KLF.

[06-Nov-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Create import transaction happens on the chain  sending from, the next stop is the part on KMD, its not able to get past that point, either KMd is not running or its the wrong version.

[06-Nov-18 07:57 AM] CrisF#3405
I have KMD running on both and both chains have successfully done migrations.

[06-Nov-18 07:58 AM] CrisF#3405
I will do a single from each to a different chain to confirm.

[06-Nov-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am only doing from CFEK to each other chain, as a contraol first... 5000 migrates completed

[06-Nov-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just checked CFEK->CFEKED and CFEKLF no failed migrates

[06-Nov-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im thinking at this point we just take libscotts sledgehammer code, and merge it in to master. Its not causing any issues that I can see, and make a failed migrate almost 0% ... Need to investigete what happened on MLT and ING  though.

[06-Nov-18 08:13 AM] CrisF#3405
I did 5000 from CFEK to CFEKING.
