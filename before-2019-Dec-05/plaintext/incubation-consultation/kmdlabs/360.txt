Hi @blackjok3r üëã

[27-Apr-19 05:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Hey man, sorry, been stuck on something here and not tried migrating yet.

[27-Apr-19 05:58 AM] CrisF#3405
kmdlabs.io is redirecting here.

[27-Apr-19 05:58 AM] CrisF#3405
What happened when you tried?

[27-Apr-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
migrate script is now working üòÉ started a loop of 2000

That should have.  Was a week ago or so.

[27-Apr-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly have the other site here, .com and .io are diffrent sites

[27-Apr-19 06:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Need to get this RAID thing sorted so I can free up some space for migration vms.

[27-Apr-19 06:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Anyone else having trouble with kmdlabs.io no redirection?

[27-Apr-19 06:01 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

Out

[27-Apr-19 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well. I got this 2000 loop going, ifg memory servers me correctly it took about 24-36H to complete that many in th past with 1-2 per block. Just testing for gaps again. So hopefully can get it running constantly for a week or longer

[27-Apr-19 06:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool üëç

[27-Apr-19 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
while im working on paymentsCC I can just leave it running. Now the script can resume all started migrates, even if computer freezes or power goes out I cna restart later üòÉ

[27-Apr-19 06:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Please let me know if there's anything for the site.  I'll have  a bit of time after figure out how do break up this array.

[27-Apr-19 06:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you know how I can stop the swap on the drives so `mdadm --stop` can get passed ```mdadm: Cannot get exclusive access to /dev/md1:Perhaps a running process, mounted filesystem or active volume group?
``` by any chance?

[27-Apr-19 06:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Spent a few hours on this so far...

[27-Apr-19 06:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Unable to mount drives for same reason.

[27-Apr-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no man, I used hardware raid on my server, that was hard enough. Genie I think knows about that stuff, if hes around üòÉ

bneen looping for hours here without issues

[27-Apr-19 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
been a few tx get to backup tx 2-3 before clearing but no failed migrates at all. Seems the code was ported just fine to the new daemon and KMD itself.

Have the new changes been merged over to staked? (or is it dynamically linked - I can't remember).
I haven't updated my secondary nodes for a while (stopped them)

[27-Apr-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm .. I would say that staked repo would need the `StakedModo` folder deleted then re run `buildkomodo.sh`

[27-Apr-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that should get it up and running. I'm using it on a miing node without issues. But pretty sure it needed a reinstall

[27-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
cool thanks

Tell me about it!  I spent 20 hours over the last 2 days on something like that.
Finally got through it.
Now the next hurdle has arrived :abusedsmily: 
Previous problems seem much smaller now though, so very happy to see some progress.

whats the benefit of a setting the pubkey in runtime?

[28-Apr-19 01:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Don't need to re-start the daemon I'd say is a big one.

[28-Apr-19 01:32 AM] Exile13#4458
like as if you were setting up multiple servers and you didnt remember?

[28-Apr-19 01:32 AM] Exile13#4458
ya

[28-Apr-19 01:33 AM] CrisF#3405
You can only do that once, unless things have changed.

[28-Apr-19 01:33 AM] Exile13#4458
restarting the daemon forces a rescan of some sort?

[28-Apr-19 01:33 AM] Exile13#4458

[28-Apr-19 01:35 AM] CrisF#3405
For NN it is important to keep daemons and iguana running as much as possible.  It effects your notarization count.
