you're trying to do a sprout tx on a sapling chain

[15-Dec-18 03:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so buildkomodo will fix?

[15-Dec-18 03:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it does a git pull, then yes it should

Congratulations @KomodoPlatform  Ecosystem and community for the biggest hardfork event going smoothly and upgrading to Sapling simultaneously. Biggest day in Komodo project's history. 🤩😎

I am working on it

[15-Dec-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
our superNET was woefully out of date

not looking at any problems on my node @blackjok3r

[15-Dec-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev`

[15-Dec-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then `start.sh`

[15-Dec-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should fix the last of it. cant know until most update ... might need to change the port aswell...

[15-Dec-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but for us is less of a problem.

[15-Dec-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still doesnt appear to be working

[15-Dec-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not recognising `"sapling":1` in the coins file.

[15-Dec-18 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
did I mess up the syntax?

[15-Dec-18 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
is the file looking correct?

[15-Dec-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to move it to the end like deckers, just rebuilding now

[15-Dec-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will let you know

[15-Dec-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I merged dev iguana inot ours, and removed the staked execption as MoMoM is active for eeryhting... we are pretty much equal with main net iguana at this point tI think, apart from a few optimisations and autosplit being removed.

[15-Dec-18 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
I just added it to: char *iguanafmtstr =, in komodo_utils.h

[15-Dec-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... I found that .. you put it in the middle of it, not sure it matters, but deckers commit had it at the end of the string.

[15-Dec-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I am trying that

[15-Dec-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
takes a very long time to restart here....

[15-Dec-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sapling komodod loads much slower.

[15-Dec-18 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is json, position shouldnt matter

[15-Dec-18 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I realise this, but Im not sure what else it could be

[15-Dec-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will spend a bit more time on this, then I have to go look after kids, they have been yelling at me all morning.

[15-Dec-18 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK think its just that my node is the only one on sapling, and hasnt participated in a notarisation

[15-Dec-18 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  You can now update please install libsodium : `sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev` and run `./stop.sh` and `./start.sh`

[15-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your looking for prints of `tx-overwinter-active` to change to something like `mandatory-script-verify-error`

[15-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if that happens everything is fine, juts need to wait until all nodes update.

[15-Dec-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
our komodod might also need another change... for version number checking now

[15-Dec-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope all is well. Will be back later on, hopefully its all sorted out

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator how muck disk space do you have on a node?

[15-Dec-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure that helps for anything... The issue is iguana that stops notarisations I'm just out but there is no one here and its fucking hot so going home soon and will have a good look through diffrenecrs of official supernet to ours, so if can fund anything

Yeah 👍

We can change the port... but there isnt a lot of diffrence... wait a day and it will be updated ... secuity isnt a factor on a testnet.

need to let mining nodes run a day or 2 as it is to make sure the mempool fix is good.

[15-Dec-18 06:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Will be a good chance to see how long it takes for the network (NNs) to self-correct, haha.

[15-Dec-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its in FSM but only tested my myself... all I did was spam full blocks od txs until it locked... and hten kept changing hte locks in the code and a few other things until it stopped locking up, might still do so in real world situation.

[15-Dec-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Main net was fixed as soon as we changed port ... if that was done at the same time as hard fork, there would ahve been les than a 1H gap in notarisations.
