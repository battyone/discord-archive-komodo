run that

[08-Oct-18 01:19 AM] CrisF#3405
This won't be like the `dicelist` 2 minute print out will it?!  
üòú

[08-Oct-18 01:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Try now...

[08-Oct-18 01:30 AM] CrisF#3405
üéâ  Wow!!

[08-Oct-18 01:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Very cool!

[08-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
idea to to have notaries subscribe to who they find trustworthy, if you can get enough notaries to subscribe to you, you can create chain, fund notary addresses and push a new assetchains.json, notaries will see it, build branch(if necessary), sync and start notarizing

[08-Oct-18 01:35 AM] Alright#0419
not 100% sure it will flesh out exactly as stated though, there's a lot of security concerns in doing this

[08-Oct-18 01:37 AM] CrisF#3405
So, someone can basically become a freelance notary?

[08-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
not the plan, no

[08-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
idea is so that joker or I don't unilaterally control what chains can and can't be on the cluster

[08-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
power goes to the notaries

[08-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
don't plan on notarizing anything but STAKED chains

[08-Oct-18 01:41 AM] CrisF#3405
I see üëç

[08-Oct-18 01:43 AM] CrisF#3405
So I should think of it more like adding a coin to BD?  But for notarizations instead.

[08-Oct-18 01:45 AM] Alright#0419
if you can get min sigs number of notary to agree(shouldn't be easy, should be well-respected well-trusted community members) to notarize whatever you push to your oracle feed, you can add chains to the cluster with ease

[08-Oct-18 01:46 AM] Alright#0419
notaries won't have to do anything, as soon as their nodes sees the oracle feed updated, they will start syncing the chain then start notarizing

[08-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hey I am here

Howdy

[08-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just read everything

[08-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I meant by password was bugged

[08-Oct-18 01:47 AM] Alright#0419
still working on the cron to grab the latest oracle data

[08-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Was that if you set a password the print out is all fucked up,

[08-Oct-18 01:47 AM] Alright#0419
but pushing json on chain and retrieving is ready

[08-Oct-18 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
oh yea, that's expected

[08-Oct-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will play with it some more today

[08-Oct-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also setting a message shorter than the previous message

[08-Oct-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
means that the new one is ther with the remaining part of the last one at the end

[08-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I managed to "fix" the fucked up print out, but then the key is also shown twice, seems just an issue with the strings, so hopefully I can "cut" it

[08-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if you dont use password, everyhting is fine

[08-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think password is kind of needed for a chat app though

[08-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you cant get it from mempool

[08-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw

[08-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it segfaults

[08-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
can get oracle data from mempool üòõ

[08-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
james did say that oracle would replace KV

[08-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
after playing with it for the past two days, I finally realized when jl says oracles is the new KV, he freaking means it

[08-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
basically a more robust KV

[08-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so am I stll making this TROLL chain then?

[08-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess seems I started it

[08-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
may as well finish it... but I am not sure how to fix password

[08-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
jspook says he's working on it with his own chain

[08-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
says he has messages working from mempool with some python

[08-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed the prints in our branch

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
LIZ chain

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so remove branch

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wasted my time üòõ

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
Nah, man just leave

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
we can use it to test separate branches thing

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
there are a couple consensus rules changed in it, so it's a good candidate

[08-Oct-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
also, it would be useful

[08-Oct-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool... I'll finish off what I made and just disable password all together so it works properly...

[08-Oct-18 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
very useful, waiting for txs to confirm eats up my time lol

[08-Oct-18 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
the static diff thing that is

[08-Oct-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that was SUPER easy

[08-Oct-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
if there are any contracts that need immediate confs, they can use that

[08-Oct-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
isn't secure until dpow though

[08-Oct-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
also needs 0 block reward or to not be fungible

[08-Oct-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r After tomorrow I'll be MIA until Sunday

[08-Oct-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
anything you need?

[08-Oct-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think so if you have the oracles working I can start testing that

[08-Oct-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will finish off KV branch shortly and create a new chain. How loong will you be around today?

[08-Oct-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
hour or two

[08-Oct-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
"today" in your sense, I'll be back later

[08-Oct-18 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
oh just realized the `tr -r '/'` isn't necessary

[08-Oct-18 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclessamples 01c542e1c65724007b2a42d16d4b8a7b5d38acdc6e3be190f14f9afd1449a160 708dadc8640fd8d8e26cc41b6762166fb76475bd255566eb0a0bf09baec755a2 1 | jq -r '.samples[0][0]' | jq` is enough

[08-Oct-18 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
second jq isn't necessary either unless you want it to be pretty

[08-Oct-18 02:19 AM] wookie#7663
I read through this channel today and although I'm not a programmer, looks like some really cool and interesting ideas you guys are putting together! I'd like to help if I can, I don't know how to code, but I'd like to chip in with a node to help test stuff if you guys need one! @Alright @blackjok3r

{Reactions}
üëã 

[08-Oct-18 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries. There is plenty of testing to be done. We use a cluster of chains rather than just 1. But to test things you can sync just the chains you want.

[08-Oct-18 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think another thing I might need to create is a nice easy script to sync specifc chains from assetchains.json

[08-Oct-18 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For people to test with

[08-Oct-18 02:22 AM] wookie#7663
Yes, step by step instructions if possible please!

[08-Oct-18 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
one of the purposes of staked is to push people to learn new things

[08-Oct-18 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
we can't give you step by step instructions on how to be creative üòõ

[08-Oct-18 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
think of something you want to try and try it

[08-Oct-18 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
and we'll help you along the way

[08-Oct-18 02:29 AM] Alright#0419
@wookie if you want to run a notary on the testnet, we can give you a key to use and walk you through how to do it

[08-Oct-18 02:30 AM] Alright#0419
at some point, we'll be changing keys and you can generate your own and we'll add it

[08-Oct-18 02:34 AM] wookie#7663
@Alright thanks. I'd be interested in trying that!

[08-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
ok, I'll send you one of the test pubkeys that is already in the code

[08-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
have to figure out which one is still available, hold on

[08-Oct-18 02:50 AM] jspook16#3059
@Alright @blackjok3r  I should have added joker to the other messages. I got something working in python. it needs tweaking but im able to send messages across nodes. Let me know if you guys want to take a look at it. Im no coder so dont expect efficiency or beauty.

[08-Oct-18 02:52 AM] jspook16#3059
I dont have a github yet so i'd have to send you the code somehow

[08-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats ok, I was working in the KV.h code, to try and make it just print chat logs directly to stdout, but making it print from mempool crashed the node

[08-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you way is probably better, and doesnt requre diff branches

[08-Oct-18 02:54 AM] jspook16#3059
Im able to do it on LIZ which i made a 50% POS and 50% POW

[08-Oct-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are you able to use the password on KV?

[08-Oct-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found it to besically be broken

[08-Oct-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless it was somehting  I broke by accident

[08-Oct-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
it's not broken

[08-Oct-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
the print in stdout is broken

[08-Oct-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
if you do kvsearch it will show properly

[08-Oct-18 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
which is the intended way to use kv

[08-Oct-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh that helps

[08-Oct-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I might be able to find what exact data kvsearch is using and make it print that instead

[08-Oct-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah i give up trying to use the stdout.... it will only print the correct values from the last update, when using password,

[08-Oct-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will need @jspook16 's version instead.

[08-Oct-18 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL I actually managed to "fix" it

[08-Oct-18 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to remove prints for the miner and it seems it works.
