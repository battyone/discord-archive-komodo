agreed

[27-May-19 05:21 PM] Alright#0419
notaries that are below 25% average notarization count will show as red now in stats.py

[27-May-19 05:21 PM] Alright#0419
that is the metric for who we drop when we change keys btw

[27-May-19 05:21 PM] Alright#0419
below 25% average notarization count

[27-May-19 05:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```int minsigs;
            if (numSN/5 > overrideMinSigs )
                minsigs = (numSN / 5) + 1;
            else
                minsigs = overrideMinSigs;
            if ( pblock->vtx[1].vin.size() < minsigs )```
Alright uggests this as a consensus rule, so that min sigs defined for iguana is the minimum that can be paid for notary pay. Everyone cool with this?

to vote on that thing about 25%?

[27-May-19 05:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
done 😃 man I love this Dappp

[27-May-19 05:44 PM] blubbi#0643
@Alright  that make sense if every notarization is 10 Labs

[27-May-19 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did you read my explination in full?

[27-May-19 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught it was quite easy to follow granted its explaning something quite complicated

Ok I made my poll.. please vote

Lol I am WAY behind on notarisations - just cant seem to get an improvement

[27-May-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah man. I think im im much the same boat... 😦 old servers man they work.... but not great

[27-May-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure your combining the notarisation pay

[27-May-19 06:03 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Hmmm - no utxo to split - am I missing something about these payments?

[27-May-19 06:11 PM] Alright#0419
@blubbi yes, sorry, that's what it is 🤦

[27-May-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
it's 1 LABS per notarization right now until the "slow start" phase is over

[27-May-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Bar_F1sh_Rel  run dwy

[27-May-19 06:13 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It runs on a cron - should have already worked - something else going on here.

[27-May-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that script runs... and tx in mempool it cant split

[27-May-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I keep mine realy far apart

[27-May-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not optmial for preformance but ts safe

[27-May-19 06:20 PM] jorian#4555
oh wow, didn't pay attention to the stats really

[27-May-19 06:20 PM] jorian#4555
but my cheap ass vps is doing just fine

[27-May-19 06:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is it just me or anyone will get his rank printed twice after running stats.py ,like this :
```
Please specify chain: LABS
Please wait...

Lol - block explorer showing a time warp - block 4683 before block 4682 om timestamp.

[27-May-19 06:22 PM] jorian#4555
i have the same

[27-May-19 06:22 PM] jorian#4555
green and normal

[27-May-19 06:22 PM] Alright#0419
Oh must have messed that up when i added the average thing

[27-May-19 06:22 PM] Alright#0419
I added a thing to print notaries that will get dropped as red

[27-May-19 06:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I added this and it worked correcly 
```
    else:
        if k != notaryname:
            print(k, v)
```
just above the last line in the code

[27-May-19 06:23 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel ac_staked is a bit weird

[27-May-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
it perpetually timewarps

[27-May-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
so pos block then pow block afterwards, you might see that

[27-May-19 06:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - just looking because I am hving issues with LABS tx's being confirmed / mined.

[27-May-19 06:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You guys should try to time warp your staking txns 😉

[27-May-19 06:38 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why I'm so far out ahead in counts btw, the seed nodes are not my NN IP

[27-May-19 06:38 PM] Alright#0419
didn't really do any optimizations either

`pip3 install secrets`?

[27-May-19 06:45 PM] Alright#0419
yea it's built in as of 3.6 I think

[27-May-19 06:55 PM] CMaurice#1685
I have spent the whole of today trying to get this to work on Debian 9, to no avail, did manage on Ubuntu 18.04 yesterday, but can't stake on that machine

[27-May-19 06:56 PM] CMaurice#1685
just create a file stker.conf with [] in it iirc, might be avilable form search

[27-May-19 06:56 PM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 make a file named `staked.conf` with `[]` in it

[27-May-19 06:56 PM] Alright#0419
sorry I keep forgetting about that >.<

never saw that before

[27-May-19 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 I truly have no idea what that is

[27-May-19 07:04 PM] Alright#0419
did you change the shebang?

[27-May-19 07:05 PM] Alright#0419
`Error in `python3.7'`

[27-May-19 07:05 PM] Alright#0419
```
Error in `python3.7'
```

[27-May-19 07:06 PM] Alright#0419
that looks weird because of ` and '

[27-May-19 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
if you do `./python3.7 TUIstaker.py` You'll need to change the shebang in stakerlib.py

[27-May-19 09:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
does anyone know, in term of staking, is there a difference between :
- having 1 utxo of 10 coins in each segid.
- having 10 utxo of 1 coin each in each segid. 
???

[27-May-19 09:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[27-May-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more UTXOs = more available times to stake
each time you stake, you have to wait for that UTXO (technically now a new UTXO) to remature

👍 

[27-May-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
an even  scale of 10 vs 1 might not make much difference, but with larger numbers it does

[27-May-19 09:56 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think I got it , thanks CG

[27-May-19 09:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Yay, looks like we have 12 minimal votes for pricesCC testing funding. Thank you notaries! 😃

[27-May-19 10:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
my LABS notary is underperforming and IDK why...

[27-May-19 10:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
went from 26 notarizations behind dwy to 38 behind since 12 PM EDT

[27-May-19 10:00 PM] TonyL#3577
What servers specs do you have?

[27-May-19 10:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
8GB DDR 3466 8 vCPU on a Ryzen 7 2700X and an M.2 NvMe drive with Samsung Pro level R/W times

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks cool, maybe just unlucky now and have to wait

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
where is it located ?

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] Exile13#4458
I think there's only one nota per block in this slow phase

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it in DC? Maybe connection is slow

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] Exile13#4458
I was number 1 now I'm in the middle

[27-May-19 10:04 PM] daemonfox#6136

What amount of UTXOs do you have in stats?

[27-May-19 10:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, kmdlabs have low amount by default, nevermind

split threshold in LABS is 10

[27-May-19 10:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe you just have to relax and wait 😃 Variance factor matters on low distances + as I noticed from testnet with low minsigs amount there is kinda "waves"

[27-May-19 10:06 PM] TonyL#3577
When you on wave your node rocks, when not - not 😃

is your node located in EU daemonfox ?

[27-May-19 10:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
no

[27-May-19 10:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
SE US

[27-May-19 10:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
16 connections as well so not connectivity it would seem

[27-May-19 10:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill check in on it again later

[27-May-19 10:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
Was a LABS pool published I may have missed it

[27-May-19 10:18 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Mine is EU and has always performed less well than others - but truly dier performance currently 😂

[27-May-19 10:21 PM] PHBA2061#2530
which part of EU is it ?

[27-May-19 10:22 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
As long as I can outrun the 25% and maybe change pubkey next round for a cleaner install - and UK.

[27-May-19 10:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Talking of which - late here. Night all.
