If notaries and miners collude... ort a bug happens and a chain stops dead

[01-Feb-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what do we do?

[01-Feb-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
buy a bigger server 😛

[01-Feb-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that doesnt help the coins on the chain

[01-Feb-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if ther is some way to make sure that this can be solved *if it ever happens* we can launch

[01-Feb-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for me anyway

[01-Feb-19 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
short of hash/stake I'm not sure there's any way *to* deal with a dead chain, but wouldn't that partially/mostly be on the chain's internal ecosystem anyway?

[01-Feb-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is MGNX MGNX's problem ? a-team hasnt notarised that inn 19 days

Well, I have my own thoughts on MGNX, but that aside I don't know why it wouldn't have been notarized in that long

[01-Feb-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt notarise it in that long.... doesnt mean it hasnt been

[01-Feb-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did anyone check? 😹

[01-Feb-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know at leat 2 of those top 3  are using cleanwallettransactions ... which all LABS notaried get free 😄

[01-Feb-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
MGNX was last notarized 3 minutes ago 😛

is counts the best metric ?

[01-Feb-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know that selection is pseudo-random, but is there a way to record if NotaryX was in the possibility of selection? or are they always possible even if they opt not to?

[01-Feb-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
WAIT an MINUTE! 
your idea works....

[01-Feb-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe we can measure best recvmask... right at the end... so the time you take to respond doenst matter

You're going to have to be a tad more specific, I have many of those 😛

That measures uptime

[01-Feb-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it means nodes who are up and dont work get poitns

[01-Feb-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With LABS havin all of the optimizations enabled as default... I donnt see that as such a huge issue

As far as ranking, I'll defer to others so as to not continue beating my dead horse

[01-Feb-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well just use counts? with election at first change 25% top get in... rest fight to death...

seriously.. yes 2 1

[01-Feb-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, then back to what I've said all along, if you notarize 10% of what you could then you rank below someone that notarized 20% of what they could and above someone that notarized 5% of what they could
Anything short of that, imo, rewards people for not notarizing and squarly places the whole thing on nothing but hope that we all stay greedy and are OK with leveling the field for those that do less or are not greedy

[01-Feb-19 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so then... 
1) you must be in recvmask
2) if you get to best, you get extra points

[01-Feb-19 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
makes it much the same as flat counts

[01-Feb-19 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I dunno about "extra points" (I think that might lean towards your "everyone in the same DC" idea)

[01-Feb-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[01-Feb-19 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you get a "bonus" because your DC is faster than mine and that bonus is significant, you can bet that I'll leave the texas DC and switch to one in AUS

[01-Feb-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this the the entire problem

[01-Feb-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If my node is @SHossain's node and every one connects to it... it wil dominate....

[01-Feb-19 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007
my node is off now. because `reindexing` komodo chain 😛

[01-Feb-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but I think that if there's no "extra points" to be had, then that goes away
Most aren't going to go through the motions to make a few extra $, but would if it was a question of keeping job

I refuse to pay rental - so old server at home is what it is. Just hoping it's enough to stay in the running.

[01-Feb-19 04:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That works for now, but when live and many chains, you may need to adapt

[01-Feb-19 04:11 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Why? I can control my resources.

[01-Feb-19 04:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Was going more on the "old server" bit. If you can keep up with local, then more power to you (in fact, I'm going to see how well my server fairs in the coming days)

[01-Feb-19 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
th oldest makes no diff its all  bout connectivity

[01-Feb-19 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`th oldest makes no diff its all`
that's not "entirely" true, once we get above *x* chains threads will matter to some extent

```Goal:    TOTAL NETWORK BENEFIT (security, performance, improvement)

An example (of not one or the other):

numbers and catagories are an EXAMPLE to illustrate the concept.  adjust to reach goals and simplify as much as possible while still reaching goal.



LAB        # LABS-KMD notarizations        top 4

RECVMASK    time in                    top 4

# chains notarized, then # total notarizations        top 3

vote (poll?)    kmdlabs contributions            top 3

distribution    closest to av ping + a little        top 1
 
-------------------------------------------------------------

remaining     race (trial by fire)            top 5```

[01-Feb-19 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`closest to av ping`
Unless there's a measurable impact on the system, then I think that could do more harm than good (in the grand scheme of things), other than that, I kinda like it

[01-Feb-19 04:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator and I talked about that once.

[01-Feb-19 04:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Chatting about a way to work on distribution.

[01-Feb-19 04:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Av ping would lead to the bottom.

[01-Feb-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think that if pings count towards keeping your job, in any way, then joker's fear of everyone being in the same DC will be a realistic thing

[01-Feb-19 04:36 PM] CrisF#3405
+ a little might lead to improvement over time.

[01-Feb-19 04:37 PM] CrisF#3405
For sure.  Didn't someone say worse than data center, but in the same VM, haha.

[01-Feb-19 04:38 PM] CrisF#3405
smk762 put up a formula for working out distance from ping if I'm remembering correctly.

[01-Feb-19 04:38 PM] CrisF#3405
I put ping, but could mean anything related to distribution.

[01-Feb-19 04:39 PM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully something that a little `+` could be added to insentivise improvement.

[01-Feb-19 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`smk762 put up a formula for working out distance from ping if I'm remembering correctly.`
hops and routes would have a measurable impact on that, depending on the server/route I can ping Dallas and NYC with less than 5 ms difference ( or more than 20 ms) and I can drive to Dallas in 4 hrs

[01-Feb-19 04:45 PM] CrisF#3405
I think all 3 of the ideas are correct (total #, total LABS and distribution).  I'm hoping you'll all find a way to combine then with a little synergy 💥  You have a lot of brain power, knowledge and experience to do it with,eh.

[02-Feb-19 03:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
formula was in pad, what's the link again?

[02-Feb-19 03:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically not rewarding fastest ping, but those closest to the mean within a standard deviation

[02-Feb-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
distance from ping is far from exact, but closest to average hops/routes path time does imply some dispersion

[02-Feb-19 03:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe a modifier for ntx * (1/std. dev. from mean)

[02-Feb-19 03:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe something to normalise the ping range too

[02-Feb-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think we should do anything with ping, unless the distribution of nodes becomes a problem.

[02-Feb-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its too complicated

[02-Feb-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There seems to be enough of us running/will run our own hardware... To keep it fairly ok for now... With only 20 nodes I think pings will be less of a problem thatn with 64 btw... And increseing minsigs to say 7 would help it even more.

[02-Feb-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to try and work out a way of preventing a notarisation from reentering the mempool.... if it was flagged as invalid... Its not a great solution.... But at least it stops the miner who mined it trying to mine it again.

[02-Feb-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This should prevent the chani stopping if notaries create invalid notarisation...

[02-Feb-19 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Think I have a better solution... Worked it out when talkign to withAlrightt earlier...

[02-Feb-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Making it so that the amount the ntoaries are paid, increases or decreases if the notarisation is over or above freq.5

[02-Feb-19 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This makes it so that notaries cannot just notarise at freq = 1 and get paid more than they are allowed.... Also This makes the suppky they are paid linear... It not longer vaireis by the amount of sucessful notarisations

[02-Feb-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I managed to get validation, to only look at notarisations that are in position 1, so miners who mine notarisations in the wrong order (by changing the daemon) just make that notarisation invalid... I dont think this is ahuge poroblem, because miners could already not mine notarisations....

[02-Feb-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This removes the entire problem of having a notarisation that is invlid invalidate a block.

[02-Feb-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As it no longer matters if the notarisation is valid or invalid... becasue notaries cannot notarise mroe than freq = 5.

[02-Feb-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is not reason for them to make invalid ntoarisations to get more money... becasus they cant

[02-Feb-19 07:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could someone just spam 5 invalid and then slack off?

[02-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only way to make it do this... is to create invalids all the time... so the last notarized height nbever moves...

[02-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the amoutn they get paid would just always go up

[02-Feb-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they would keep getting paid... but their total counts dont increase

[02-Feb-19 07:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
easily identifiable

[02-Feb-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess its a way for 6 notaries to exit scam
