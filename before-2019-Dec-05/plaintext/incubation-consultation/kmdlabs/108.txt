kolo told me, the notary control scripts should not be inside komodo and SuperNET dir's early on... I agree, this was tmy first attempt at doing that.

did you know that on linux, the horn next to your granddad head is pointing outwards, and on macos it is blasting in your ear?

[23-Nov-18 03:55 PM] jorian#4555
i guess something could be said for both scenarios

[23-Nov-18 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
what I really wanted was old man profile and horn blowing out, but I couldn't find it

@CMaurice delete it's directory, then in assetchains.json remove all the nodes except 103.6.12.112 then do ./start.sh

[23-Nov-18 04:06 PM] gcharang#6833
after the sync is done, do `git checkout assetchains.json`

[23-Nov-18 04:09 PM] CMaurice#1685

Deleting chain data and resync with 103.6.12.112 worked for me. Finally got a notorization.
@blackjok3r Why wouldn't CMaurice be getting a connection?

[23-Nov-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to wallet reset with told method

[23-Nov-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181

`mining on ntoary really fucks them`
Maybe, *someday*, some miner guy will create a public pool just for staked chains.....

[23-Nov-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that actually work.. but its noew priority... a manyal reset sending balance to self is enough

[23-Nov-18 04:21 PM] CrisF#3405

[23-Nov-18 04:33 PM] jorian#4555
motherboards for 2990WX are expensive too

[23-Nov-18 04:33 PM] jorian#4555
it's really for the prosumer

[23-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh the 2700Xwith a cheap Gbyte barod nd 32GB of ram, is fast engouhg for just about anything...
