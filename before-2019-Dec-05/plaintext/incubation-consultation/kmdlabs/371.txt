it was really just intended for serious things, but no reason we can't have fun/stupid polls

[06-May-19 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
this could be reworked to work with any set of pubkeys pretty easily

[06-May-19 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
just saying, maybe it has other use cases

right now it's tagged as VOTET

[06-May-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
I'll change it to VOTE when it's solid

[06-May-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
need to get the format correct before we use it, as changing it could make them disappear

[06-May-19 02:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, my chance to create a blockchain based data collection  business.  Gotta get me `LABbooks.com` while it's still available!

can you vote on one of them, check results then vote again with a different answer

[06-May-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
make sure it doesn't change result

@LabsAssistant NN voting dapp is now in StakedNotary repo. It's a bit rough, but it will suffice for now to do this 20vs22 poll. I'll be touching it up throughout the week. 

to vote:
`git pull`
`./NNvote.py`
select `1 | register to poll` 
select the poll you wish to vote in 
wait until the txid shown after registering is confirmed
select `2 | Vote` and it should be self explanatory from there. 

We plan to use this dapp continually, so I'm going to offer some bounties on bugs. 
5 KMD if you find a dependency that is not included in the README
10 KMD per reproducible crash. You must created a github issue on StakedNotary with exact commands needed to reproduce the crash.
50 KMD if you can change your vote and have the TUI display the new value
250 KMD if you can impersonate someone and vote for them

Please `git pull` and add you vote to the 20vs22 question by `./NNvote.py` then going through options `0`,`1`, `2`

You are also welcome to create your own poll :gem:```
