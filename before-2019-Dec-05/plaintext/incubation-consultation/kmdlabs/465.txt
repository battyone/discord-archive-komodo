`there are no nodes with open ports... not sure how hard that is to understand`
it doesn't appear to be looking for any (the "normal" outputs are absent).. not sure how hard that is to understand

There are no seed nodes for STAKED chains... if the addnode cannot be reached it will just stop

@LabsAssistant 
Major update to StakedNotary and SuperNET. 
This allows us to run dual (or any amount of iguanas really), by setting the ports and branch in assetchains.json. 
I added for now CFEKMYLO chain, which is funded and running on blackjok3r branch of iguana and utxocache branch of komodod. 
To get this working Please do the following:
```shell
cd ~/StakedNotary
./stop.sh
git checkout many_iguana
git pull
./start.sh
sudo ufw allow 8222 comment 'blackjok3r_iguana'
sudo ufw allow 47217 comment 'CFEKMYLO'
```

I finally fixed many long outstanding bugs/annoyances while doing this, so there may be more bugs :abusedsmily: 
The daemons no longer pipe to /dev/null, it is now using screen.  For example: 
```shell
screen -r staked
screen -r blackjok3r
screen -r KMD
screen -r LABS
screen -r CFEKMYLO
```
staked is the branch of iguana notatriing LABS.
blackjok3r is the branch of iguana notarizing CFEKMYLO 
KMD is the KMD deamon etc... 
I was able to make TMUX panes, and load the screens into them. Although the detach hot key no longer works, at least we can now read the stdout. Its been a long time comming.

I think this is perfect for testing new iguana... We can notarize from the exact same servers, with both iguanas at once and just directly compare them. To make adjustmetns to the algo., we add a new chain and iguana.

I think minnodes*2 is way too big to start off with, will drop to minsigs... is hardfork tho so will need another ./start.sh :troll_compadre:

`./start.sh` now?

[20-Aug-19 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
Yes sorry please just repeat `start.sh ` 
I see one bug, where it kills both iguanas when only one needs an update, but its really not important for now. Things should be right.

A reminder, please do not use wallet cleaners etc, right now.. Its using a very crude utxo cache that I will be fixing next. It should "just work" even with 1000 utxos, as long as you dont make transactions,  splits only!

cronsplit unsafe?

[20-Aug-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the utxospliiter.sh is fine... But you can increase the number of utxo and lower the frequency you call it... 
Kind of ridiculous the amount of spam tx we make on every single chain, by having to use stupid low amounts of utxos.

[20-Aug-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had some of the AWS nodes with like 2000 utxos and they were notariing withing the same 10% spread.

```34147e48 ht.130 [0] ips.7 CFEKMYLO NOTARIZE.7 matches.0 paxmatches.6 bestmatches.0 bestk.-1:-1 0 recv.28059 sigmasks.(0 0) senderind.4 state.0 (b38af001 0 0) MoM.d60481025429bfb78d8535b2862614cbddbc9f75b3444b00d6251b29862d6e9c [129]
```
Might be a good idea to explain what this means. 
matches is the amount of nodes that match bestk and recvmask 
paxmatches, is the MoM/MoMoM, This is a good way to see the amount of nodes connected, as its always in consensus 
bestmatches is a matching bestk, recvmask, and bestmask. When it reaches minsigs nodes, notarition happens.
But bestmatches cannot get past -1, until min sigs nodes agree on recmask. As more nodes come online this number increases dynamically each round, then lowers every 30s to  lower number untlil there are enough nodes in agreement, if consensus cannot be reached, due to nodes going offline.
