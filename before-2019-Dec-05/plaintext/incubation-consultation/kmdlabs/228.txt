Yes... without that much the PoS wont work and the chain will stop and die burning the coins.

[17-Jan-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At first it might be quite expensive to make a chain in the cluster, but we will start with 4, that should be enough for quitre some time.

[17-Jan-19 04:49 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess it's possible to make a complimentary grants for a really interesting projects without funding

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They can use CFEK

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or LAB

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its treired... we dont want to le chains with broken CC contracts intothe cluster trust me

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I thought we are talking about LAB only atm

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] jorian#4555
there will be LAB and LABS?

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
More of a lone? If you don't burn coins they can be sold back?

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
LAB != LABS ?

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes read proposal .. its in t2 aprts wouldntfit in 200 discord limit

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] jorian#4555
i thought that was a typo ðŸ˜›

[17-Jan-19 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[17-Jan-19 04:51 PM] jorian#4555
how about a different name

[17-Jan-19 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```int8_t is_STAKED(const char *chain_name) {
  static int8_t STAKED,doneinit;

[17-Jan-19 04:51 PM] jorian#4555
LAB vs LABS is too similar

[17-Jan-19 04:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Agree, it's quite confusing

[17-Jan-19 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats all it is... it cna be changed

[17-Jan-19 04:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe a LAB1 and LAB2

[17-Jan-19 04:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So the main chain is LABS ... but the fungible chains are LAB1

[17-Jan-19 04:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[17-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
LABT1 for tier1 fungible etc?

[17-Jan-19 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
LABT1 is cool - more meaning

[17-Jan-19 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe super mega main chain call LABMAIN ?

[17-Jan-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```int8_t is_STAKED(const char *chain_name) {
  static int8_t STAKED,doneinit;

  if ( (strcmp(chain_name, "LABMAIN") == 0) || (strncmp(chain_name, "LABT1", 4) == 0) )
    STAKED = 1;

    STAKED = 0;
  //fprintf(stderr, "This chain is: %s which is: %d\n", chain_name,STAKED);
  doneinit = 1;
  return(STAKED);
};```

[17-Jan-19 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
To describe it's purpose super clear even on this stage

[17-Jan-19 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh T1 and T2 is cool ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Jan-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEK and LABT2 can have thir own notarise clusters if they want...

[17-Jan-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We just cant let untested things get to the main cluster

[17-Jan-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because it will have CEX listings lol..

[17-Jan-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Will do planned forks lol

[17-Jan-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
After things being well tested on CFEK cluster let's say

[17-Jan-19 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Just need to keep separate branches of everything

[17-Jan-19 05:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes .StakedNotary and staked repos make that easy as pie... I was really annoyed when Alright asked me to make that, but I fgigured it out and it works fine as long as teh make file builds.

[17-Jan-19 05:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Right now we work in master.... but as soon as we launch nothing will be pushed there unless its a hard fork.

[17-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Even consider a keyed Ubuntu repo of realeased binaries.

[17-Jan-19 05:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah master is a project saint grail - should be as clean as possible ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Jan-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not keen on released binaries...

[17-Jan-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we need to trust where they came from too much...Maybe main chain can get KMD to build it, or it can be merged to them, for that we need pubkeys as AC param.

[17-Jan-19 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pubkeys is a 3 dimensoilal array of strings for us ... it could be a JSON... but it far too big to pass on bash argument

[17-Jan-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/blob/master/src/notaries_staked.h
Like everythig in this file should be an AC param ideally

[17-Jan-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe hash it somehow?

[17-Jan-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
And use hash param

[17-Jan-19 05:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Or put this info to oracle and use a batontxid with this data as chain param - something like this

[17-Jan-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe that will work

[17-Jan-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
storing the pubkeys on chain has always been a pipe dream

[17-Jan-19 05:14 PM] TonyL#3577
To use chain with this param you need subscribe on oracle

[17-Jan-19 05:14 PM] TonyL#3577
And then you able to start chain with `pubkeys=batontxid` param

[17-Jan-19 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what about the main chain though? what cahin can we store it on? I see only KMD possible

[17-Jan-19 05:15 PM] TonyL#3577
For sure KMD imo

[17-Jan-19 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep if pubkeys were to be stored on chain it has to be KMD

[17-Jan-19 05:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway this chain should be dPOWed at least

[17-Jan-19 05:16 PM] TonyL#3577
And this batontxid should be in a source code

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜Ž 

[17-Jan-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
If pubkeys changing - new oracle data needs to be pushed so notaries have to build komodod with new oraclesdata in sourcecode

[17-Jan-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
But who will post this data to oracle? There is some consensus needed

[17-Jan-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was just about to say that

[17-Jan-19 05:19 PM] TonyL#3577
This oraclesdata transaction should be signed by M from N

[17-Jan-19 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[17-Jan-19 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my thinking was that the arrays can get larget not smaller... adding o their size doesnt change magic value...

[17-Jan-19 05:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Imo in any case it will be more "kinda decentralized" than commit made/approved by single dev to github

[17-Jan-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if its a external data source too... it can work outs the ERA and only load what keys it needs into ram... rather than all of them

[17-Jan-19 05:20 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess you can convert this array to hex and put to oracle with `D` datatype

[17-Jan-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can

[17-Jan-19 05:21 PM] TonyL#3577
If it's not a problem to decode in komodod code

[17-Jan-19 05:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Or some dAPP module ðŸ¤”

[17-Jan-19 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries_staked << data

[17-Jan-19 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think would work

[17-Jan-19 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Bitn then like the chain needs the other nchain running to start

[17-Jan-19 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Oracles designed to store immutable data on blockchain

[17-Jan-19 05:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
\it kind of defats teh purpose of nhaving all indepndant chains

[17-Jan-19 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Pubkeys is the data which should be immutable and in perfect case stored on blockchain decentralised way

[17-Jan-19 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577
So why not try hehe

[17-Jan-19 05:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It would be ahrd to organise ... but what if every chain in the cluster had the array posted that it needs to use at some blockheight

[17-Jan-19 05:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
signed by a key M of N

[17-Jan-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as it was updated before teh timestampt of height it would know how to continue

[17-Jan-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
komodod is already scanning every OP_RETURN

[17-Jan-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wouldnt slow it down a lot

[17-Jan-19 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
M of N cna be updated to new at each submission

[17-Jan-19 05:26 PM] TonyL#3577
I found a mistake in my previous suggestions. There is a bottleneck of baton hardcoding in a sourcedode

[17-Jan-19 05:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think even ortacle is needed.

[17-Jan-19 05:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just a tx with the correct data.. maybe needs more than one

[17-Jan-19 05:28 PM] TonyL#3577
On this stage it's becoming not really decentralised - so only algorithm needs to be hardcoded

[17-Jan-19 05:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
broadcast backwards with previous txid at start would be pretty easy

[17-Jan-19 05:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
signed by M of N defined in last tx

[17-Jan-19 05:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes and what kind of transaction might be correct defining in code and then M from N creating this correct transaction by consensus

[17-Jan-19 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hardcoded pubkeys --> looks for tx M of N satarting with some code... 
that tx contains the next pubkeys and timestamp when to activate those pubkeys
next tx happens from M of N defined by last tx

[17-Jan-19 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
each ERA passes its power on at some height/time

[17-Jan-19 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then you dont even need all the past keys as it loads them in advance as its syncing from the chain itself

[17-Jan-19 05:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notary nodes can send this tx to all chains

[17-Jan-19 05:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like a SUPERMAN notarisation ðŸ˜‚

[17-Jan-19 05:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Your algo seems cool

[17-Jan-19 05:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Can encode "FEK" as marker ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Jan-19 05:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
komdod already had code to search op_return by some code... from PAX

[17-Jan-19 05:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems simple enough @jl777c

[17-Jan-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
what are you trying to do?

[17-Jan-19 05:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
define pubkeys for notary nodes on chain. read my post just above

[17-Jan-19 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
As I understand goal is to move array with notary nodes pubkeys from github  to chain in a trustable decentralised way

[17-Jan-19 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
To use it as assetchain param

[17-Jan-19 05:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This way ther is only one set of notaries defined in the code.. when they change they post teh new ones in advance inchain which all nodes validate adn then use from some time.

[17-Jan-19 05:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think of course each chain woulr ned either its first set of keys as an AC param, or a hard coded array.. as they cant travel back in time on a chain thai isnt theirs
