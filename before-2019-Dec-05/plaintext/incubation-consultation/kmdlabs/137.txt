I doucmented everything, and took a screen cap video showing the process.

[29-Nov-18 12:41 PM] CrisF#3405
I want to try, but won't be able to until tomorrow.

[29-Nov-18 12:41 PM] CrisF#3405
About 19 hours from now :/

[29-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats cool. I will make sure it all works generally and check the instructions are easy enough to follow. and you an get to it when ready. I had to remove the streamer from staked komodo, so I can merge sapling stuff in.

[29-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know Alright wanmted to mess with it aswell, but just ahsnt had time. I think it might have a few small bugs that need isolating.

[29-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
From memory the last few bytes of the file were missing.... which seems very small problem considering how complicated the process is.

[29-Nov-18 12:45 PM] CrisF#3405
Great!  Looking forward to that!!

I'm assuming it was a hf, given that I haven't notarized in over 5 hrs?

@CrisF no NN for me 😃 next time maybe

[29-Nov-18 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Finally got it to build. The repo is here:
https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/tree/noStreamer

I notice only one thign that might screw with our stuff. Can someone please build this branch at some point and test if it syncs and mines/stakes PoS chains.

does your PR handle -rpcport= on the commandline?

@CrisF  Hopefully this is enough for you to test. I might be around or might not over the weekend to help you with it.

[29-Nov-18 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that particular thing took me upwards of 48H of time to solve the first time 😅  Turned out to be a very simple fix, once I understood what the problem was.

[30-Nov-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant Min sigs of 6 has fixed the problem 🚀  We need to heavily test migrates now please. Everythign should now be back to where it was on the last build, before DUCKS was launched.

[30-Nov-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to be working on testing sapling intergration to prepare us for the KMD hard fork. We need to stay equal with FSM to help test it.

[30-Nov-18 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The streamer is now in its own fork of FSM for testing, CrisF and anyone else who wants to play with that are welcome, it would be good to have that confirmed as working before the ahrd fork so it can be merged down. But that is up to james, and I need some advice on how best to implemnt the AC params, once it has been tested. The RPCs are working as is the pivate on demand mining. So it should be all sweet.

[30-Nov-18 06:16 AM] CrisF#3405

[30-Nov-18 08:08 AM] zatJUM#9924
I have some free time to test migrates. I haven't seen the command line to use to migrate from one coin to another. Could someone please post a link or the command?

[30-Nov-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a script ...

[30-Nov-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I posted it here a bunch of times, but using smks is probably better
