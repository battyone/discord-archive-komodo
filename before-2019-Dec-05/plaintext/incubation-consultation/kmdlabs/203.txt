Have an idea how to try make few hundreds migrations for the same time for which now script doing one

[08-Jan-19 07:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Gonna try to implement today

btw I think later is possible to polish all the migration stuff as lambda functions so scaling tests should cost significant less (https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/ )

Check it out guys, you can click the import and it links to the export on the other explorer 😄

[08-Jan-19 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With current things we have no possible way to link the other way... because the burn tx happens so far before the import.

[08-Jan-19 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There would need to be some other data source with this info.

[08-Jan-19 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
blockchain DB simply cannot do it.

Thrown an error when clicked on "import"

no import doesnt work

[08-Jan-19 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats just a label... the other side

[08-Jan-19 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to remove the hyperlinks on import

[08-Jan-19 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Man that's cool 😃  Great work guys!!

You're making history, and the future of this tech eh!

explorer is just about done... Thank god all these languages use C syntax, not so hard to work out. 😃

Transactions were just blasting by on `http://140.82.3.117:3002/`

[08-Jan-19 10:34 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm testing my migration_script_v2

[08-Jan-19 10:34 AM] TonyL#3577
It can do 500+ migrations in 10-15 minutes or so

[08-Jan-19 10:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Did you watch on the explorer Tony?

[08-Jan-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope

[08-Jan-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Have all needed fun in terminal 😂

I am just about to update the explorers.... I have actaulyl managed to remove all broken links 😮

[08-Jan-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nice work TonyL 😄

You're pretty serious about the bounty Tony, haha.

Thanks @blackjok3r  Doing last tests 😃  Just heard that migrations knights tournament is planning, so preparing the weapon

doesn't amtter really I guess./.. Its a competition

[08-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the hardest part will be logging it into oracles

[08-Jan-19 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
It's a super easy part

[08-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure we can push this much data to oracle safley but who knows.

[08-Jan-19 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
I have all the different transactions type in separate arrays

[08-Jan-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
And have a protocol for data broadcasting into oracle which guarantee not rekting anything

[08-Jan-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Succesfully published few megs data back and forth to/from oracles

{Reactions}
👌 

[08-Jan-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
800KB per block capacity should be more than enough for text data

[08-Jan-19 10:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Alright and Mylo both asked for the data we want to store today.  smk762 and I put up some suggestions this morning.

[08-Jan-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah got tied up hard with explorers... glad thats over

[08-Jan-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Pff we can store everything

[08-Jan-19 10:41 AM] CrisF#3405
We should decide soon.

[08-Jan-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a all txids and all hexes

[08-Jan-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hope we are not running behind.. Seems like tony is making awesome progress though

{Reactions}
👍 

[08-Jan-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
And then just decide what we want to use

[08-Jan-19 10:42 AM] CrisF#3405
If it's no trouble to collect the data, there is a big list from this morning and it's now on the pad also.

[08-Jan-19 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we should keep data to minimum.... It already exists on chain,

[08-Jan-19 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With explorers we can now track import to export, but doijg that for a million txns is impractical... thats where the loggin comes in.

[08-Jan-19 10:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Could you please have a look through what we have for this logging test and cross things off we don't need?

[08-Jan-19 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try and design JSON for data tonight

[08-Jan-19 10:43 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm just writing tools/scripts for existing tech, not possible to fall off behind 😃

👌 

[08-Jan-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are very much needed 😃

[08-Jan-19 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
2 main goals for the log data:
1. de-bugging
2. proof of migration stability (or not, haha. they have been though.)

[08-Jan-19 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Python is just superb to work with data, now I'm starting to understand why it's almost golden standard atm for Big Data and AI

{Reactions}
💯 😯 

[08-Jan-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I used python for streamer scripts to control all programs... very short amount of lines code to do very powerful thigns

[08-Jan-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@TonyL  how many nodes running that script do you think it would take to fill 4MB blocks ?

[08-Jan-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r I'm just testing it on 1 node, in general I think it's possible to make even more than 500 per script loop

[08-Jan-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never tried to do lots at once ... Because the issues we were testng were gaps in MoMoM hash, and simply doing one in each block was enough to collect the required data.

[08-Jan-19 10:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm trying to do everything gentle 😃

[08-Jan-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess the worst that can happen is you overload RPC and lock it up.

[08-Jan-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also there are ways to let Linux let you run like 50,000 instances of bash... maybe python gets around this limitation though... Bash limits the amount of processes ... I figured how to remove all the limits on scaletest... maybe those will be helpful here aswell.

[08-Jan-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
For scale test imho Python Lambda functions needed

[08-Jan-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
There is no any limitation on scaling

[08-Jan-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The scaletest we made doesnt need anythign speical, as each chain lives inside a container and just runs a marketmaker sending txns....

[08-Jan-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Serverless stuff is really cool

[08-Jan-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very simple and highly effecive...

[08-Jan-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah we used some of that

[08-Jan-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for triggering and stuff

[08-Jan-19 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
timing 8192 blockchains to start sending txns and mining at hte same time wasnt easy

[08-Jan-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, sounds massive

[08-Jan-19 10:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe I can help somehow with Python 🤔  `50,000 instances of bash` sounds scary 😃

[08-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was early on... we abandoned it totally

[08-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt work

[08-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
went with a docker container on AWS that launches in a giant cluster with 8192 CPU's 😄

[08-Jan-19 11:00 AM] TonyL#3577
8192 t.nano instances?

[08-Jan-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no they are 64 vCPu instances and each runs a kubernetes cluster

[08-Jan-19 11:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Ohh, big boys 😃

[08-Jan-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it all got extremly complicated... worked with patchkez on it for a long time.

[08-Jan-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either you cant launch that many containers ... or it just didnt happen ... not sure 🤷

[08-Jan-19 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This test is more important anyway....

[08-Jan-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Agree, just transactions test seems kinda synthetic but migrations got sense

[08-Jan-19 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah... once I started delving into these.. .and figured out how brken they were at the time... I didnt want to do 1 million tx/s... 8 months later and here we are with working mirates.

[08-Jan-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems the URL redicect ont he explorers broke 😦 checking it out, might need to wait for web to come back though.

[08-Jan-19 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh no wait... it is working 😄

[08-Jan-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Stupid explorers... the expanded view uses all diffrent code path... so you need to change each of them... I think its all done now 😃

[08-Jan-19 11:17 AM] CrisF#3405
just got a cloudflare error page on cfekx.kmdlabs.io

[08-Jan-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Can you see if you can find any bugs

[08-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I squshed them all

[08-Jan-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anything that had a link that went nowhere I managed to remove the link

[08-Jan-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the redirect was only working on not expanded view. Last update fixed that so it works with both.

[08-Jan-19 11:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Looked good to me. Following the IMP=CFEKY... link is good.

[08-Jan-19 11:30 AM] CrisF#3405
From that page, I not sure if I should be able to, I can't link back to original with ` EXPORT->CFEKX
