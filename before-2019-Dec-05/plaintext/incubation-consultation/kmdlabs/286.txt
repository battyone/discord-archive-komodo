only for assetchains... and thats what I already suggested.. No reason for another testnet for AC when we have one here

[11-Feb-19 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nearly go testnet up, havent had time to launch mining chain, if someone else here can do that that would be sweet. Just amke sure CCID is same as LABST5/RE and the chain is called `CFEK<something we havent used>` and it will work. Any params are fine on CFEK. To make it fungible it just needs same `ac_cc=` as the current 2 chains.

[11-Feb-19 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my advice is something simple with a massive block reward like 100 coins or something. 😃

[11-Feb-19 08:48 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll do that now.  Let you know when up.

@blackjok3r Should I add your `103` as a seednode?

[11-Feb-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ,  I will open ports once I manage to sync them there. Make 100% sure the repo is git pulled and rebuilt. Just toavoid any sily issues...

[11-Feb-19 09:02 AM] CrisF#3405
`staked` said it was already up to date when I git pull ed.

[11-Feb-19 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool if yusing staked repo your fine.. I avaodied pulling any upstream down that would break the build until we have stable ac_notarypay

[11-Feb-19 09:04 AM] CrisF#3405
If this is for KMD should I use non-staked?

[11-Feb-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I confirmed that reindex doesnt work with ac_notary pay and my suspected fix of removing komodostate file works, so just need to figure out where to make the daemon delete that file before a reindex starts/. 😃

💯 

[11-Feb-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no should be fine. staked komodo works with all KMD chains anyway

[11-Feb-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can safelty use it for anything 😄

[11-Feb-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in many ways its better

[11-Feb-19 09:05 AM] CrisF#3405
So used staked then?

[11-Feb-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries

[11-Feb-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe call start.sh before you manually create chains to make 100% sure its built altest... I have a change here to eras I will bush when I fix reindex, figured out how to add basically unlimited eras with almsot no code changes finally... Its pretty awesome, got it working on GIN today testing 3rd aprty coin testnet

[11-Feb-19 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
👌

[11-Feb-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fixed reindex and pushed new eras code, chains are syncing with it, so I assume its working.

There have been a few small changes pushed the last few days which to my knowledge wont affect anything.. but if anyone notices werid stuff please report it... as There could have been unintended concequences.

[11-Feb-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My next task I would like to figure out is how notaries can side load a seperate wallet 😄 
this way we can run a notary and stake on the same node, or even test. Without affecting notarisations. While working with BTC 0.17 code base today it looks perfectly possiblem, but the way they implemented it, breaks many existing RPC calls and things.. I think we can use it just to load the notarisation wallet though and leave everything else as normal... May be harder than it seems. Its not something we will need at launch.

[11-Feb-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will be fereeking awesome upgrade though... Needing an entire full node just to use a diffrent wallet its the stupidest limitation of BTC by miles.

CFEKTN, what does that even mean 😄

[11-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
CFEKTN running and mining, but anyone had a notarization yet?

[11-Feb-19 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
None here yet.

[11-Feb-19 01:33 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Maybe not enough notary nodes

[11-Feb-19 01:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, could be.  It's been a while sine I've had any notarzations.

@CrisF what is the purpose of TN

[11-Feb-19 09:09 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Well, it crashed all my python threaded scripts - so it gave me some error hunting to do

[11-Feb-19 10:11 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Hi, seems like it's a mining chain from what Blackjok3r was saying ☝.

[12-Feb-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah you guys asked for a chain with a block reward to test migrates

[12-Feb-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now you ahve it 😃

[12-Feb-19 01:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Bar_F1sh_Rel, did you find what caused the trouble with your python script?

[12-Feb-19 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume, its because there is no ntoary pay on CFETN and his script was counting that

[12-Feb-19 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is 5 borked again?

[12-Feb-19 01:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[12-Feb-19 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
umm yes I think so.,.. my node was screwed up while I was sleeping.. its not borked just has no stgakers when my node is down. Which happens a LOT

[12-Feb-19 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just staked a block... should start working again

I'm hoping to quit screwing up this Mac QT build and be back to being useful tomorrow

[12-Feb-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all good... I got a free day and not really sure what I should even be doing 😂

[12-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
Who is spamming TRE right now?

[12-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM why are you doing that?

[12-Feb-19 03:27 AM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM would appreciate if you could do that one another chain for now. Joker and I are testing something on TRE

[12-Feb-19 03:28 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r can you try to keep track of what notaries should have been paid vs what they are

[12-Feb-19 03:28 AM] Alright#0419
do you know which block it's counting from right now?

[12-Feb-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will simpley pay from the last notarized height until the next notarization

[12-Feb-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont let any notarizations happen they they cant get paid... there is nothing you can do to stop that

[12-Feb-19 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
do you know which block it's currently counting from?

[12-Feb-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
litterally nothing

[12-Feb-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure eait a minute im resyncing it locally.. the notry has no stdout

[12-Feb-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
4935 is my last notarized height here

[12-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```>>>>>>VALID NOTARIZATION ht.4935
using the current checkpoint, calculating based on previous notarized height!
blocks since last notarization: 10
``` 
This is working as expected

[12-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until this notarization is actually confirmed

[12-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
none of the other ones can be confirmed

[12-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are then this is uinvalid

[12-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they are paid at the higher height

[12-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same pay

[12-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
just wait until there are multiple notarizations in mempool

[12-Feb-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which ever one is confirmed first wil pay out

[12-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
I believe it skimped out on paying proper amount when I forced 5 into a single block by censoring

[12-Feb-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless the miner isnt slectiong them correcttly

[12-Feb-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or you changed hte miner... but I think that would just make you make invalid blocks taht dont apss validation

its working... just as its meant to... notarisations assume the only miner isnt malicious... we cant fix that... only way is to use chains that cant have just 1 miner

[12-Feb-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
4935 is now invalid, as 4955 got in

[12-Feb-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the notary pay has nopw increased

[12-Feb-19 03:35 AM] Alright#0419
did one of them get confirmed?

[12-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you mined an invalid block

[12-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and my node banned you

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
don't think that's me

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
167.... is not me

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
my nodes also banned it

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your node banned everyone else

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becaus it on a diffrent chain

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same as what happened alst time

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but this time I will keep minign the correct chain

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it will en up longer

[12-Feb-19 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
the fuck happened?

[12-Feb-19 03:37 AM] Alright#0419
I just got the entire network to ban each other?

[12-Feb-19 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you chose them out of order

[12-Feb-19 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by doing things your not meant to

[12-Feb-19 03:37 AM] Alright#0419
I didn't do anything is what I'm trying to say

[12-Feb-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
what I did made normal nodes suicide

[12-Feb-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
no idea why

[12-Feb-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand what your saying... you created an invalid block and we dissconeected from you

[12-Feb-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
that's not me.

[12-Feb-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
195 is you

[12-Feb-19 03:39 AM] Alright#0419
my attacking node and vanilla node both on the same chain with plenty of peers

[12-Feb-19 03:39 AM] Alright#0419
both of them banned 167.x.x.x

[12-Feb-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
look whatever it is your trying top prove cannot be fixed.. you cant do that to it

[12-Feb-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs to have block being mined

[12-Feb-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ytou can just ignore all ntoarizations

[12-Feb-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it WILL fork it

[12-Feb-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
I just made the network implode man............

[12-Feb-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so stop doing it :troll_cool:
