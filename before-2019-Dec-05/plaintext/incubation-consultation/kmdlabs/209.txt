177

[08-Jan-19 05:58 PM] TonyL#3577
To both sides

[08-Jan-19 05:58 PM] TonyL#3577
But import transactions  from previous batch confirming slowly - thats cool

[08-Jan-19 05:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Just have to left for some time I think

[08-Jan-19 05:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... these darn locks ... I think this is the only place left that the memoool gets locked that isnt an RPC.... I almost search replaced it ...

[08-Jan-19 05:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only needed one line

[08-Jan-19 05:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Do you still spam txs? I have 300+ in mempool already

NO!

[08-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why u cant do stuff on NN! LOL

[08-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed the loop

[08-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It expects to opnly have iguana utxo

[08-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
picks the first one it finds

[08-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than loop every one

[08-Jan-19 06:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Ohh

[08-Jan-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Will make separate node now for migrations

[08-Jan-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
AtoWallt is in debug.log... a notarisation happend and my node went compeltly insane

[08-Jan-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems not good to continue to test on NN

[08-Jan-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577
We'll find an edge cases which might be a timewasting

[08-Jan-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still didnt lock up üòÑ

My node again pooping 1 tx per few blocks

[08-Jan-19 06:24 PM] TonyL#3577
But I think it's connected to UTXOs

[08-Jan-19 06:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yesh

[08-Jan-19 06:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I know what that problem is too

[08-Jan-19 06:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Tomorrow morning I will make a fresh  node setup + add this UTXOs check to script

[08-Jan-19 06:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if there arte invalid tx in your mempool after block arrives it adds them back... we ned to enforce a mempool clear of conflicts at the end of connect tip id there isnt already one

[08-Jan-19 06:27 PM] TonyL#3577
When script pass at least once with 500 UTXOs for both imports and exports will be possible to optimise it, try multiply nodes, more migrations and so on

[08-Jan-19 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the perfect thing to do is:
1) start with 10,000 utxo on each chain
2) send to another chain each one with create raw transaction
3) on block notify when an import arrives of yours ping it back with same method
