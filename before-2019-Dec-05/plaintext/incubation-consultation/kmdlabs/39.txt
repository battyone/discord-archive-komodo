1 opreturn per tx

[15-Oct-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
see how fast it can go

[15-Oct-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
got it

[15-Oct-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
just one vout with big opreturn, after you make sure i coded it so deadbeef opreturn works

ðŸ‘Œ 

[15-Oct-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes, see how many 8kb opreturn we can have streaming from a single node

[15-Oct-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
that determines the broadcast bandwidth

[15-Oct-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
and presumably with easy mining, keeping up with it wont be a problem

[15-Oct-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be bandwidth limited .. .I will first try from 100mbit connection in Perth on my notary node, then on one of the staked notaries in asia.

[15-Oct-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldt be that  long, as long as it works.

[15-Oct-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
256kb/sec is the goal

[15-Oct-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
32 opreturns per second

[15-Oct-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
less than the 50 to 100 we have seen

[15-Oct-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[15-Oct-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
took a bit longer than it should have but that part is working... looks like you did the code the exact same way as I was going to, just copy from withdraw.

[15-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to generate 8kb string and try that now.

[15-Oct-18 10:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, setting up trollbox.  Getting this```Error reading configuration file: Missing komodo.conf```Did `./start.sh` previously.
komodo.conf is in `.komodo`

[15-Oct-18 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
git pull again

[15-Oct-18 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
I fixed something in the chatreceive script

[15-Oct-18 10:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks.

[15-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
doubt anyone is on right now @CrisF

[15-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
I have that other oracle open if you want to go on there

[15-Oct-18 11:01 AM] Alright#0419
sitting here testing stuff for a script I'm making

[15-Oct-18 11:01 AM] Alright#0419
new oracle on STAKEDB1 that is

[15-Oct-18 11:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Sure, happy to give that a go.

[15-Oct-18 11:08 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm not sure where to find it though.

[15-Oct-18 11:08 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright

[15-Oct-18 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oracleslist` will give you a list of oracles

[15-Oct-18 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
the one I'm testing right now is `c5ae01f5fad12bfc8bb24d6f8b1f3a02e72c94e153d544f16816e741f8d1f446`

[15-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Alright#0419
just need to do `komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclesregister c5ae01f5fad12bfc8bb24d6f8b1f3a02e72c94e153d544f16816e741f8d1f446 1000000`

[15-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
then `komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 sendrawtransactions $(komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclessubsribe c5ae01f5fad12bfc8bb24d6f8b1f3a02e72c94e153d544f16816e741f8d1f446 <pubkey> 1 | jq -r .hex)` a couple times

[15-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
then start chatsend and chatreceive with `STAKEDB1 c5ae01f5fad12bfc8bb24d6f8b1f3a02e72c94e153d544f16816e741f8d1f446`

[15-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
so `./chatreceive STAKEDB1 c5ae01f5fad12bfc8bb24d6f8b1f3a02e72c94e153d544f16816e741f8d1f446` and `./chatsend STAKEDB1 c5ae01f5fad12bfc8bb24d6f8b1f3a02e72c94e153d544f16816e741f8d1f446`

[15-Oct-18 11:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok ðŸ˜ƒ

[15-Oct-18 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
Sorry @CrisF need to get off for a couple hours, so you'll be lonely if you do that ðŸ˜›

is pinned STAKEDTROLL still current, and what is STAKEDB1?

[15-Oct-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[15-Oct-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they get removed pretty fast if things dont work

[15-Oct-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
B1 has always been there I think, and W1 ... they are quite long now

[15-Oct-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In other news I got TxBlaster working with OP_RETURN ... still a hardcoded hex string, and still trying to workout what lengths = what KB's

[15-Oct-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be ready to blast STKDTROLL soon .

[15-Oct-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181

you dont need komodo installed

[15-Oct-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it does everything for you

ok cool that's the workflow cool.  nice

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
takes some time the first go though

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... if poeple had to compole diff branches ... and enter all diffrent start prams

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then nonoe would help us test

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you can just start it and then do fun stuff ..

[15-Oct-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we will get more participation

[15-Oct-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Some of the scripts I wrote for this project are just stupid ... I dont even know how they work anymore

[15-Oct-18 11:59 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah you gotta get into the zone

[15-Oct-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the TROLL stuff in that repo is outdated btw ... need to remove the instructions

[15-Oct-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but havent had time, or just forgot about it.

[15-Oct-18 12:00 PM] Mylo#8306
is it just the README that is outdated, all the rest is quite stable/re-usable for the channel?  cos i'll go ahead and dockerize it today then

[15-Oct-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ¤”

[15-Oct-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure on that man.. I would like to test it a bit more first, or have others test it

[15-Oct-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the start script, builds everything

[15-Oct-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not 100% sure you cna even do that inside a container

[15-Oct-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you can .. but thats not how its supposed to work.

[15-Oct-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I assumed mostly people would use VPS or a local VM to test these things

[15-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Mylo#8306
ok - i'll leave it for today, i've got other stuff to work on, but do wanna play with the oracle stuff in this chan today/tomorrow

[15-Oct-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wait for Alright .. hes taken the lead on the oracles chat, and got all of  it working so far

[15-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Mylo#8306
ok - oracle chat replaces KV chat?

[15-Oct-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[15-Oct-18 12:03 PM] Mylo#8306
swift!

[15-Oct-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
KV chat was too slow for @Alright

[15-Oct-18 12:03 PM] Mylo#8306
not twangy enough

[15-Oct-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Haha KV chain is very fast but oracles works out of mempool.... I still think there needs to be some hybrid of the chains, but to make it backwards compatible with komodod we need a customisable faucet contract.

[15-Oct-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand the need for faucet2

[15-Oct-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean it would be nice, but why is it so critical?

[15-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Mylo#8306
critical, nice to have is ok.  or critical, can be done in the next month, or critical would be nice to have for documentation on how to blend two CC techniques and make a third more flexible one?

[15-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Mylo#8306
a, b or c.  or d.  don't bother.

[15-Oct-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand the requirement of faucet2 for mempool things

[15-Oct-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
its not like faucet2 creates the mempool

[15-Oct-18 12:23 PM] Mylo#8306
i've got it far down on my list for something to do for a documentation exercise if it hasn't been completed by someone else.

[15-Oct-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so chat is free ... I dont know, maybe its not required...

[15-Oct-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just have all address have balance all the time :trollface:

[15-Oct-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh I still dont understantd how it works, what Alright made... it like some how pays yourself to send chat messages or something... so using the chat cost some locked coins or something.

[15-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
just have enough coins to chat. why do we need to construct a new faucet2?

[15-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
dont overengineer

[15-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
less is more

[15-Oct-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems to have broken it ðŸ˜‚

[15-Oct-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  I sent 40MB of opreturns to the mempool, 3 blocks were mined with a few TX 2-4 and then I think my node was banned, its mempool is full, but the notaries mempool is empty.

[15-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe pace things slower?

[15-Oct-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To get the mamimum posible OP_RETURN size, I just started with a hex string of 16384 and then decreased it unitl it passed the length check in marketmaker.

[15-Oct-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was able to send single tx just fine... but flood was no good

[15-Oct-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ¤”

[15-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sleep in marketmaker maybe

[15-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
usleep(50000) ?

[15-Oct-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
Is it possible the OP_RETURN is causing the change address to be invalid ?Alright mentioned something about this.

[15-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i forget how txblaster did the change address

[15-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the vout # is not the right one

[15-Oct-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will play with it and see what happens, all tests at first were with 1 loop, will try just 3 and test it.

[15-Oct-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The mempool is the limit it seems, if yu blast on a node thats mining it works ... maybe its a problem with this particular chain, it fails the checkverify on start, and I have to do some silly tricks to get it to load ... ðŸ¤” 
maybe we need a new chain wihtout htat issue.

[15-Oct-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
for now just blast on the node that is mining

[15-Oct-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it kind of makes sense for the broadcaster to be mining

[15-Oct-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was just using a badly connected node

[15-Oct-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doing it from notary with all 4 cores mining and its flying ..
