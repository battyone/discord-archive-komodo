[02-Nov-18 12:12 PM] Alright#0419

[02-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats the old staking script ... it relies on other scripts to work

[02-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ys

[02-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Alright#0419
so LF didn't get funding?

LF funded

[02-Nov-18 12:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thanks

[02-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
could really use someone else staking all the chains immediately

[02-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
can't do it from your notary, need a separate node

[02-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @blackjok3r your notaries are running?

[02-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Alright#0419

[02-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
Hmmm shouldn't I have set min sigs somewhere or was that removed?

[02-Nov-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
min sigs is in staked.json

[02-Nov-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181

what's the trick for only importing the ass end of the wallet for a specific key

[02-Nov-18 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
watching my komodo debug.log, just thousands of AddToWallets flying by

[02-Nov-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
z_importkey I think has a height parameter

[02-Nov-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait for it to finish then rin ./walletreset.sh`

[02-Nov-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or something similar

[02-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its all in the repo built in

[02-Nov-18 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it does the rescan of all the wallet from the height

[02-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
usin z_importkey

[02-Nov-18 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
z_importkey "zkey" ( rescan startHeight )

[02-Nov-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
ty

[02-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it rescans the whole wallet the first time you load it ... This is waht stareted me off on the dwy mitigation quest today

[02-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to see if I could just not add the xts to wallet

[02-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you have to üò¶

[02-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the tx and vout are all the same structure int he wallet... so yo cant just remove a vout after its spent

[02-Nov-18 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant if you have a pubkey in the current source code https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/blob/master/src/notaries_staked.cpp please delete StakedNotary(backup config.ini!), clone it and follow the readme again

Sorry I missed the start.  Back from a major shill-fest and ready to roll.
What should I be doing?

[02-Nov-18 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
you're addresses are funded on each chain

[02-Nov-18 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
if you have a key right now, and you don't notarize before mainnet, we're removing you

[02-Nov-18 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
Also, we'll be changing pubkeys within the next couple of days

[02-Nov-18 12:26 PM] Alright#0419
I'm going to start an oracle on CFEK for gathering pubkeys of people interested in running a notary

[02-Nov-18 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r  you are messing with dangerous things by changing wallet behavior, but if it isnt for general use i wont worry

[02-Nov-18 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not for any generalt use .. im on my own branch

[02-Nov-18 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
having a pubkey in source that is not notarizing can be very detrimental to us

[02-Nov-18 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
so if you aren't interested in maintaining the node, please don't submit a pubkey

[02-Nov-18 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
each 5(?) pubkeys in source code raises the min sigs required for a notarization

[02-Nov-18 12:29 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright To confirm, I SHOULD use the pubkey in ```https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/blob/master/src/notaries_staked.cpp```?

[02-Nov-18 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
for now, yes

[02-Nov-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm seems wallet reset migh be deaded atm ...

[02-Nov-18 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
I'll set up an oracle to submit new pubkeys on CFEK

[02-Nov-18 12:29 PM] CrisF#3405
thx

[02-Nov-18 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Alright I managed to both pool and notary up without deleting StakedNotary. Do I have to?

[02-Nov-18 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
nope

[02-Nov-18 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
