it ahs 0BR whoi whoudl do that

[16-Jan-19 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont htnk anything... I have a vega64 that does 1600GH/s here but its not set up atm for mining since the algo switch

[16-Jan-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
who would ddos CHIPS pools when the BR is less than a penny?

[16-Jan-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
answer is *someone*

[16-Jan-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
like we can't assume someone won't do it because it's not worth it

[16-Jan-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
being a dead algo I doubt there are even FPGA out nthere for it anymore either... theyt would ahve switched to somethign else

[16-Jan-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for chains that just need CPU minnig this seems a decent chopice... make PoS% maybe not 50 ... maybe even more not sure

[16-Jan-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe less...

[16-Jan-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you dont need as many coins

[16-Jan-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is using 100k coins

[16-Jan-19 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gives buying power to LABS too... you would need to buy liiek 100,000 of them to launch a chain with PoS

[16-Jan-19 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or it would just stop üòÇ

[16-Jan-19 02:13 AM] Alright#0419
100000 is a lot of LABS to run a chain

[16-Jan-19 02:13 AM] Alright#0419
that's like a full week of BRs

[16-Jan-19 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
I guess you aren't actually spending it, so it's not the literal cost

[16-Jan-19 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
more of a deposit?

[16-Jan-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I will try a chain with lower and maybe more PoW  %

[16-Jan-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this version is stable enough for us to9 amke a chain between us if you like?

[16-Jan-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It might not be perfect but its a good start

[16-Jan-19 02:17 AM] Alright#0419
sure

[16-Jan-19 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```        if ( ASSETCHAINS_ALGO == ASSETCHAINS_VERUSHASH )
        {
            if ( nHeight < 100 )
                coinage *= coinage/4;
            else
                coinage *= coinage/6;
        }```

[16-Jan-19 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this seems to be the trick...

[16-Jan-19 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to try and drive the diff to the moon in the first 100 blocks.

[16-Jan-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181

```        if ( bnTarget > easydiff )
            bnTarget = easydiff;```
This seems to be the cause of 1s blocks. @jl777c  Why is the diff set to 1 as soon as the PoS percentage is less than goal ?

[16-Jan-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should pull it down gradually right? not just switch directly to 1 ?

[16-Jan-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
that is dealing with overflow

[16-Jan-19 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is the line above that

[16-Jan-19 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont want a target that is easier than easydiff

[16-Jan-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
easydiff is easy enough

[16-Jan-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ah ok... makes sense... Just struggling to work out why as soona s it goes 1% lower on PoS side it jsut does 1-3s blocks...

[16-Jan-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
this is very tricky code

[16-Jan-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and changing anything will hardfork all the ac_staked chains

[16-Jan-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the diff wall on PoW is fine going in one direction but in the otehrmdirection its overcompensating .. lowering diff far too much

[16-Jan-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know that... we are using a diffrent branch

[16-Jan-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
ASIC can come online and go offline

[16-Jan-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and verushash... not too ahrd to contain these changes to verushash only

[16-Jan-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, make sure all is guarded for verushash only

[16-Jan-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
then it can be used in main codebase

[16-Jan-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am.. we started a 100% staked chain... seems to work the same as equihash so no reason to use verushash for that

[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
push the PoW with many cores, then stop it

[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
introiducing any PoW % makes for interesting blocktimes...

[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that was the reason for the big adjustments

[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the average isnt bad...

[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its all over the place...

[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it is only the average that can be controlled

[16-Jan-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be all over the place

[16-Jan-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess with a notaisatin freq of 5

[16-Jan-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have it about as close as it can be

[16-Jan-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the feedback mechansim operates on the average time

[16-Jan-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah we need to leave this chain running a few days and see how it turns out at this point I guess

[16-Jan-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is easy to forget that in the overall scheme of things if there is a half a day of faster or slower than normal blocks, really it isnt a big deal as long as overall it is achieving one minute blocks

[16-Jan-19 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```block 295 : 500
block 296 : -58
block 297 : 11
block 298 : 2
block 299 : 60
block 300 : 4
block 301 : 10
block 302 : 56
block 303 : 6
block 304 : 2
block 305 : 6
block 306 : 15
block 307 : 64
block 308 : 42

block 314 : 8
block 315 : 3
block 316 : 130
block 317 : 396
block 318 : -58
```
This is only 10% PoS

[16-Jan-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
block time in seconds

[16-Jan-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not too bad on average.

[16-Jan-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I guess at least it can never stop for longer than 500s

[16-Jan-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even with wild hash rate swings

[16-Jan-19 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks like the way to go for 0BR chains is simply to use 100% PoS....

[16-Jan-19 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That chain is perfect

[16-Jan-19 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might have just got the staker to not peg a CPU core üòÉ

[16-Jan-19 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also that wallet fix, I made is working perfectly. CFEKPOS51 had 4 corrupted txns... clean out and re added no problem without rescan when i restarted it just before.

Found the problem with VerusHash mining 1s blocks... min diff for equihash and verushash are diffrent... Just trying to work out how to get verus min diff, then I can fix it.

[16-Jan-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, glad you found it

[16-Jan-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`504303375` for Verus vs `537857807`
Quite diffrent... I think making `KOMODO_MINDIFF_NBITS` a global instead of a macro and assigning it the mindiff for each Hashing Algo on daemon init will be the easiet way to solve this? @jl777c

[16-Jan-19 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait that cant work... Will figure something out

[16-Jan-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
probably an if ( VERUSHASH) easydiff = VERUS_MINDIFF_NBITS

[16-Jan-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
or make mindiff nbits a function?

[16-Jan-19 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I am trying, is how it has an array for each algo, put the min diff in there. In a new array. Then set the PoS mindiff to a global. On init when the algo is chosen it sets this gobal to that algos min diff. 
The global defaults to equihash.. 
Ideally we only want to set the min diff in the staking loops, which is only used 3 times in `komodo_bitcoind.h` If we also set this int he miner, then we get the issue where it pins a CPU to calculate min PoW... by setting this lower in the ming loop its finds the blockmuch faster.

[16-Jan-19 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And uses less CPU... Most new people always keep asking why the PoS here uses a whole core.. I worked it out today and have somewhat fixed it. Fix wasn't possible before with the staking loop in a lock cs_main.

[16-Jan-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am still seeing 100% cpu, I think thats only because Im the only staker though, so the RAM staker is resetting every block.

[16-Jan-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
these are good improvements

[16-Jan-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
we can now start thinking of adding all the various hash algos, but really i dont see much value . in a coin that just has a different algo for the sake of having a different algo, unless it is fpga and/or GPU resistant

[16-Jan-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree... But it is something that will get more people to use an AC...

[16-Jan-19 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the option is there... they cna use it... Better still if they can add PoS % to any exising PoW algo üòâ

[16-Jan-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it theoretically possible to implement Ethash algo for mining?

[16-Jan-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say yes. Not sure how hard it would be

[16-Jan-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as how it chooses the algo and such, it would be easy... I think the verus miner may be anle to handle more than one not too sure.. It seems half way implemented to add as many as we like.

[16-Jan-19 09:14 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash since Ethereum going to PoS - maybe possible to attract some miners if make Ethash mineable algo project with value

It seems like not much practical sense but if also implement Solidity CCs support - maybe will be attractive for current Ethereum community who don't like POS switching

[16-Jan-19 09:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Since ETC is not very alive there is not many choices. Run UTXO based chain which cover functionality of Ethereum is more secure and can provide even more - sounds very impressive. Hope one day there will be a hero whom make a Solidity -> CCs bridge as well as bridge with EOS stuff ü§û

[16-Jan-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
One command - you run BTC like chain, other - you support an Ethereum apps, third one - you support an EOS apps  and so on üöÄ

[16-Jan-19 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
And we have a dPOW + migrations possibilities

[16-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Setting the min diff on daemon init worked first go.. Now to test if it fixed verus hash... another chain üòÖ

[16-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im guess a probblem with his script doing so many at once, because in all the testing we have ever done its only ever failed once it got past here:
```Import transactions completed on KMD chain: 10690```

[16-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and that issue is 100% fixed now it seems

[16-Jan-19 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If he has the export + payouts, he should be able to complete the "lost/failed" transactions.... if he cant we are back bug hunting again.

[16-Jan-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not missing

[16-Jan-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
It's just not passed yet

[16-Jan-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
It have separate queues and threads for each step

[16-Jan-19 11:12 AM] TonyL#3577
But anyway seems like a no needed complicity and overkill this threading. Just was interesting to try. Fastest and most reliable option which I've found so far is to use script_v2 with batch of 5000 migrations in while True mode (finish one 5000 migrations - then start other 5000 and so on)
