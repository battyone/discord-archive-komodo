[02-Nov-18 01:51 PM] Alright#0419
not sure we have a test pubkey we can give you @gt, if you wait a day or two, we'll be changing pubkeys in source code as a test

[02-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
you'll need to sync CFEK and leave your pubkey in an oracle

[02-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
that I have yet to make

[02-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r might be willing to give up one of his test pubkeys

[02-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
we're removing them when we change them anyway

[02-Nov-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can give an old test key

[02-Nov-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But beware it will take hours to start with an old key

[02-Nov-18 02:49 PM] gcharang#6833
Is there any other way to check notarization numbers?

[02-Nov-18 02:49 PM] CrisF#3405
There is a stats script.

[02-Nov-18 02:49 PM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if it's working atm.

Mine is working,too

[02-Nov-18 02:51 PM] CrisF#3405
That's also the only chain I'm not mining/staking.

[02-Nov-18 02:52 PM] gcharang#6833

[02-Nov-18 02:52 PM] CrisF#3405

[02-Nov-18 02:52 PM] CrisF#3405
MyCFEK seems to have gone down again.

[02-Nov-18 02:54 PM] CMaurice#1685
aye here too

[02-Nov-18 02:55 PM] CrisF#3405
It's the 2nd or 3rd time.
Seems to be having trouble due to lack of staking and too much mining.

[02-Nov-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Nov-18 02:57 PM] CrisF#3405

why is there a problem with one of them?

[02-Nov-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im not sure, but Get transaction was crashing stuff... did we merge in that fdix?

[02-Nov-18 03:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Doesn't seem MLT is notarizing.  Have you had any?

[02-Nov-18 03:02 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright

[02-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r probably missed it on master

[02-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Alright#0419
the other two were fine

[02-Nov-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool... looking into how I cna fix that

[02-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
I haven't had any notarizations on MLT @CrisF

[02-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
looking into why now

[02-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
thanks for telling me that

[02-Nov-18 03:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF @CMaurice I think you guys need to do ./stop.sh and then ./start.sh as ./stats crashes atleast 2 of the daemons

[02-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
üëÜ

[02-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
might want to wait a minute, hopefully joker can merge in the fix relatively soon

[02-Nov-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes Get Transaction is crashig Master

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, I have been.

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] CMaurice#1685
yep, did that, they're up again and have resisted running ./stats again üòâ

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This will be tricky

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I really dont want to merge the mempool fix into all chains

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
so don't

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But we nede this crash fix

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
take out dpowconfs?

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
that's what introduced the bug I believe

[02-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
for now that is

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the bug was fixed

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just have to find the commit it was fixed at

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and go a checkout -b

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
then just wait until these branches can be merged to master

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then merge that branch into master Ithink

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] CMaurice#1685
can you cpu mine as a nn?

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
nope

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can, but its not recomended to

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] CMaurice#1685
kk, thanks

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
Oh I thought you meant easy mining

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
similar to KMD notaries

[02-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
answer to that is no

[02-Nov-18 03:11 PM] CMaurice#1685
no, I meant mine as a node

[02-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Alright#0419
try it ü§∑

[02-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Alright#0419
is a good test

[02-Nov-18 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
