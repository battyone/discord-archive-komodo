`CFEKSTATS`

[09-Mar-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
any time you find yourself doing some convoluted combo of rpcs commands to get some specific data, ask yourself "Could joker make an rpc for this?"

it gets data hourly, so block time can be slower than bitcoin 😃

[09-Mar-19 02:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, there's a `getblocksubsidy` RPC which was nice

[09-Mar-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
that only includes literal miner subsidy

[09-Mar-19 02:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Would a `CFEKSTATS` and a `LABSTATS` be any good?

[09-Mar-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
not anything special like ac_script or ac_pubkey stuff

Hi, are there any explorers up for `LABS` or `CFEK` chains?

[09-Mar-19 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is there a good explanation of notarypay param somewhere?

[09-Mar-19 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is it per block or per ntx? who gets it? etc.

If the chain uses getnotarysendmany() that would be useable to mask out payment?

migration graph is pretty close - http://oracle.earth/migrate_graph/
left values are before filtering, so ignore that. a coupe of blips to the right I'm not sure of, unless its due to tx in progress 🤷

[09-Mar-19 10:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might even out more once extending data rate to hourly. its at 15 min at the moment to populate the graph faster for testing

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  notary pay is part of the coinbase transaction. If you ignore tx[0] of each block, it will be ignored.

[09-Mar-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still dont see any confirmation all notaries are updated, like 3 people reported.

[09-Mar-19 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[09-Mar-19 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I need to change the port back to 9997 ? And split the network again.

[09-Mar-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wasting days of valuable testing time here... Wihtout everyone using KMD height -5, there will be competeing notarizations and MoMoM hash will have all kinds of gaps.

[09-Mar-19 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
I updated yesterday.  Don't remember if I reported, sorry if not!

[09-Mar-19 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
(re-started again today, too. ☝ )

[09-Mar-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah a few of you reported... I just figured taking a few days off might be enough to know that everyone has updated, but it seem they are eiter not around, or forgot to report they updated 😦

[09-Mar-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I will just try some migrates tomorrow and hope for the best, and if they are not working change hte iguana port and ping everyone tomorrow around this time, or a few hours earlier. Maybe even DM each notary.

Been fixing daughters computer all day. iBook G3... hot glued a micro SSD into it... lol its the fastest old computer I've ever used, overclocked 700Mhz PowerPC CPU and 640MB of RAM, 120GB SSD, everything loads instantly, but it struggles to browse the internet... pretty much useful for word processing and Older games like Age of Empries 2 and sim city.

I'm not looking at block transactions, too much filtering there... I think the algo I'm using is working. Basically 
`change in coin supply - (change in block height*blocksubsidy) - (change in notarisationcount*notarypay)`

this PR ... I merged it to a new branch. Checking now to see what is changed, doesnt appear to be backwards compatible.. so Will requuire new chains, and may also change KMD, so might kill the entire cluster apart from ORKL...

[09-Mar-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I really want to test migrate with -5 kmd height before merging this stuff in, incease it causes any problems.

there is nothing we can do about it 😦

[09-Mar-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its sapling merge related and seems to be part fo teh fix for the sprout inflations bug. It littrerallyt loops the entire block index and adds up all the coins on every start I think.

[09-Mar-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont understand why it cant use a saved value in the database 😕

[09-Mar-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt be doing a coinsupply call on each start

[09-Mar-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not.

this loop takes forever, especially on a slow CPU core. Maxes one core for 15mins on my notary node to load KMD. 😮

[09-Mar-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r
as far as I can tell, RAM usage of daemons seems to be growing ~10-20MB per day (based on KMD, presumably at a rate equal with chain growth)
iguana, however, is growing at ~ 10-11MB per *hour*

[09-Mar-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana grows until it stops... we can  maybe make it grow until a smaller number... but until its stops getting bigger we cant know of the fix works or not. As it doesnt free all the memory... there is a pretty extensive history of dpow_blocks saved.

[09-Mar-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My main net node, seems to be using less ram, but its very ahrd to know until its been running a week or longer withotu restart

[09-Mar-19 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there is a pretty extensive history of dpow_blocks saved.`
Is there a functional reason for that to remain resident in RAM?

[09-Mar-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea

[09-Mar-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
once the notarization thread is done, it can be freed

[09-Mar-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
problem is that the main process seems to need to do the freeing as it was the one that allocated it

[09-Mar-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
timing error will create crashes

[09-Mar-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive made it set a finished flag on every single return in dpowstatemachine_start, then changed the free to use this flag isntead of state to free the memory

[09-Mar-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
appears it still grows at the same rate ... but its only been running just over a day

[09-Mar-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
after 2 days, mine's been pretty consistent with the 10-11 (there was 1 that grew 13, but averaged to 10 with the hr on either side)

Think I was up-to-date. Restarted just to make sure.

[10-Mar-19 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thnaks everyone. I still have a bunhc of failed migrates over night. BUt I know exactly what the problem is. We need to standardise the call to calcproofroot... Which is what I said the other day when I was rambling all thos paragraphs saying I couldnt fix it 😂

[10-Mar-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to extend the range back even further to make sure 100% its catching everything (may or may not be needed, but shouldnt hurt) 
Then I need to do some special math to make sure that iguana and `migrate_completeimporttransaction` are using some standard heights.
 I think that for iguana it should be asking for KMD height -5, and then the daemon should take that height (in MoMoMdata RPC) , and keep counting down until it gets to the closest height that is an even 5. ( height % 5 == 0 )
Then when we do the `migrate_completeimporttransaction`  it shuold find the KMD height its looking for currently, then do much the same thing, but I think forwards.  It needs to scan forwards tothe closest KMD block that   ( height % 5 == 0 ) 
Once again, the problem is stemming from the timing of the MoMoM calculation. It assumes perfect conditions, and with PoS chains that does not happen. ight be possible to not need this modulo 5 thing, going to try a bruteforce, of completing import transaction with multiple heights, like scan around the height it comes up with, and use heights around that then try sending the tx on the target with all the generated transactions. 

The assumption libscottr made that there wasn;t more than 1 assetchain notarization on KMD in each block, is the entirte reason this has not worked from the beginning. He said making iguana wait for a confirm before sending the next one, would be all it needs, but he forgot about reorgs, and mempool propagation times. So that simply doesnt work. We need another solution, which I am very close to.

It worked

[10-Mar-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its really not easy to code this fix in though.... I just hardcoded the block height into my KMD daemon to test this lol.

[10-Mar-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The answer is a to bruteforce a range of KMD heights and broadcast all of them until one works.

[10-Mar-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I went +2 blocks and it worked rightaway

[10-Mar-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first go. 😃

[10-Mar-19 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly will be the way to go, rather than try and standardise height as that will get complicated...

[10-Mar-19 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks liek MoMoM hash having a gap is 100% fixed,m its jsut that the two times the MoMoM is calcualted are given diffrent inputs, so the trick is to feed it a bunch of inputs until you get he one that iguana gave it 😆

[10-Mar-19 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty much working on every failed import lol... It wasnt hard to fix either. Will need to auotmate this in migrate script. But as we have a new RPC call for that,... I guess its time to make new chains and merge in dimxys new PR and start testing it. 🚀

CFEKORKL has no chains in its cluster and therfor never had an import yes @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  ?

[10-Mar-19 05:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
true

[10-Mar-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we can keep that chain and add a chain to its cluster.

[10-Mar-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the new import code is hardfork

[10-Mar-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if no import happened then its fine

[10-Mar-19 05:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had some issues with the migrate checking, notary pay calc. tried to tweak, but then LABSTH0 didnt want to give coinsupply anymore

[10-Mar-19 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well for now just keep what you have... and wait becasuse we need to start again to test this backup notary txid mechanisim in case of failed import

[10-Mar-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and there wil also be the ability to transfer non-fungible tokesn from one chain to another 🚀

[10-Mar-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the migrate script becomes a shit load simpler... but will need my bruteforce sledgehammer fix added to it also incase of fail, rather than log and exit... just keep adding 1 block offset until a diffrent importtx is returned, then send that... seems to work every time 😄

[10-Mar-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why IU built a very very fast computer here....
