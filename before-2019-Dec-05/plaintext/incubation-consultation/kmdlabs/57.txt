so nodes on old version will just stop notarising

[31-Oct-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```    // Check proof confirms existance of burnTx
    {
        uint256 target = proof.second.Exec(burnTx.GetHash());
        if (!CheckManyMoMoMs(proof.first, target))
            return Invalid("momom-check-fail");
    }```

[31-Oct-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to wait for `CheckManyMoMoMs` function to be written before we bother doing anything. sorry for false alarm, It seems my fix wouldnt exactly work, it may do, but there can still be a problem with this part of the code that needs fixing.

Sounds like an test worth running, nice detective work to spot it.

YEs I think when Alright shows up we should run a test, ther eis no reason to keep smashing through migrates in PIXY/DUST when we know they are fine...

[31-Oct-18 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However as this code change is on the KMD side, we need all new chains to make sure it works properly

[31-Oct-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it works better than before great ... if not we still need the check so that it checks 3 momom's on the import side, if the one it assumes to be the right one is not, it should scan back one further, if that is wrong as well, it should scan forward one and check that aswell.

[31-Oct-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only then should it return a fail

not as many to play with as I'd like, but that's an array of some usable ones.

Haven't checked mine in a while, did notice while testing yesterday that some chains didn't seem to be being mined

[31-Oct-18 11:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also our 4 notaries are very low on money and could be off

[31-Oct-18 11:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wouldn't worry too much need to kill it and start some new chains as soon as alright is around

@blackjok3r I'll be around most of today. give me a shout if there's anything I can do.

[01-Nov-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Without alright I can't do much, I'll be around too, going to start on the block reward stuff in the mean time

[01-Nov-18 12:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok.  I'll be checking off stuff on my to do list.

He has no idea

[01-Nov-18 01:31 AM] CrisF#3405
There are a few lessons he can learn from this then.

[01-Nov-18 01:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Like not using nanes that can connect the dots

[01-Nov-18 01:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

3 days in 8th grade is better than 3 years in 12th

[01-Nov-18 01:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah

[01-Nov-18 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what do we need to do

[01-Nov-18 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
do we want to start a new notary network entirely?

[01-Nov-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no we just need to stop all current chains and replace them with new ones

[01-Nov-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can do like just 4 for now

[01-Nov-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
save too much work

[01-Nov-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It might be best to change he iguana port just incase ...

[01-Nov-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I dont think its 100% needed

[01-Nov-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only reason I want new ones, if to make 100% sure any problems found are not from some other reason, clean chains on new code is needed to test the change properly

[01-Nov-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is stil a problem, we need to wait for libscott to finish his new function.

[01-Nov-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you wanted to keep a few of the old chains, you can, just put the new ones in a new cluster ID.

[01-Nov-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and migrate will probably be broken on the old ones, everythig else should still work though.

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
changing iguana port *is* making new notary network, no?

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well yes, you dont NEED to do that ..

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
how about we simulate actual STAKED as close as possible

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
1 main chain with 51/49

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sound sgood

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
as many chains as we want with 0 BR

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
ok, I'll start up 3?

[01-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
4?

[01-Nov-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I like that, make a large premine, and I will try to migrate coins ot the other chains in lots of 1 coins over a few days

[01-Nov-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
freq = 5

[01-Nov-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on all chains except 1 chain, which will need freq = 10

[01-Nov-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is therea any need at all to keep old chains ?

[01-Nov-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or can we just kill them ?

[01-Nov-18 05:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Will the cluster being made now become a testnet when things go live?

[01-Nov-18 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I guess so, seems we should have some kind of testnet, but with our small VPS's having huge amounts of chains on testnet is not really possible.

[01-Nov-18 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tesntnet should stay small

[01-Nov-18 05:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Does that mean 4 nodes, or smaller?

[01-Nov-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
yea, we were planning to keep a network alive as testnet

[01-Nov-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
maybe really tiny amount of min sigs

[01-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
no incentivize to run a testnet notary, so it'll likely just be joker and I

[01-Nov-18 05:24 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll add a node for a testnet.

[01-Nov-18 05:24 AM] CrisF#3405
If that helps.

[01-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
it does

[01-Nov-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
3 is about the lowest you can go ... it would need its own branch and stuff... id diff pubkeys ....

[01-Nov-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
add extra complexity, id rather worry about later

[01-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
so we do 3 then?

[01-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Alright#0419
do you have enough VPSs to handle multiple notaries

[01-Nov-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the pubkeys list istn too long ... surrently it doesnt let you set minsigs in komodod, its deterministic of the amount of pubkeys

[01-Nov-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess we can change that though

[01-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Alright#0419
ok so what's the plan here

[01-Nov-18 05:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Me?  I have 6 now.  but want to cut that down.

[01-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Alright#0419
I'll make 3? 4? chains

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
fund the current notaries

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ye r for now .. make a main chain that will be a copy of staked

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and 2 chains with freq= 5 and 1 of freq = 10

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
Are we going to just overwrite the current assetchain.json and let this network die?

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats best yes

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
or use separate branch?

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use the same

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and kill this one...

[01-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
üëå

[01-Nov-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we cna use smae notaries and just run stop and start

[01-Nov-18 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant feel free to kill your notary if you're still running one, we're setting up a new network right now. This is the ClusterFuck network(STAKED testnet)

if any troubles we can debug it now ... i was able to syc chains iwht that branch that were not steamers so it seems I didnt amke any mistakes with the comand line options

[01-Nov-18 05:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Will there be any PoS chains?
