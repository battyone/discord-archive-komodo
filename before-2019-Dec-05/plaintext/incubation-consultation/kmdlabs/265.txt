💯 

[02-Feb-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... depening on what they get paid per ntoarisation... it would be pennies

[02-Feb-19 07:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
dammit wrong keyboard.... still issues on some of my nodes

[02-Feb-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each invalid they create woul;d be the pay *2

[02-Feb-19 07:49 AM] Alright#0419
notaries could notarize a false chain or bad hashes anyway

[02-Feb-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is ONLY a problem if 100% of notaries on 1 chain modify iguana

[02-Feb-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a huge fuck around and not easy to do

[02-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
it would be immediately noticeable and they wouldn't be able to get more coins than if they notarized properly

[02-Feb-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they would

[02-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
how?

[02-Feb-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
last hntoarised height returns a valid ntoarisation

[02-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Alright#0419
Ah the same 6 getting all notarizations?

[02-Feb-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you make notarisations woith invalid OP_RETURN data...

[02-Feb-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will pay you for making them...

[02-Feb-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the last notarised height will never increase

[02-Feb-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the amount they get would exponentally rise

[02-Feb-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT it requires minsigs to modigy iguana to do it... and we know who they are

[02-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand

[02-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```notarizedht = komodo_notarized_height(&prevMoMheight,&notarizedhash,&txid);
    // dont think this can happen, just sanity check.
    if ( height == notarizedht )
        return(0);
    // how many block since last notarisation.
    int32_t n = height - notarizedht;
    if ( n == 5 )
    {
        // exactly 5 blocks since last notarisation 
        return(ASSETCHAINS_NOTARY_PAY);
    }
    if ( n > 5 )
    {
        // more than 5 block since last notarisation, increase pay
        return(ASSETCHAINS_NOTARY_PAY);
    }
    if ( n < 5 )
    {
        // less than 5 block since last notarisation, decrease pay
        return(ASSETCHAINS_NOTARY_PAY);
    }```

[02-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
\

[02-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is what I have so far

[02-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
height needs to be extracted fromt eh OP_RETURN itself

[02-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise tis innacurate

[02-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
the only thing they can do is get 6 to collude and get all notarizations for the chain by broadcasting invalid notarizations before the rest of the notaries can broadcast

[02-Feb-19 07:53 AM] Alright#0419
no matter what, 1 notarization per block

[02-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing them faster gets them no gain...

[02-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they just get paid more dust

[02-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing tehm slower gets them the same pay in less dust

[02-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT doing invalid one gets them extra pay

[02-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which seems backwards.. but I dnt really figure out how to prevent this

[02-Feb-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
invlaid notarisation dont count towards coutns though

[02-Feb-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or at least shouldnt... so making them  would be almsot automatic loss of spot

[02-Feb-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
dpow assumes notaries won't collude anyway

[02-Feb-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
to some extent at least

[02-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... but dPoW doesnt create coins

[02-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[02-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that wont work

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] Alright#0419
You call it an exit scam, but as soon as a group of notaries started doing it, we would see it.

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this way is fine... I just need to get the height from OP_RETURN...

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] Alright#0419
and they can't get more coins than normal

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
people wont do it... its way to obvious

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
THEY CAN GET MORE

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fuck

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] Alright#0419
normal being how many coins are allocated for the full notary network

[02-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by making invalid ntoarisations

[02-Feb-19 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
if notaries combined normally get 1000/LABS per 10000 blocks

[02-Feb-19 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
colluding notaries can't get more than 1000/LABS per 10000 blocks

[02-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it determines when the last notaristion happened by VALID notarisations... but a notarisation as just a tx signed by min sigs

[02-Feb-19 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
and we would see them doing it immediately

[02-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless I add a new data poiunt... fo invalid notarisations or half valid notarisations

[02-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they create half valid ntoarisations

[02-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then they can get paid extra

[02-Feb-19 07:58 AM] Alright#0419
if notaries combined normally get 1000/LABS per 10000 blocks
colluding notaries can't get more than 1000/LABS per 10000 blocks

[02-Feb-19 07:58 AM] Alright#0419
is this not true?

[02-Feb-19 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its not.... because it can only know the last notatised height by a VALID ntoarisation

[02-Feb-19 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you cant know a noptarisation is VALID... when you create the coinbase

[02-Feb-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can only know it was signed by minsigs

[02-Feb-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I can get OP_RETURN and try to validate it in there

[02-Feb-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but this just creates the same problem as before...

[02-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
an invalid tx being pinged around the mempool invalidating every block it gets into

[02-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or maybe not ?

[02-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Alright#0419
rejecttomemorypool?

[02-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wait... maybe it can just extract block hash

[02-Feb-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it that does nto match height

[02-Feb-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then fail to create coinbase

[02-Feb-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then validation would never check it

[02-Feb-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bwecaus the coinabse isnt there to check

[02-Feb-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would just be a normal block

[02-Feb-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I ned to work out excatly what function is doing the notarisation validation... then call that in the miner to see if the notarisatino is valid

[02-Feb-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its not valid... then don create the coinbase

[02-Feb-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to get the noarized height anyway... so I have to work out hwo to decode OP_RETURN

[02-Feb-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so much effort on what is most likely a non-problem. just count notarizations. have some voting mechanism to counteract whatever rare collusion/attack scenario is supposed to be possible. You wont be able to code against all the collusion attacks so that needs to be done outside the blockchain. Basically you are trying to solve an impossible problem, that is why it isnt having a solution

[02-Feb-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
I find it best to avoid trying to solve impossible problems, saves a lot of time

[02-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem isnt jsut collusion.. if there is a ug that creates an invalid ntoarisation with the current code base the chain will just stop

[02-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every block that notarisation is included it will be invalid

[02-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant be like that

[02-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This solution will work...

[02-Feb-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as I can work out how to checkif a notarisation is valid when the block is created

[02-Feb-19 09:58 AM] jorian#4555
`./start.sh -reindex` is that a thing already?

[02-Feb-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt work

[02-Feb-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
./assetchains -reindex

[02-Feb-19 09:58 AM] jorian#4555
i did it manually

[02-Feb-19 09:58 AM] jorian#4555
yes, but might be nice

[02-Feb-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was onyl from that one bug... you can use ./assetchains to start it manually with reindex

[02-Feb-19 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
i did it inside assetchains actually since i wasn't sure the argument would be read

[02-Feb-19 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
anyways, everything is good again, had some stalled chains

👍 

[02-Feb-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
assetchains script takes override args... just start.sh doestn pass it anything..

{Reactions}
👍 

[02-Feb-19 10:00 AM] jorian#4555
so the holdup for LABS is the validation of a notarisation?

[02-Feb-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of...

[02-Feb-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have what I think will work here... but tis slwo going...

[02-Feb-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The NOTARYTEST chain is working perfectly

[02-Feb-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT it could stop if a ntoarisation that is invalid is created for whatever reason

[02-Feb-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what started as a  prety simple change... has ended up a bit mroe complex lol

[02-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jorian#4555
a notarisation that is invalid

[02-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jorian#4555
what are the chances of that happening?

[02-Feb-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically... need to check the notarisation is valid int eh miner...

[02-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jorian#4555
and what exactly is an invalid notarisation?

[02-Feb-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very small... unless someone cahnges iguana and gets the code on 6 notary ndoes

[02-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jorian#4555
so a collusion of 6 labs nodes?
