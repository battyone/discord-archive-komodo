its a monster that start.sh ... easily the best script Ive ever written

[15-Oct-18 01:36 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant if you have a notary running, please run `./start.sh`

[15-Oct-18 01:36 AM] Alright#0419
we're updating STAKEDED to latest FSM branch, so we can test new confs thing and latest channels code

[15-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also I told libscott to use starkeded to test MoMoM I will need to tell him not to now and kill it on that VM .

[15-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is still other chains with balance he cna use.

[15-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so no worries, just I jad the most of ED

[15-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
start script is nooiccceeeeee

[15-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
great fucking job

[15-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
haven't been paying attention to everything you've been doing to it

[15-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs the sudo part removed .

[15-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was only needed the first time it was run, to make the notatries backwards compatible with it

[15-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
updates the symlinks

[15-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its safe to say all notaries have run it at least once after this update and I will rip that part out.

[15-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it can pretty much be cron'd or some other trigger. ...

[15-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for now its still using git for assetchains.json

[15-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btwe

[15-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
cronning it allows us to do a lot of interesting things

[15-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
add chains on the fly, being one of those things

[15-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hell yes it does ... need to the 100% it never gets stuck though, i found a few bugs so far where it cna get stuck and fixed them ... looking pretty close to perfect atm.

[15-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
should I work on getting multiple oracle providers working for oraclefetch

[15-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
it works great right now, but it's hard coded to a single publisher

[15-Oct-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for now thats ok... but we need a URL that also retunrs it, incase the blockchain is not avalible somehere. The both can be added to start.sh using one if the other fails.

[15-Oct-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its on my list, basically had 2 days off over weekend.

[15-Oct-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
starting to get too many jobs on the trello all in doing phase atm lol... need to workout what are proritys .. libscott was going to start investiogating MoMoM problems sometime today. ðŸ˜„

[15-Oct-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
although this streaming chain is probably a good thing to work on while waiting for him, seems it took 3 days already to make it, and its unused.

[15-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think any block under 1.5MB in size is not allowed by CPU miner or consensus rule ...

[15-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then ahve all notaries CPU mine with 1 core by default ... data bandwidth should be quite huge ... Although as james said, it would require a new chain to be spawned for each stream, then remove it from notaries afterwards, as the data size would just get out of hand really fast.

[15-Oct-18 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
well good thing we have auto-adding chains working

[15-Oct-18 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
I can try it with pictures, just have to research how to render them

[15-Oct-18 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
converting to hex and back is really simple

[15-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will use the current chain to bandwidth test it, just useing normal TX to fill blocks.

[15-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then work on changing the miner and conesnsus rules to use block size instead of TX count.

[15-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
just loop chatsend with max size messages

[15-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
and then see how fast you can receive them on the other side

[15-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you want to use opreturn instead of normal TX ?

[15-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
huh?

[15-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess I can try that ... might need 10 nodes sending to fill it but

[15-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure exactly

[15-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
how would we use normal TXs to broadcast data?

[15-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the wallet.dat will slow to a crawl at some point and it might stop streaming

[15-Oct-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
without OP_RETURN of some sort

[15-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just wanted to bandwidth test the chain .. flill mempool to 50mb

[15-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see how many blocks it mines in a minute

[15-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if that is fast enough

[15-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it doesnt break

[15-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we cna try sending opraturn full

[15-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from 1 node and see if it can even send faste enough to fill the chains... my guess is the wallet.dat will break befor eany meaningful length of video is broadcast

[15-Oct-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not the end of the world though ... just use the dAPP to send the TX using something like txblaster to loop a single utxo to attach the OPRETURN too

[15-Oct-18 02:03 AM] Alright#0419
this turned into a mess *real quick* ðŸ˜‚

@blackjok3r @Alright tried chanls on b1 w1

[15-Oct-18 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
ok, we updated STAKEDED

[15-Oct-18 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
build latest blackjok3r branch and use that for channels testing on STAKEDED if you want

[15-Oct-18 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
has the latest channels code in it

[15-Oct-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  I made some progress here on oraclesinfo

[15-Oct-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im just really noob at it, so tis taking a while to implemtn fix

[15-Oct-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no check at all, for publisher

[15-Oct-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I need to add a check for if last publisher != publisher

[15-Oct-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will stop it adding everything to each array I am pretty sure ... atm it just adds everything to each array

[15-Oct-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm this seems harder than i fairt thaught, gues my brain is still not working properly today ðŸ˜‚

Did someone spam the crap out of the chat oracle on STAKEDB1?

[15-Oct-18 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
not a big deal if you did, just curious why

[15-Oct-18 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
why does it need to have a block of a certain size?

[15-Oct-18 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
just have it make blocks as it makes them

[15-Oct-18 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
as long we we are getting multiple blocks per second, it will all get to all the nodes

[15-Oct-18 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
figured if we don't use full block size, we will be wasting bandwidth

[15-Oct-18 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
so 5 blocks with 1 tx each or 1 block with 5 txs

[15-Oct-18 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
1 block with 5 txs will be less space

[15-Oct-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i agree on having a larger min block size... if the chain is going to either be under crazy data spam... or doing nothing

[15-Oct-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why have it mine only 1 tx per block?

[15-Oct-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also with all notaries competing.. I dont know what will happen

[15-Oct-18 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
I disagree

[15-Oct-18 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
a block not filled doesnt waste bandwidth

[15-Oct-18 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming the next block can be created

[15-Oct-18 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
by having such a restriction you will guarantee that the end of the stream will get stuck

[15-Oct-18 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
We aren't taking data from confirmed txs rather the mempool as they come in

[15-Oct-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but it needs to confirm at some point to process it

[15-Oct-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
basically the block confirmation is the archiving of the stream

[15-Oct-18 05:12 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[15-Oct-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
does it matter if you archive it in 100kb or 1MB chunks?

[15-Oct-18 05:12 AM] Alright#0419
so why not do that in as less space as possible?

[15-Oct-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
less space?

[15-Oct-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
data is 99%

[15-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
block overhead is ignorable, that is why i ignore it

[15-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the fewer restrictions there are the fewer restrictions there are

[15-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
just because you are able to make consensus changes doesnt mean you should whenever you can

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
like with the -dpowconfs, I could have done that via consensus change, but it was less impact to do is as a per node configuration

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
always make the smallest change that does the job

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] Alright#0419
No consensus change needed as far as I know

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise you are changing things more than you have to

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] Alright#0419
just stream data to mempool and let it confirm?

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
sure

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] Alright#0419
no need for fast blocks or anything like that

[15-Oct-18 05:14 AM] Alright#0419
or full blocks

[15-Oct-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
no need for full blocks, but fast blocks are needed

[15-Oct-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That depends how big the mepool can get befor eit crashes

[15-Oct-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
2MB/minute wont be enough bandwidth

[15-Oct-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think fast blocks are needed

[15-Oct-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the mempool gets to 3GB

[15-Oct-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the block level bandwidth needs to be more than the dapp usage of bandwidth

[15-Oct-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and takes hours to empty ...
