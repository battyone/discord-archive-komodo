It might be from trying to split utxos.

[03-Nov-18 12:40 AM] CrisF#3405
utxosplitter is giving ```Error: couldnt create duplicates tx``` for both.

Just woke up guys really needed that sleep

[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When I went to bed norarisations on all chains are not working very good

[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also they could be stalled of blocks too

[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will sort it, there are bound to be problems

[03-Nov-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can't see alrights notary I might get another one of mine up on vps I think we are a little low on notaries what are workings

[03-Nov-18 01:51 AM] CrisF#3405
It's doing the same now for `2169`

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm having some wallet issues trying to fix so can make utxos for 2 chains. My NN is off-ans-on as a result.

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how do you confirm staking is active??

[03-Nov-18 01:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
like, do I have to `setgenerate true 0` everytime I ./start?

[03-Nov-18 01:54 AM] CrisF#3405
getmininginfo

[03-Nov-18 01:55 AM] CrisF#3405
It can be set `-gen -genproclimit=0`

[03-Nov-18 01:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure in ./start though.

do getbalance64 RPC call

[03-Nov-18 01:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and how to best spread across segids?

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and if notary staking, can it still fund notarisations?

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would not stake on notary

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats a very bad idea

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lol

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It cna still notarise , but might not splitfund

[03-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it willl stop notariseing

[03-Nov-18 01:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, I guess staking on pool might also inhibit payment capability?

[03-Nov-18 02:00 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r I wasn't able to split 50 coins with 👆 
It said sending `0`coins.  Is the minimum 64 coins to split?

[03-Nov-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really you need a seperate staking node

[03-Nov-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will attemptto build some VMs and some script for staking that are easy today

[03-Nov-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my surrent staker is horribly complicated

[03-Nov-18 02:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Saw the utxosplitter had an update.  I just ran it and it returned 2 chains with no utxos, but it didn't try and split any.

[03-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I justchange the maximum size

[03-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there are no blocks happening to confirm the last split it will wait an hour until the tx times out

[03-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It cannot split unconfirmed utxos

[03-Nov-18 02:04 AM] CrisF#3405
I had 2 duplicates earlier.

[03-Nov-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All 4 of my migrates bailed after 60 mins of import .. either all chains stopped or we have a MAJOR issue

[03-Nov-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[03-Nov-18 02:06 AM] CrisF#3405
I haven't been able to get funds sent to KLF. (normal send)

[03-Nov-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
worked it out

[03-Nov-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana does not do MoMoM notaris for CFEK chains

[03-Nov-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
migtrates CANNOT work

[03-Nov-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we cna fix this though

[03-Nov-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I need to get a node up with the stats script on all chains, so we cna easily see if they are stalling

[03-Nov-18 02:08 AM] CrisF#3405
That would be very useful.

[03-Nov-18 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes the stats script is extremly useful for PoS chains ... wihtout it we are really guessing

[03-Nov-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Problem is I put my notary on the node that normally does stats ... have to have a think about how best to do this, maybe my notary canjust do stats, doesnt seem like ti will cause any issues, but the start.sh will need to be changed a bit

[03-Nov-18 02:19 AM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Could you please let me know if the pos64splitter works for you?

had to populate list.py manually

[03-Nov-18 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
did he put explorers up ?

[03-Nov-18 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would relaly help to see if chains stopped

So we have blocks ... What we need is an update to iguana

[03-Nov-18 02:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
um... I pointed a GPU at it for a bit to see if it would move...

[03-Nov-18 02:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it did. I stopped gpu

[03-Nov-18 02:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might be lagging due to that

[03-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool... best not to leave high hash rate on it

[03-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So at least we know chains are moving, even if they are a little slow

[03-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will work on iguana update, then we need 4 ndoes to update, as its a consensus change to iguana

[03-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
old nodes will stop notarising with us

[03-Nov-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Nov-18 02:58 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm only seeing 4 nodes in mask anyhow.  You see more?

[03-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no we only have 4 ... and no staked things were active in iguana

[03-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is why migrates dont work

[03-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and also why it was doing freq > 10 instead of 5

[03-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Good thing is though, is that supress is working for us now

[03-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I changed it to every 3 KMD blocks, this will help a lot, with notariations being out of order

For the pool you cannot mine if it is staking

[03-Nov-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Same here

[03-Nov-18 03:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Shall we all stop staking FEK then?

[03-Nov-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe its something to do with the steamer code that was merged

[03-Nov-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant stake and mine on the same node... as long as your not doing that than its ok

[03-Nov-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you stop staking the chain will stall

[03-Nov-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its moving, but the % is screwed thats all

[03-Nov-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not an issue for now... but we need to fix it

[03-Nov-18 03:44 AM] CrisF#3405
I mean to lower the %.  Or does it just need more mining?

[03-Nov-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The miner isnt working properly  or yes, we need more hash rate

[03-Nov-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will figure ut out today at some point... need to get notarisations working first

[03-Nov-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one thing at a time
