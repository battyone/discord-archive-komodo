about 8 hours left until entropy is revealed

[19-May-19 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
if there was anyone else interested, let them know

[19-May-19 06:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
thank you

[19-May-19 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
I guess that's against your best interest though üòÇ

[19-May-19 06:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
why?

[19-May-19 06:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
no.. the more the merrier

[19-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
right now you have a 50% chance

[19-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
the more people, the less likely you will be top 2

[19-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
or well, bottom two kind of

[19-May-19 06:56 PM] Alright#0419
it's sha256(blockhash + handle + message)

I had troubles but I finally managed to get a new VM, I followed StakeNotary readme (KMD is synced and assetchains are under sync). I'm having a small issue with python and slickrpc. I searched this discord and google, I tried few fixes but it didn't work. Do you know how I can run NNvote.py ? I'm on ubuntu and it is a new VM (dedicated for KMDLabs setup).
```python NNvote.py                           Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "NNvote.py", line 2, in <module>
    import lib
  File "/home/administrator/StakedNotary/lib.py", line 11, in <module>
    from slickrpc import Proxy
ImportError: No module named slickrpc```

[19-May-19 08:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
`ImportError: No module named slickrpc` your issue is pretty obvious

[19-May-19 08:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
did you install setuptools?

[19-May-19 08:55 PM] phm87#7395
I followed the readme, I didn't install setuptools, I'll install it thank you

[19-May-19 08:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
```sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3 libgnutls28-dev libssl-dev python3-pip

pip3 install setuptools wheel base58 slick-bitcoinrpc requests python-bitcoinlib```

[19-May-19 08:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
btw, you don't need to sync kmd and assetchains for the lottery

Not enough channels on this discord

[19-May-19 09:49 PM] Alright#0419
yea we just deleted a bunch

[19-May-19 09:49 PM] Alright#0419
come back in a month, we should have a couple hundred more

[19-May-19 09:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@phm87  `python NNvote.py` I think you could just `./NNvote.py` instead

[19-May-19 09:51 PM] phm87#7395
with the dependancies suggested by @mrlynch  it works now

[19-May-19 09:51 PM] phm87#7395
thank you @PHBA2061

[19-May-19 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
either `python3 NNvote.py` or just `./NNvote.py`

[19-May-19 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
the shebang specifies python3 anyway

no worries @phm87, doesn't matter as long as it's before the deadline timestamp

[19-May-19 09:57 PM] phm87#7395
What should I do after the PR ?

[19-May-19 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
wait üòõ

[19-May-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
you can test out the verify thing if you want

[19-May-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
like it says input the blockhash

[19-May-19 09:58 PM] phm87#7395
Rrrrmmm I was excited to setup a new iguana with some assetchains

[19-May-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
but you can input anything and it will use what you input as entropy

[19-May-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
lol sorry man

[19-May-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
we'll be reworking the CFEK cluster to be a separate set on notaries

[19-May-19 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
that will be like the "testnet" that can change keys whenever

[19-May-19 09:59 PM] Anthony#6143
your telling me there is a python script to handle this technical vote

[19-May-19 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
the LABS keys will change every 2 months if we have new participants

[19-May-19 09:59 PM] phm87#7395
you explained me a little bit in private about KMDLabs notaries

[19-May-19 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
Yes Anthony?

[19-May-19 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
look at the code for the verification, it's dead simple

[19-May-19 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
dapps are fairly straight forward to code in python with the oracles CC

[19-May-19 10:01 PM] Anthony#6143
You are all on a higher educational level than me

[19-May-19 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
the whole focus of LABS is to share the knowledge

[19-May-19 10:02 PM] Anthony#6143
I need a komodo binary

[19-May-19 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
you need to build it

[19-May-19 10:02 PM] Anthony#6143
takes too long even when i press the turbo button

[19-May-19 10:03 PM] Anthony#6143
joking joking, its compiling

[19-May-19 10:03 PM] phm87#7395
I used a bootstrap to sync more quickly

[19-May-19 10:03 PM] Anthony#6143
I was informed we dont need to sync

[19-May-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419

don't need to sync KMD

[19-May-19 10:03 PM] Anthony#6143
Im using this

[19-May-19 10:03 PM] Anthony#6143
./komodod -ac_algo=verushash11 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_name=CFEKORC -ac_reward=1000000000000 -ac_blocktime=1800 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_cc=102 -pubkey=<YOUR PUBKEY> &

[19-May-19 10:03 PM] Anthony#6143
and my pubkey is what from an address?

[19-May-19 10:04 PM] Anthony#6143
getnewaddress validateaddress grab the pubkey put it there?

[19-May-19 10:04 PM] Anthony#6143
we are using the pubkey because we have to sign something correct

[19-May-19 10:04 PM] phm87#7395
I made the validateaddress on komodo itself, I think it is the same

[19-May-19 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
start it with `./komodod -ac_algo=verushash11 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_name=CFEKORC -ac_reward=1000000000000 -ac_blocktime=1800 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_cc=102`

then `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC validateaddress $(komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC getnewaddress)`

[19-May-19 10:04 PM] Anthony#6143
well we need the private key to sign but we can see whats going on later

[19-May-19 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
it'll output a pubkey

[19-May-19 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
from there you can either restart the daemon with `-pubkey=<pubkey>` or do `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC setpubkey <pubkey>`

[19-May-19 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
if you do setpubkey, don't lose track of it

[19-May-19 10:05 PM] phm87#7395
I directly start the CFEKORC with pubkey set (retrieved on komodo), maybe I voted too quickly

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
You're good, everything set @phm87

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] phm87#7395
I'll check in blockchain is my things are into it (but it seems OK in the python script)

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Anthony#6143
is this the pubkey

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
where did you get that though? why is it in caps?

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Anthony#6143
uncompressed

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Anthony#6143
winzip it

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
use compressed

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Anthony#6143
everything I do is CAPS

[19-May-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419

Just to give Anthony a bit of an introduction, he's a dev for CMM. Interested in learning about dpow

[19-May-19 10:07 PM] Anthony#6143
I need DPOW

[19-May-19 10:07 PM] phm87#7395
Oh CMM Commercium ?

[19-May-19 10:08 PM] Anthony#6143
Commercium needs DPOW not me actually

[19-May-19 10:08 PM] phm87#7395
I discussed it when we added it on zpool

[19-May-19 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
forking labs is the way to go... I know I've said it a million freaking times

[19-May-19 10:08 PM] phm87#7395
I can add it on my pool if it still works there

[19-May-19 10:08 PM] Anthony#6143
There is a pool on the github which is setup out of the box but uses znomp

[19-May-19 10:09 PM] Anthony#6143
still compiling..

[19-May-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
adding dpow to the existing CMM zcash2.02 fork will take like 6 months of work

[19-May-19 10:09 PM] Anthony#6143
Should start now

[19-May-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
migrating CMM to komodo codebase and doing it is like a month's work

[19-May-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
talking about him running his own dpow network btw

[19-May-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
not the normal 3rd party integration work

[19-May-19 10:11 PM] Anthony#6143
There is six figure software coming out for CMM, plus Im focusing on some other things

[19-May-19 10:11 PM] Alright#0419
well running a LABS NN will force you to learn how exactly dpow works

[19-May-19 10:11 PM] Alright#0419
good place to start
