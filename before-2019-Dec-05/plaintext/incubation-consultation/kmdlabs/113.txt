we could use them to start paying per notarization right now?

[24-Nov-18 07:24 AM] Alright#0419
on CFEKLAMEDUCKS

[24-Nov-18 07:26 AM] Alright#0419
we just need to be very clear where they came from and what we did with them

[24-Nov-18 07:26 AM] Alright#0419
and be objective about it

[24-Nov-18 07:27 AM] Alright#0419
Cris and smk did tonnes of work. They do deserve some coins for it. I'll make that happen from my own stash, but there are others who have done work as well. We can't just choose who to give them to ourselves

[24-Nov-18 07:28 AM] Alright#0419
changes between snapshot and airdrop should be absolutely minimal

[24-Nov-18 07:28 AM] Alright#0419
and clear

[24-Nov-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can we make them a bounty.. and have everyone just put in a calim ? good test for that process ?

[24-Nov-18 07:28 AM] Alright#0419
oh that works

[24-Nov-18 07:29 AM] Alright#0419
I'll dump them into multisig address after launch

[24-Nov-18 07:31 AM] Alright#0419
Ah wait, the coins for bounties don't come from multisig address

[24-Nov-18 07:31 AM] Alright#0419
so I'll not include them in airdrop

[24-Nov-18 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In this case they will need to ...

[24-Nov-18 07:31 AM] Alright#0419
then we'll create the chain with them again

[24-Nov-18 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess ust burn them... and recreate

[24-Nov-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess we need to find out the max M of a multisig ? can it be unnlimited ?

[24-Nov-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
I think there is max N

[24-Nov-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
not M

[24-Nov-18 07:33 AM] Alright#0419
max is based on the script size I think

[24-Nov-18 07:33 AM] Alright#0419
M and N can be the same number

[24-Nov-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah so the bounties can be every notary address multisig and the maximum of N

[24-Nov-18 07:34 AM] Alright#0419
is what I mean

[24-Nov-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think N is max at 14 but im not sure wher eI go tthat information

[24-Nov-18 07:34 AM] Alright#0419
I think it's best to have signers that are not notaries

[24-Nov-18 07:35 AM] Alright#0419
might be hard to find people interested in doing that though

[24-Nov-18 07:37 AM] gt#2812
so today is a test chain, right?

{Reactions}
üëç 

[24-Nov-18 07:37 AM] Alright#0419
so launch will be something like this 
block 1, mined to multisig
block3, coins transferred from multisig
block4, airdrop
block 128, stop chain
block 129, burn all BRs up until this point

[24-Nov-18 07:37 AM] Alright#0419
p2p port opened and params made public

[24-Nov-18 07:39 AM] Alright#0419
@gt you'll be able to start (attempting) to notarize in 2 hours and 20 minutes

[24-Nov-18 07:40 AM] Alright#0419
will likely take an hour or so before we get notarizations

[24-Nov-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already have 150 blocks here ü§∑

[24-Nov-18 07:40 AM] Alright#0419
yea I didn't bother to do the last 2 steps for this chain

[24-Nov-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
up side is that its syncin just fine ... managed 2 nodes in 2 locaitons

[24-Nov-18 07:40 AM] Alright#0419
as I'm testing stuff

[24-Nov-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok no worries.

[24-Nov-18 07:41 AM] gt#2812
so you guys are test running what will happen with labs

[24-Nov-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
yes

{Reactions}
üëå 

[24-Nov-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
along with determining mainnet notaries

[24-Nov-18 07:41 AM] gt#2812
yep yep

[24-Nov-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for now it seems its easy to be in top 20 .. plenty of nodes missing

[24-Nov-18 07:42 AM] Alright#0419
yea I don't expect to see 20 for a couple days

[24-Nov-18 07:43 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't mean you should slack off and end up a lame duck though üòõ

[24-Nov-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still need to work out the process for reelection to ... I likeed having a teird thing, where some nodes can be elected for a year, and other spots rotate each 2 months, keeping top nodes.

[24-Nov-18 07:44 AM] Alright#0419
don't like it

[24-Nov-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Nov-18 07:44 AM] Alright#0419
or well maybe I just don't understand what you mean

[24-Nov-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have an election for x% of nodes wo are elected for a year, unless they choose to leave at som point.

[24-Nov-18 07:44 AM] Alright#0419
why?

[24-Nov-18 07:44 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
this node RJPJBbHcm5mkAxhkkERHRfEE9Cvkr4Euoi RJPJBbHcm5mkAxhkkERHRfEE9Cvkr4Euoi is not official notary

[24-Nov-18 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then y% are autoelected each 2 months based on notarisations

[24-Nov-18 07:45 AM] gt#2812
i think it leaves people to maybe focus on the project but not having to worry about performance ?

[24-Nov-18 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the pubkeys were asked to be checked multiple ties @kmdkrazy

[24-Nov-18 07:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
is the json file going to be updated?

[24-Nov-18 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 07:45 AM] Alright#0419
What is the pubkey for that address?

[24-Nov-18 07:45 AM] Alright#0419
do `validateaddress` on it

[24-Nov-18 07:46 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

It's a way to help ensure the strength of the network and also the strength of the platform.  They mutually benefit.

[24-Nov-18 07:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
-+let me quadruple check this

[24-Nov-18 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only problem with havng notaries only on preforemance... is you can end up with one person having all the notaries ...

[24-Nov-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and as we use notaris to deciude the createion ogf chains, and there for coins....

[24-Nov-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is very very bad

[24-Nov-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there needs to be some elected %

[24-Nov-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO

[24-Nov-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you cant have an election every 2 months

[24-Nov-18 07:49 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy can you pm me the email address you sent it from?

[24-Nov-18 07:49 AM] Alright#0419
I can't seem to find it. I think we left the key you had previously in the array

[24-Nov-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its still possible to chane his pubkey ... as long as @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  has not notaised yet

[24-Nov-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
his old key was wrong ... i assumeed it has been corrected

[24-Nov-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never checked it .

[24-Nov-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can still change it if need be ...

[24-Nov-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181

where are the explorers at?

[24-Nov-18 08:10 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
wherever you build them at :trollface:

[24-Nov-18 08:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[24-Nov-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no ... Alright didnt do them... he told me he had a way of doing explorers that was easy, so i never made them easy

[24-Nov-18 08:13 AM] Alright#0419

[24-Nov-18 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
