its a vote by non stake hoplders (and stake holders) as per what genie said.... then a lottery

[06-Feb-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the vote is only there

[06-Feb-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to prevent sybil attack

[06-Feb-19 03:56 AM] Alright#0419
non stake holders meaning?

[06-Feb-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not really sure it was determined how that would work

[06-Feb-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its mostly there to choose who can run

[06-Feb-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ie... prevent 1 person making 100 accounts

[06-Feb-19 03:58 AM] Alright#0419
stakeholders choose who is eligible for lottery?

[06-Feb-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that can work I guess

[06-Feb-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you cant let notaries have too much stake vote

[06-Feb-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really a way to prevent that

[06-Feb-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to prevent 1 person making 100 accounts and winnjing lotterty

[06-Feb-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
we put a deposit on the lottery maybe?

[06-Feb-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I suggested that

[06-Feb-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it seemed to get lost in the convo

[06-Feb-19 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r ac_notarypay seems solid, yes?

[06-Feb-19 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it appears to be

[06-Feb-19 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
just some pentesting of it and we're about ready?

[06-Feb-19 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
theree is only one possible way it can break and I think I know how to fix it... but it doent seem to need fixing as its working

[06-Feb-19 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
how?

[06-Feb-19 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if an invalid ntoarisation is made

[06-Feb-19 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it could prvent a miner creating a valid block.

[06-Feb-19 04:05 AM] Alright#0419
invalid how?

[06-Feb-19 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just eeds to count a few times how many times it tried to creat the block, if it cant then flag that tx as bad... and not include it

[06-Feb-19 04:05 AM] Alright#0419
how does one create an invalid notarization?

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but to create it in the fiorst place... rewquires colluding notaries

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
wrong pubkeys, wrong minsigs?

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very unlikely

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wrong blockhashs

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the OP_RETURN data to be incorrect

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
well

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its so ujlikely... that I dont think a fix is needed until it happens

[06-Feb-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
it's just preventing a miner from putting a notarization in their chain that doesn't match their current chain

[06-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[06-Feb-19 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
so it indicates a larger problem

[06-Feb-19 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
you wouldn't want to continue to mine blocks on that chain anyway

[06-Feb-19 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
so it's a good thing that the miner would fail

[06-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes exactly.... I dont think notaries are going to collude to break there own chains

[06-Feb-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it happens we can try a fix, I already know basically how to do it... but I dont want to do the fix if its never required

[06-Feb-19 04:08 AM] Alright#0419
it's a feature, not a bug

[06-Feb-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will slow things doen, and likely introduce more problems

[06-Feb-19 04:08 AM] Alright#0419
similar to dpowconfs for a CEX

[06-Feb-19 04:08 AM] Alright#0419
halts deposits because there is a larger problem

[06-Feb-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep

[06-Feb-19 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
this halts mining because there is a larger problem

[06-Feb-19 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... it gives more power to ntoaris than they had before... but they are unlikely to use this power becasuse if will only hurt them selvs

[06-Feb-19 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```Alright Today at 9:37 PM
...We have a stake holder vote ...what exactly was the problem with this?
blackjok3rToday at 9:38 PM
ask genie```
```ComputerGenie „ÉÑLast Thursday at 9:21 PM
...No, they aren't "forced" to, they are just "forced" to explain next election to people why they should keep a job they choose not to  do to the best of their ability

What's "wrong" with it is that you said __you__ didn't want it üôÑ

[06-Feb-19 04:20 AM] Alright#0419
Sorry, I've been very scatter brained the last week or so. I'm not arguing one way or the other. Just trying to understand both

[06-Feb-19 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
To clear any misconceptions, I'm squarely in favor of a vote system where stakeholders (especially outside of our little sphere) have valued input and there's not a point where it can be argued that notaries have their jobs *just* because they are "friends" of those involved.

[06-Feb-19 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
The one thing I am admittedly against is changing the cycle to once per year once we hit 64 nodes

[06-Feb-19 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
we rely on actively involved notaries

[06-Feb-19 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we dont need to do that... its just some random thing I said in pages and pages of text

[06-Feb-19 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every 2 months, notaries who preform super badly will be removed by vote of other ntoaries

[06-Feb-19 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think this should ever change

[06-Feb-19 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as teh rules for the vote to be called are clearly defined

[06-Feb-19 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and never changed

[06-Feb-19 04:28 AM] Alright#0419
objectiveness works, but inability to change something does not IMO

[06-Feb-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well I guess.... a stake hodler vote can be madfe to change the rules... as james saiud not eveything can be on chain

[06-Feb-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there has to be some excternal forces at work

[06-Feb-19 04:31 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm not particularly married to any idea of how long, but I am married to the idea that we need as decentralized a "hiring practice" as feasibly possible and (as discussed earlier) that utility producing NNs cannot ever be booted for merely being unpopular (the safeguard for that also aids against collusion in certain instances, I think)

[06-Feb-19 04:32 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
afaik, we all agree on the latter

[06-Feb-19 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It is 100% possibble for 99% of notaries to collude and block one notaries ip address to oust him/her ... I dont think that can be prevented

[06-Feb-19 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but will it ewver happen?

[06-Feb-19 04:33 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
that's why I said "certain" and not "all" üòõ

üï∫ 

[06-Feb-19 04:34 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
but I think that every non-hindering check we can put in place, is a long-term bonus

[06-Feb-19 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed.. as long as its not over compicated... simple rules must be used.

[06-Feb-19 04:35 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes

[06-Feb-19 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we all want the same thing here, and we are extremly close to a working solution

[06-Feb-19 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
good, now code it up today and we can launch tomorrow üôÇ

_just got home from bowling at 10pm and is going to bed before 11_

[06-Feb-19 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Regardless ... I dont think there needs to be any more code written, we just need to test properly the code that is aready done... this politic stuff is off chain

[06-Feb-19 04:41 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
did you ever sort out why I can't sync LABST?

[06-Feb-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm no... I thaught theproblem was that it was stalled

[06-Feb-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will try sync here and see what happens

@LabsAssistant Joker and I just killed all existing chains and started 3 new ones. Notaries please `./stop.sh`,`git pull`, `./start.sh`

[06-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
Also, if you have time, please do migrates. Once we're confident that migrates and momom are still working with ac_ccenable and ac_notarypay, I believe we're ready for launch

[06-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
still need to decide notary change mechanism prior to launch

[06-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
so priority right now is test the hell out of migrates one last time and discuss notary change mechanism
