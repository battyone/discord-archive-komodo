launch, mine genesis and notarypay?

[20-Apr-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
umm yeah I think just suying the same exact things as CFEKNK/KN but with a diff name and supply will suffice. The chains appeared to sync for me, so I think I managed to port all the code correctly. But its right now in the wrong repo.

[20-Apr-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Give me a few hours.

[20-Apr-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll let you know when its ready.

Hi, here to help. Let me know what I can do.  ( @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator will you be sorting out the chains? )

[20-Apr-19 04:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Made an ondemand chain, which mines coinbases the exact size fo the TX_FEE so paymetns CC was createing txns with no vouts only OP_RETURNS and it was failing every validation... So confused for so long.

[20-Apr-19 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thank god I fixed that lol.

[20-Apr-19 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ill do the merge now and come back to this

[20-Apr-19 05:00 AM] CrisF#3405
No problem üëç

Good you sorted it üé≤

The only problem I have it I dont know how to merge this to KMDLabs master as it will conflict and explode ... trying to see if I can go back l;ike a2 months and then merge it to there, but sure you can delete masterbranch though so we might be stuck and need to delete the whole KMDLabs/komodo then refork üò¶

[20-Apr-19 05:07 AM] CrisF#3405
No worries, no big rush or anything.

[20-Apr-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather just get it done lol. I think I worked it out. I did merge the entire of the old master to zuluplatform to back it up in case I screw this up.

[20-Apr-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
testing that it builds now. Then new chains can be made.

[20-Apr-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wipe out assetchains.json. Make 2 new chains. A LABS testchain might be a good idea with same params we are going to use. But I think we need Alright for that. So for now make something similar to CFEK NK/NK.

[20-Apr-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
use ac_nk=77,3 to make chains safe from nasty miners rather than PoS because you need less nodes that way üòâ 
All we need to do is test migrate again. make sure script still works, test migrate of tokens (fungible and non fungible)

[20-Apr-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This should be the home strech to launch a LABS main chain. As long as everything still works that is.

you can really make whatever you like CFEK chains üòÉ Just make sure we can actaully get coins to test with and they are a cluster with each other.

man, dog chewed through my keyboard  cable yesterday. only had it 2 months.
Back on an older mech, it's loud AF.

I really need a better keybvoard, this $50 is terrible.... Was actually nice to use the laptop again the other day.

You may be forced to kill ORKL chain btw... maybe try to sync it with the new build. If its ok. you can keep it.

[20-Apr-19 05:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
looking at this - https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboards/K63-Compact-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-%E2%80%94-CHERRY%C2%AE-MX-Red/p/CH-9115020-NA
backlit + wireless is a thin market

[20-Apr-19 05:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
np, refresh is probably due, will have to dump some oracle data first tho. Wont update that node yet

[20-Apr-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, if you can sync it. Then its fine to keep. There were some problems with orcales due to some changes we made to block index. But if it can sync the chain, then all nodes will just need a reindex and will be ok.

[20-Apr-19 08:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got my main node up, had to delete ~/StakedNotary and ~/komodo, reclone, clear userdata, bootstrap and reindex ACs

[20-Apr-19 08:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
secondary node ==   `[CFEKDIMXY5] ABORTING - CFEKDIMXY5 has no network connections, Help Human! `
tho

[20-Apr-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Those chains need to die.. they are broken beyond repair

[20-Apr-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure an update was pushed for @Alright  to test something, and it changed the magiv values.

[20-Apr-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have reverted it on the new forl, as he never checked it and I wasnt sure if any issues.

[20-Apr-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
New chains, and a bootstrap ofg KMD will be required as I changed the blockindex back, and made it only custom for LABS chains.

jus blew away those folders, rebooting

[20-Apr-19 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you just remove the old chains from assetchains.json everything *should just work*

[20-Apr-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not to say it definatly will, this merge took a few ppl a few days to figure out, its totally possible things are broken in many places.

[20-Apr-19 08:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll update ac.json and go again. got it runnin on one so it builds

Shall I get rid of `NK` & `KN`, along with `DIMXY5 & 6`?

[20-Apr-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes allll new chains. except maybe ORKL

[20-Apr-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it will need a reindex I think..

[20-Apr-19 09:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, I'll keep that.

[20-Apr-19 09:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had no probs with ORKL after reindex

[20-Apr-19 09:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
on either node

[20-Apr-19 09:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
bootstrapping node 2 now, got a new ac_json ready to go. should have the genesis blocks mined soon

What should it be?

[20-Apr-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure. there were no updates to stakednotary. as smk said, maybe need to delete `~/komodo`  reclone and build manually the first go. This was a massiv code change, likry thew auto build is broken until at least buiult once

[20-Apr-19 09:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, cool.  I rm -rf .komodo guts.  Will go manual.

[20-Apr-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no not .komodo

[20-Apr-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`komodo`

[20-Apr-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
