[24-Nov-18 09:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
well, I removed everything yesterday

[24-Nov-18 09:29 AM] CMaurice#1685
trying that now

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
if that doesnt work try git pull from StakedNotary to see if you have something wrong with your update and then delete the bad chain then ./start.sh -

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and that is ALL I have for today----- well this morning

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to do conenct= and also remove the addnodes

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ikely thats the issue

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its syncinf a fork

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont know why there is a fork

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or who is trying to seed it

[24-Nov-18 09:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ther is 2 of them

[24-Nov-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but thatswhat it is

[24-Nov-18 09:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
forked chains

[24-Nov-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to sync manually qith connect=

[24-Nov-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then sto pthe chain and do start.sh

[24-Nov-18 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the forked chain was notarised ... so it precents the longer chain reorging

[24-Nov-18 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its doing exactly what its supposed to do

[24-Nov-18 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This iwas my fault .. tbh I am surprised it just the 1 chain that broke

[24-Nov-18 09:39 AM] CMaurice#1685
mkay so `komodo/master/komodo-cli -connect=103.6.12.112 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_staked=1 -ac_name=CFEKING -ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1 -ac_cc=102 -pubkey=025830ce81bd1301fb67d5872344efa7a9ff99ae85fe1234f18c085db9072b740f` ?

[24-Nov-18 09:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
conenct=     - please explain for future reference

[24-Nov-18 09:39 AM] CMaurice#1685
but that gets me `error: too few parameters`

[24-Nov-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodod not komodo-cli

[24-Nov-18 09:39 AM] CMaurice#1685
oh

[24-Nov-18 09:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Does that need the connect?

[24-Nov-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[24-Nov-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just to et past the problem block

[24-Nov-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it does not

[24-Nov-18 09:40 AM] CMaurice#1685
how do I do that?

[24-Nov-18 09:41 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`conenct= - please explain for future reference`
connect means 'connect to this node and no one else'

[24-Nov-18 09:41 AM] CMaurice#1685
and, uh, I'm laughing: my washing machine has just flooded

[24-Nov-18 09:41 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
connect = <this IP address>???

[24-Nov-18 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
'this' being the node you want to connect to, yes

[24-Nov-18 09:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
then  he needs to put that command in his conf and what IP addrsss?

[24-Nov-18 09:43 AM] CMaurice#1685
I see

[24-Nov-18 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's less work to put in command line, rather than conf

{Reactions}
游눮 

[24-Nov-18 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
because it's generally not a thing to "always" do

[24-Nov-18 09:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i didnt know it would stick

[24-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my a-team notary node uses it 24/7 and its still not in the conf 游땎

[24-Nov-18 09:44 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
unless you know why you would want it to, you don't want it to "stick"

[24-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You ONLY need it to get past the stuck block.

[24-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then remove it immediatly

[24-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gerneally never useit for anything

[24-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unles you know why your doing so

[24-Nov-18 09:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
./komodod  connect = 867.5.309

[24-Nov-18 09:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
is that the command?

[24-Nov-18 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`You ONLY need it to get past the stuck block.`
well, there are other cases for legit use in conf, but if you need those cases you know it and you know *why* you need it

[24-Nov-18 09:46 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_has connect in 3 of his KMD nodes_

[24-Nov-18 09:46 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i missing something simple

[24-Nov-18 09:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybe cause its 430 am

[24-Nov-18 09:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
4:50

[24-Nov-18 09:48 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
used like:
`komodod -ac_name=CFEKING -ac_supply=1000 -ac_staked=1 -ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1 -ac_cc=102 -connect=159.69.201.122`

[24-Nov-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like I said main net ntoary also rus connect= on all chains.

[24-Nov-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and my staker VM used it aswel... but now with fast home system and fiber intenret I iwll just stake with 1 node rather than 8 游땏

[24-Nov-18 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`connect` is used in the place that people overuse `addnode`

{Reactions}
游녧 

[24-Nov-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and like `addnode` it only needs to be used on 1 run

[24-Nov-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
or on specific runs

[24-Nov-18 09:52 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so put it in conf 1 time then deletet it the next ---- for  non command line users

[24-Nov-18 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`for non command line users`
those people don't run NNs :trollface:

[24-Nov-18 09:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
yes they will

[24-Nov-18 09:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[24-Nov-18 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
try to keep track of your first notarization on it

[24-Nov-18 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
won't be too hard for us, just have to look at RXL address

[24-Nov-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I reccomend doing ./stop.sh

[24-Nov-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the ./start.sh

[24-Nov-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181

the walletreset script now is nice and simple and easy ... if utxo split does not work for any reason

[24-Nov-18 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just run the wallet reset script

[24-Nov-18 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will send balance to self
