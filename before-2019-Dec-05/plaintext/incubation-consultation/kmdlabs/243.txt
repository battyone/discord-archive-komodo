latest master

[25-Jan-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
it seems that it can have two different magic values

[25-Jan-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
seems based on how it starts up

[25-Jan-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
sit that and do `ctrl + c`, `enter` over and over

[25-Jan-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
you'll see what I mean

[25-Jan-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
just keep restarting it

[25-Jan-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok checking it

[25-Jan-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
let me check getinfo for each magic value

[25-Jan-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
might give some insight

[25-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I know what it is

[25-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but im not sure how to fix it exactly

`val = ASSETCHAINS_COMMISSION | (((int64_t)ASSETCHAINS_STAKED & 0xff) << 32)`
where ASSETCHAINS_STAKED is actual an int32_t
@jl777c  
Could doing the above sometimes give diffrent values? 
this is to calculate the magic value.

[25-Jan-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either that, or its overflowing something

[25-Jan-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it is cast to int64, so that should have predictable results

[25-Jan-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
different values indicates some uninitialized value

[25-Jan-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because I changed ASSETCHAINS_STAKED to a int32 and then just cast it as 64 so that the magic was backwards compatible... seemed to work. must be something else

[25-Jan-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm its not changin for me ü§î

[25-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
just keep doing it lol

[25-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
works on both of my machines

[25-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
almost always ends up with 18...

[25-Jan-19 11:50 AM] Alright#0419
still can't get it to happen?

[25-Jan-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[25-Jan-19 11:50 AM] Alright#0419
I just triple checked that it's the same exact command running

[25-Jan-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the printout from the conflicting magics is needed: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000005a00000001a005000000f00e1d4d000000a91460087a27868c871c683ec65bda5a26445b440a6187 extralen.113 crc0.3d72a1b1

[25-Jan-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
99% sure that is the bug

[25-Jan-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks

[25-Jan-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  pushed possible fix

[25-Jan-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also pushed code, for LABS fungible chains, any chains not called LABS exactly but LABSxxx.... have 0 comission and 0 block reward hardcoded into the source. No matter what chain params are setm, the coinbase is always exactly 0.

[25-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c the other day when I was testing ac_cclib I believe this happened as well

[25-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
remember when I thought it wouldn't start mining, but it was just the nodes not connected

[25-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
I attributed it to a mistake on my part, but I'm pretty sure this is what happened

[25-Jan-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, same bug would be random based on top of stack values. sorry, i missed the indentation level of the nonz init

[25-Jan-19 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Don't know if related and not user error, but yesterday had different p2p ports (didn't check magic) like this on Marmara.

[25-Jan-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, all chains would have been affected with this bug

{Reactions}
üëå 

[25-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
did marmara project launch a chain?

[25-Jan-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
just test chains for early features

[25-Jan-19 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
Ah damn, been missing out on all the fun

[25-Jan-19 12:30 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, just test chain.  Trying out Tony's TUI.

[25-Jan-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the requirements for MARMARA is still evolving, I am making custom CC for it, but without validations for now

[25-Jan-19 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405

[25-Jan-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think install BOOST as a dep

[25-Jan-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know what these problems are

[25-Jan-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but changing all the includes to hardcoded paths inside the komodo folder doesnt seem like a good solution

[25-Jan-19 12:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Will try `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`

[25-Jan-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah that will fix it I think

going to sound really stupid, but I just want to put this out there

resyncing KMD on my LABS notary... after updating it was just saying all blocks were invalid

[25-Jan-19 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was going to use bootstrap but it seems I should test a full sync to amke sure it can actually sync :S

[25-Jan-19 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then need to setup a nunch of VMs now i've free'd up 36GB of ram.

[25-Jan-19 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how are you mining?

[25-Jan-19 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
using -pubkey ?

[25-Jan-19 02:40 PM] CrisF#3405
On staked.

[25-Jan-19 02:40 PM] CrisF#3405
pubkey should be set.

[25-Jan-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
block 158 is not in the chain

[25-Jan-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it prints that earlier on I think

[25-Jan-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like before the block is validated... I am in the proicess of redoing test VMs on server then I will check this.. might move or remove that print to stop further confusion

[25-Jan-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also there is no block reward
