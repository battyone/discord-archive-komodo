yes it would be useful to prevent nuisance spam attacks

[19-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
registering a million times to an oracle would slow down the dapp considerably I imagine

[19-Jan-19 03:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I recall early on dice contracts had no cash out. still the case?

[19-Jan-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
as in dealer cashout?

[19-Jan-19 03:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah

[19-Jan-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
just kill the dealer node and place high odds bets

[19-Jan-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
wait for it to time out, and you have emptied the contract

wandering if/how oracle owner cashes out

[19-Jan-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
cashes out?

optimal ping range viable?

[19-Jan-19 03:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
dont want to reward slow pings, else it's a race to the bottom.

[19-Jan-19 03:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
reward fast pings == colocated wins

[19-Jan-19 03:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what about s.d. around mean node network ping?

[19-Jan-19 03:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
should tend towards rewarding equidistant nodes

[19-Jan-19 04:20 AM] Alright#0419
it's a hard problem to solve, but not exactly time sensitive.

[19-Jan-19 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
No idea how it can be done. Joker himself seems to think it'll be extremely hard as well

[19-Jan-19 04:33 AM] CrisF#3405
`what about s.d. around mean node network ping?`
Not sure if this makes sense but would shifting to `very slightly above mean...` work?

[19-Jan-19 04:35 AM] CrisF#3405
(to increase network performance slowly over time, giving distant nodes a chance to keep up)

[19-Jan-19 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the available metrics are dubious, but ping seems the most salient. And are we really more interested in how far apart nodes are  than how long they take to communicate?

[19-Jan-19 04:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, in terms of ping.

[19-Jan-19 04:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
reward multiplier tiers could be tweaked based on the array of node pings (distribution normalised) in std. deviation ranges. Gives some wiggle room to be a little slower/faster

[19-Jan-19 04:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm happy to suggest complex statistical methods as long as someone else codes it :trollface:

should pingtime be not just between notaries, but the whole network?

[19-Jan-19 04:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is there a flag in `getpeerinfo` to indicate notaries?

[19-Jan-19 04:51 AM] CrisF#3405
If I'm remembering correctly he issue was to incentivize network performance while keeping it decentralized as realistically possible.  
Performance = whole
Decentralized = NN
Does that sound right?

[19-Jan-19 04:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah sounds right to me.

[19-Jan-19 04:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so its a tradeoff

[19-Jan-19 04:52 AM] CrisF#3405
I guess regular nodes have their own insentive to improve their own performance.

[19-Jan-19 04:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if mean of whole network, clusters would occur in high use areas

[19-Jan-19 04:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
i think that would incentivise NN to avoid being in the centre of those clusters

[19-Jan-19 04:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but it still causes geospatial gravity wells

[19-Jan-19 04:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Would that be out of anyone's control?  It might be easier to influence NNs?

[19-Jan-19 04:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if we're aiming towards a planar  time/space fabric, NN only would be much easier to achieve it

[19-Jan-19 05:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, that might be a easier first step to find/improve the security/performance balance.
Then move on to network as a whole?  Suppose that is just a performance goal.

@Mylo Are we assuming this is post-launch?

[19-Jan-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
If so,  need to PR the code to stakedchain/komodo on it's own branch, create the chain, look at what block 1 pays in coinbase, burn that amount on LABS main chain and PR the params to stakedchain/notary

[19-Jan-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
We'll iron out the exact process as we go. We have everything setup for it to work properly, but we will surely hit some snags during the first couple

if ccenable array is set then only the specified CC are enabled. the number is the number in cc/eval.h

[19-Jan-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
if ccenable is not specified, then the behavior is that all CC are enabled

i think this solves the issue of restricting which CC to enable on a chain,  of course, it is a hardforking change to enable a new CC

[19-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Alright#0419
just playing with assets atm, should be done with this soon

[19-Jan-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed a new update to jl777 branch that supports -ac_cclib=<name>
Jthis allows devs to make changes to a single file cclib.cpp and define a user defined CC that uses dynamic libraries so no need to even recompile komodod. this enables a separation of a user defined CC from komodod, yet is is part of komodod at runtime

For now, you need to go into src/cc dir and run ./makecclib to make the src/cclib.so file that will be searched for
the -ac_cclib=<name> must match the MYCCLIBNAME that is defined at the top of cclib.cpp
the name specified in -ac_cclib must match the name inside cclib.cpp
there is a CClib_Dispatch function that is called for evalcodes 0x10 to 0x7f (reserved for user defined CC)
what this means is that without rebuilding komodod, you can make a new CC that is inside cclib.cpp (and whatever files linked in to cclib.so) to do validation. For now, only the validation is added. for constructing CC tx, some external process will be needed which can be done however the custom CC wants it to
so for now, it is just a theoretical support for user defined CC, I guess we can make a pass through rpc that will invoke a custom CC rpc,but I leave that for someone else to do
ca333 is working on the build part, for now windows likely wont build at all

I just had another thaught, not sure how viable, but there could be a fungible chain that mines the bounty funds each month if not used mined supply auto burns, or infinitely time locks to a different address.

[20-Jan-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like a faucet but with a time limit.

[20-Jan-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem I see with just creating bounty funds from thin air, is not a problem with that itself, but the way outsiders may perceive this. I know thats not really relavent in what we are doing here... But any power to create coins willy nily should be totally avoided. Have a set amount put asside, if not used destroy them in some way that does not need any human intervention. MUltisig for notary nodes releases funds. 

Maybe the bounty mechanisim can be the first chain we test and make. ü§î

[20-Jan-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll drop back by here later today. See if anyone is around to discuss these things.  Likely need jl's input mor than anything else to work out a simple way to acheive this.

`require ~20,000-50,000 LABS to create`
Are we charging a ton or continuing on with the pattern of extremely high coin supplies?

[20-Jan-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe connect price to KMD as more stable?

[20-Jan-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Or even better USD

[20-Jan-19 08:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a X USD or KMD equivalent in LABS. If LABS price will be huge -  fee for chain creation might be too huge also. ü§î

[20-Jan-19 08:42 AM] TonyL#3577
But from other side possible to change it later

[20-Jan-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Labs inflation is quite low, but a lower supply to stake means that the chain may not work too well... I can adjust this if ppl think 20k is too much

[20-Jan-19 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just means that if a lof or supply ends up there the diff will need to adjust upwards a hell of a lot. Veeushash should keep pow pretty much right though, on test chain I got 7 billion difficulty with just 2 CPU cores and a 50k staker using 1 core on another node.

[20-Jan-19 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its 10 labs per minute forever inflation

[20-Jan-19 09:10 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
The verushash addition is kind of a double-edged sword in this case; adding ease of CPU PoW, but still leaving me nothing to do with this dam'd mountain of GPUs üòõ

[20-Jan-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes we would need to use veruahash version 1 to GPU mine... But that said these chains have no block reward... Main chain will stay equihash...

[20-Jan-19 09:13 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
The per chain reward of 0 is kinda offset by being a NN; so, it's not as bad as it sounds
But my mining is my issue, so I'll see where 2019 takes me

[20-Jan-19 09:14 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

How would @TonyL 's idea of pegging LABS to KMD or $ work?

[20-Jan-19 09:18 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
is `setgenerate true -1` no longer = $(nproc)?

[20-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea was just to have the cluster chains to be secure without requiring them all to have a minable block reward. By using VerusHash V2, its PCU only and there is no economic incentive for someone to make a GPU miner or FPGA miner for it... so keeping the chain moving is almost free (we could do what main net nodes do and make some notaries randmly mines a chain or 2) But having a PoS% means the chain has a cost... Otherwies there is an inflation of LABS coins, but no real buy demand.

[20-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it does do that... but might not actually work... I think you HAVE to specify the threads now.

[20-Jan-19 09:19 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
tried -1 and got a flood of `PoW diff violation`

[20-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on which chain?

[20-Jan-19 09:19 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
CFEKPOS51

[20-Jan-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... Maybe I broke it... I was testing that my verushash branch was still working with that chain, by restarting it periodically with the test branch... is possible I killed it entirly. PoW diff violation means that the difficulty is being generated diffrently in the miner than the validation, there was a few times I messed that up along the way.
