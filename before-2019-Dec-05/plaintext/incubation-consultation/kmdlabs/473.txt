`we need more iguanas`
Some folks can't operate 1, much less more than 2 :troll_lol:

_still isn't sure wtf he's doing with screen inside of tmux inside of xfceterm_

[23-Aug-19 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
Let the CFEKing begin

[23-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Alright#0419
what is the problem? @blackjok3r

[23-Aug-19 01:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
STAKED uguana lives!

[23-Aug-19 01:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
and all the CFEKMYLO chains

[23-Aug-19 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the terminal that comes with xfce desktop

[23-Aug-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I like xfce, it's light and has the main features I like

[23-Aug-19 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
linux desktops are very user-dependent on what's a "good recommendation
Coming from Win, I used to use desktop dir as a convenient storage space and it was the best one that allowed me to keep my old habits and allowed me to put toolbars/panels where I use them most

[23-Aug-19 01:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
Going to assume these assets also dont  pay the notaries?

[23-Aug-19 01:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
Did the stats count get updated like you mentioned @blackjok3r

[23-Aug-19 04:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Graph code updated. Not seeing any ntx on CFEKMYLO6 tho. Curves a bit misleading at the moment from older data and running the oraclewrite script to test, should even out over the next day or so

[23-Aug-19 04:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
bloody hell @blackjok3r  nice work on the colorised iguana TV

and the `screen` shortcuts - this is like going from sitting around the wireless to having HD cable with a remote.

[23-Aug-19 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`HD cable`? Wot's dat?

[23-Aug-19 07:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Aug-19 10:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ive concluded... Mylo #6 hates us lol

[23-Aug-19 10:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
is no one notarizing on that chain?

[23-Aug-19 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`matches.0 paxmatches.6 bestmatches.0 bestk.-1`
leads to: 'Not gunna do it'

[24-Aug-19 02:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
Not Iguana do it?????

[24-Aug-19 02:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[24-Aug-19 08:17 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Anybody else got Iguana going mental in the staked screen - chewing up 3 processors in mine.

[24-Aug-19 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not seeing that here 🤷🏽

[24-Aug-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No mine is ok too. Asnd MYLO6 seems to have started notarizing a while ago.

[24-Aug-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the staked branch has a known bug where it gets stuckin in ifninate loop selecting utxo, is fixed in new iguana.

[24-Aug-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have to  pkill -9 it and restart to fix it.

[24-Aug-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am also seeing node being banned and unbanned a fair bit here. 
4 nodes have somehoe submittind incorrect sig, and failing fastnotaries count. Might investigate this a little further, rather fix the cause of that bug happenign than needing to implement a ban on nodes. Because they are not doing it on purpouse, my node even had one.

[24-Aug-19 12:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I haven't been getting LABS notarizations for the last 2 days +.  (Only one after a total reboot)
Also dropped from amongst the top to the bottom the of stats, occasionally moving up to the middle for short periods, after an upgrade a few weeks ago.
I'm getting very frustrated after spending a lot of time on this with no results.
Any suggestions appreciated!

[24-Aug-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to move labs to the new iguana shortly I think.

[24-Aug-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems something is borken with it, maybe somehthing changed in daemon for utxo cache on KMD has messed it up not too sure. BUt the blackjok3r branch is working very well so i'll just change it over

[24-Aug-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to know if 8 peolpe are around though or it may stop. unless we notarize it with both iguanas at oncefor fa few days 🤔

[24-Aug-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is here for an hr or 3_

[24-Aug-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
screw it, i;ll chagnge my node over now and make sure its going to work, should be np, it just wont start the staked branch any more.

[24-Aug-19 12:40 PM] jorian#4555
i'm around

[24-Aug-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
a labs mention will probably get you 8?

[24-Aug-19 12:41 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I am here -

[24-Aug-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think, just doing start.sh enough times, it will addit to the blackjok3r iguana and leave the staked running, then once iit notarizes on blackjok3r we can kill the staked iguana. just waiting for my node to get past octet string build bug

[24-Aug-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, we're half way to enough

[24-Aug-19 12:42 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
need to fix something anyway - screen for iguana blackjok3r is missing

[24-Aug-19 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana blackjok3r.json 
still running?

[24-Aug-19 12:42 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
not answering curl

[24-Aug-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then its dead. you can update now if you like.. 
its just a PITA, because the last branch built is nSPV and master and utxo cache are oolder. So it fails to build a few times

[24-Aug-19 12:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Been moving network stuff this morning - so mostly rebuilt anyway. New pull just brought many_iguana

[24-Aug-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are updates in for komodo master and utxo cache I pushed yesterday, that fixes MoMoM, it was broken :abusedsmily:

[24-Aug-19 12:46 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I think that I built that  last night

[24-Aug-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm well.... my idiea to notarize with both isnt going to work, becasuse when it kills KMD to resratit it for master update teh staked iguana goes in infiante loop 😂

[24-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - now I can't get either iguana running

[24-Aug-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Aug-19 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181

still using screens?

[24-Aug-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it is, mighgt take it off for iguana tho hey?

[24-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Starting

[24-Aug-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the daemons I think its useful to screen them, incase you need to get stdout for debug... but you can ignore it most of the time.

[24-Aug-19 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is flexable_

[24-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
if we are single iguana - then running that to std out makes tmux simpler

[24-Aug-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. I will remove wscreen for iguana it.. just need to make sure the rest of the scripts still work.

[24-Aug-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did someone screen on the wrong screen?

[24-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
lost my focus

[24-Aug-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL I do that 10 times a day 😛

[24-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
lucky is wasn't my password - terrible for that

[24-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Rebuilt and single iguana running

[24-Aug-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
running and notarizing here

[24-Aug-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to work without screen just fine.. Its a total mess how its working now, but its working.. Will need to merge all these branches back to just one and fix it up later. Probably once these CFEKS are finished with.

[24-Aug-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because of the changes, it's not going to notarize LABS until enough people update, correct?

[24-Aug-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ummm you wil not notarize  LABS, unless you manually starte the staked iguana and connect to the non updatec nodes

[24-Aug-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
shoudl be able to run both at once really until there are enough in the new... but I couldnt make start.sh do that reliably

[24-Aug-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_lets the laggers have a few LABS_

[24-Aug-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that'll give me some time to work on my staker anyway

[24-Aug-19 01:20 PM] CMaurice#1685
nSPV2 didn't build

[24-Aug-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
juist keep doing start.sh

[24-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
repeat x3

[24-Aug-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it dfoes eventually work

[24-Aug-19 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just added a pane to tmux that lives at ~/komodo and the only thing up-arrow gets you is `zcutil/build.sh -j3`

{Reactions}
shexy 

[24-Aug-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I do that heaps... so many panes

[24-Aug-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
testing shit with RPCs lol... like 10 panes just press up for each one

[24-Aug-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`like 10 panes just press up for each one`
I've got 2 servers like that and one of them is local 🤣

[24-Aug-19 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my local has a retarded amount of panes, but most of them are for a single repeated command

[24-Aug-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my notary node was like that last year for ages,had about 20 windows

[24-Aug-19 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't used windows too much, even when I name them I forget which is which and I got tired of using ls

[24-Aug-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I useds them heaps, but yes, does get annoying with too many

[24-Aug-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS notarized

[24-Aug-19 01:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Did you manually start staked iguana?

[24-Aug-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Aug-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blackjok3r bramch has made 3-4 now

[24-Aug-19 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems mine has too

[24-Aug-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is almost ashamed to admit that his local LABS node is like 6 weeks behind on the chain_

[24-Aug-19 02:20 PM] jorian#4555
LABS notas are on fire
