so... CFEK?

[20-Jan-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe they need 2 chains not fungible for their contract...

[20-Jan-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It might not even get used

[20-Jan-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its there if we need it

[20-Jan-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And TBH .... I doubt many CC dApp chains, would want to use 100% PoW ... a hybrid or 100% PoS would ebt he only way to secure it properly.

[20-Jan-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
yes, not likely

[20-Jan-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
I need to test minimal amount that can be used to keep a chain moving

[20-Jan-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
also, do we have some way to keep it moving with just POW, so we're able to get all coins off of the chain

[20-Jan-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah VHT2 branch. Its just got V2 renamed to Version 1, but it works.

[20-Jan-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
or will we use bounty mechanism to recreate these coins?

[20-Jan-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can just throw 128 cores on it from AWS and it should voerpower the diff wall for a while.

[20-Jan-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
Your point about "creating coins" is also valid

[20-Jan-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would use the ounty mechanisim to pay back coins that get stug in case of accident

[20-Jan-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
so maybe the bounty is just part of founders then burned when not claimed

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
instead of creating chains to create these coin

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah thats what I was thinking... OR its own chain ..

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
Ah yes, that makes more sense

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
but can we do a multisig migrate?

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That burns coins created and not moved after some amount of blocks.

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
Oh guess we wouldn't need to

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes you should be able to I think...

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe you should try that.

[20-Jan-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
just pay it out on that chain then let people move it from there

[20-Jan-19 10:08 AM] Alright#0419
who will stake this chain?

[20-Jan-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it can be 100% PoW and notaries must mine it with 1 core...

[20-Jan-19 10:08 AM] Alright#0419
and if they don't?

[20-Jan-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well would all of them not?

[20-Jan-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Only 1 needs to be honest

[20-Jan-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mayeb 2

[20-Jan-19 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
resources to move a chain to end it can be done a number of ways
rentals like joker suggested or self-interested NNs with localized hash to dump it out

[20-Jan-19 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
would be tricky

[20-Jan-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ithink having some way of returning the coins, in case of this happenig is far easier.

[20-Jan-19 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
diff raises exponentially while POS% is under target

[20-Jan-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And if the chain was totally abbandoned... they cna simply be burnt

[20-Jan-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
might be possible to reorg over and over to retry it but dpow wouldn't allow it

[20-Jan-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If a claim is made we can work that out

[20-Jan-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I say maybe we launch with no bounty mechanisim and make this chain our first contract test... funded by ourself ( I can pay for it if need be, as my project for LABS to test, as I have quite a few STAKED4)

[20-Jan-19 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`diff raises exponentially while POS% is under target`
true enough, but it's not like you're looking at long term mining in this instance; a day or 2 at most, no?

[20-Jan-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This give us a test of the system... make sure it works

[20-Jan-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
VerusHash with just 2 modern cores cna get blocks when PoS is over 10%, they are just very slow. like 15mins or more.

[20-Jan-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
ok, launch without bounty mechanism at first then work on it sounds like a much better plan than talking about hypotheticals

[20-Jan-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so too.. We make main chain, 1/2 chains with 0BR (maybe one for DragonHound, and that one for Mylo ? ) then we flesh out this and make bounty chain/mechanisim as first project ?

[20-Jan-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
DragonHound is I guess just an Oracles chain...

[20-Jan-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for testing oracles

[20-Jan-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
if you think about it, the "cost" is the lost staking rewards of not having coins on the main chain

[20-Jan-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly

[20-Jan-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why it souldnt be too high... But it should be enough that the person who does it is motivated to use it

[20-Jan-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not just create chains for any idea they cna tink of...

[20-Jan-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then dissapear

[20-Jan-19 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
I think we can launch on Feb 1

[20-Jan-19 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
need to just set a date and try to hit it or we'll just be talking about it for another 6 months

[20-Jan-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Agreed... Main chain is ready to go... I cant see any remainign issues that willa effect it at all. Even fixxed issues in last months that we didnt even know existed.

[20-Jan-19 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
slow start on main chain maybe?

[20-Jan-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likey it will need to exist for a few weeks/months before there will be enogh supply to even make anything work.

[20-Jan-19 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
ac_eras makes this very easy

[20-Jan-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as that works with -ac_founders no worries

[20-Jan-19 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_is off to finish adding P2PK to his js lib_

[20-Jan-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All we need is ac_founders and ac_staked... Both of which sould not affect anything... Founders could be innaccurate if the block reward changes between payments... But paying each 24H the effect will be minimal.

[20-Jan-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
TODO
test minimum amount needed to keep chain going, figure out optimal params for 0BR chains
start a few of these, take stats, make sure expected block time is close to block time
test slow start
test -ac_founders_reward for notary payout chain

[20-Jan-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
can you think of anything else?

[20-Jan-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
I'll finish these over the next 2 days

[20-Jan-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That seems pretty much all of it.

[20-Jan-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
VHT2 branch *should* would fine for any testing.. If not please le me know if you find any issues ASAP and I will fix it right away.

[20-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
need to figure out signers and MofN for ac_script address

[20-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
will this be hard to change in the future?

[20-Jan-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was using a 2700X to test with, so if the CPU you use is much lower than that, it might have an affect... The chain takes about 300-400 blocks to calibrate the diff.

[20-Jan-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes chanign MofN means either buying a key off someone (really abd idea)... or hardforking the chain... or an airdrop to new chain (easierst option)

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
hardfork would be be best IMO

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
main chain should never die IMO

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No it should not...

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its limited MAX 15 signers BTW.

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
Oh

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@blackjok3r have you tested your vh2 stuff on any rig other than the beast that you have that was designed for that kind of stuff (like some weak rig that some newcomer might have) since not everyone has threadrippers and 9900ks?

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
we don't need ac_founders on main chain

[20-Jan-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No I havent... thats somethig we need to test I think...

[20-Jan-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was only usong a single core though.

游녨游낗 

[20-Jan-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
the mechanism for changing the ac_script address could just be changing the chain the coins come from

[20-Jan-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It cna be calibrated... It simply needs the MIN diff raised so that the MIN dif cant get 1s blocks.

[20-Jan-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
and not doing it on main chain

{Reactions}
游뱂 

[20-Jan-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So like hardfork the main chain to 0 BR .... and spin a new one wth diffrent params?

[20-Jan-19 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
no, reduce block reward on main chain so it doesn't included notary %

[20-Jan-19 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
move this notary % to a separate chain with ac_script

[20-Jan-19 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
no ac_founders ac_script on main chain

[20-Jan-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
unless you think it will be easy to change the ac_script address with notary change

[20-Jan-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ahh yeah I think that would be pretty easy.. 
if ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL  == LABS  && height > X 
return ... for founders function.

[20-Jan-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just wont pay out after some height.

[20-Jan-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Whatever % of supply was meant to pay to that becomes BR on a new chain

[20-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand

[20-Jan-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok so if the height is past... You just never pay the founders fee

[20-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
will we do ac_script ac_founders on main chain or move it to it's own so we can remove it from cluster when notaries change

[20-Jan-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That amount of coins is then the BR on anew chain... paid to who ever it needs to be paid to.

[20-Jan-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure the way its been coed allows a 0BR chain to have a commission...

[20-Jan-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
it doesn't need to be 0BR

[20-Jan-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would need to pay the entire BR to the multisig... noen to the miner.

[20-Jan-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
the full BR just needs to go to ac_script

[20-Jan-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if we hardcoded this in... May need its own branch... making it work with the LABS komodod might be tricky... sure it can be done though.

[20-Jan-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either way this is months down the track... as long as the 15 signers are choesn well enough and odnt do a runner ... it  should be ok.

[20-Jan-19 10:31 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
remind me, again, why it's still 'komodod'.....

[20-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becaue it works with all komodo AC and KMD still... it had to so notaries work

[20-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a-team sits behind my labs notary and notarie KMD for instance... its a normal KMD node.
