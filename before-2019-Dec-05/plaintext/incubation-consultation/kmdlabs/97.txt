plan is to let the CFEK testnet live on

[22-Nov-18 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
no reason it couldn't be used for other things

[22-Nov-18 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
question is what purpose will KMD notary testnet serve?

[22-Nov-18 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
if it's used to pentest things, it should mimic KMD notary network as close as possible, but if it's just use to test 3rd party coin integration it will work in it's current state

[22-Nov-18 09:35 AM] jorian#4555
mimic KMD notary network, to be able to test stuff without feking it up while on mainnet

[22-Nov-18 09:35 AM] jorian#4555
but i guess testnet is for girls

[22-Nov-18 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
it really depends on the "stuff" though

[22-Nov-18 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
you can use the TXSCL exception right now to test most things

I'm happy to push back as far as  0000hrs GMT if its a saturday.

[22-Nov-18 09:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no wage cuckery to interfere, and sleep is optional. also good to push time forwards to allow those living in the past to share our future.

[22-Nov-18 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
I don't expect 20 people to even notarize in the first day

[22-Nov-18 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
22 pubkeys in total, only going to be 2 lame ducks

[22-Nov-18 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
10 am sounds reasonable enough.

[22-Nov-18 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
If it's good in EU and AUS/Asia shouldn't be too bad.

[22-Nov-18 09:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
I'm getting ` [master] ABORTING!!! failed to update, Help Human! `

[22-Nov-18 09:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
which appears to  be update_komodo.sh

[22-Nov-18 09:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
which is strange because it's on master and up to date

[22-Nov-18 09:53 AM] CMaurice#1685
unless I've mucked something else up somewhere

[22-Nov-18 09:53 AM] CMaurice#1685
... and g'day

[22-Nov-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm I just pushed a fix there... maybe its not right... wiat a minute

[22-Nov-18 10:02 AM] CrisF#3405
I had that yesterday, too.

[22-Nov-18 10:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Re-try succeeded.

[22-Nov-18 10:07 AM] CMaurice#1685
I've been through more than 10 now, it's odd as I ran it yesterday, none of the changes I'm looking at there would've affected anything since then

[22-Nov-18 10:08 AM] CMaurice#1685
maybe I should rebuild from scratch

[22-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
seems build script is failing to fetch some dependencies lately

[22-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
need to work out why or host mirrors

[22-Nov-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the start.sh script is failing

[22-Nov-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
please manually build

[22-Nov-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and report the exact error

[22-Nov-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am trying to work out this problem, and need to not get distracted..

[22-Nov-18 11:23 AM] CMaurice#1685
apologies, all fine, with that

[22-Nov-18 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep cool... figured it would be spometing like that ... I appear to have the RPC returning a valid staked.json for ERA2 .. making ti work over multiple eras is diffuclt as hell... and requries another major refactor of the code.... I will fork a new branch and start on that, but this gets us to ERA2 at least for now.

[22-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CMaurice  fixed master error

[22-Nov-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have pushed a version to mastertest branch that uses an array of arrays of arrays for the "elected" staked notaries... this allows heaps of code to be simplified, and adding more erea's easier and faster.

[22-Nov-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Please dont update to it

[22-Nov-18 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
what did I miss?

[22-Nov-18 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's been challenging to keep up. I see that 10AM UTC tomorrow is the start of the "race" but what are the instructions? What repo do I need to setup ? I assume this repo: https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/

you want this...

[22-Nov-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
follow the instructions exactly

[22-Nov-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its very very easy

[22-Nov-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with a CLEAN VPS ... using something with things already installed on it ... will probably give headaches ... I had no end of issues using a used VM for mine.

[22-Nov-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That said, I am testing mastertest branch atm, and hopefully that is the one we will use... so it might be worth just waiting until I merge it down... getting late here, but I dont want too many more delays.

[22-Nov-18 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Finding some really strange things here...

[22-Nov-18 06:22 PM] jorian#4555

I think I found the reson ome people reported momom was not working

[22-Nov-18 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But I have no idea why its like that

[22-Nov-18 06:24 PM] jorian#4555
and not something you can fix?

[22-Nov-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can fix it ... but I need to figure out what it si first ..

[22-Nov-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are 2 notarisaion data bases

[22-Nov-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and they both need to line up exactly

[22-Nov-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
right now. one is accepting notarisations as valid, but the other one is not ... this happenend before

[22-Nov-18 06:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure why its regressed back like this... but I changed a LOT of code latly .. so its likely somehting I changed..

[22-Nov-18 06:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know what im doing more than before .. so I think i will make both DB just use the exact same code... they both do the same job a totally diffrent way... which seems error prone.

[22-Nov-18 07:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its ok ...

[22-Nov-18 07:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The staked.json and the array in komodod are diffrent

[22-Nov-18 07:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my changes here will fix that ... so human error cannot happen.

[23-Nov-18 12:17 AM] Mylo#8306
Lol 2 lame ducks ... out of 22 how many do the notarization.  4?   Could be days to get to 20!

[23-Nov-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can increase min sigs... At the moment basically nothing is working so until I fix it... Nothing can happen. I bailed and went to sleep as starting to male silly mistakes last night. Its definatly doing silly stuff, the dpow notarisations are valid, but the momom notarisations are not despite them using the same array of puvkeys and the exact same tx.

[23-Nov-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will confirm this is also the case on master to make sure its not something I have done, in merging in code from upstream komodo.

[23-Nov-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can't see how it can be though, as all this part of the code has been exactly the same for this entire testnet, all that changed was more people started notarising, which could be the problem also.

[23-Nov-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are pubkeys in staked.json that are not in komodod... Lucky I've already finished the RPC that builds staked.json inside komodod so this can no longer happen.

[23-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However, that does not explain why one function sees them as valid and the other not.

[23-Nov-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo  its 25 keys in the array, and min sigs is 5, so it should not take too long at all.

[23-Nov-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  please show up soon, we NEED to change era, I cant debug this issue with mismatched pubkey arrays in iguana/komodod. @metaphilibert  is some how in the iguana one, but not komodod, and its causing issues.

[23-Nov-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just tryng to get an RPC working to return a sendmany array to fund notaries, super easily... once thats done, I will merge mastertest to master and chagn ethe min protoclversion and we cna update... anyone who does not update will have their nodes cut off fromt he network.

[23-Nov-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cnt get inputs working... sendmany is shit ... just returns JSON with all notaries in curent era and 10 as the amoutn, better than nothing I guess.

[23-Nov-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can always change system clock to trick it to get a diffrent eras keys. Updateing StakedNotary repo now, to use komodods built in staked.json... and mering to master.

[23-Nov-18 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to be working.

https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/blob/master/src/notaries_staked.h#L51
Last change to verify your pubkey here. This list is the "master list" everything is now generated from this list automatically, stopping human error, as that has been a massive issue since the start. Also you can all update to latest master with a ./stop.sh git pull and ./start.sh
This will activate ERA2 in approximatly 2H.. You will need to either cron start.sh to run just after the era activation time stamp of: 1542964044 or simply restart manually any time after this time. It think manually doing it will be best just in case there are any issues. For those of you using a 4GB VPS, please make sure it has a swap file, as daemons crash (KMD in particular, without one). 
It really does not matter if we stop notarising, there was no warning for this update, normally there will be at least a week notice before era change. I am convinced all current issues are just from missmatched pubkeys, so we just need to transaition to ERA2, and then see what happens, if it all corrects itself we will be fine to launch the newest test chain as planned on saturday at 10am UTC. 

Alright, I will update 2 nodes on the new version, which will mine and stake, if you dont surface soon, the whole network will fork, as your miners will be on the wrong protocol verison. Again this isnt an issue, we just need this to happen ASAP... OR we are getting delayed another week. If it breaks totally... we just start new chains tomorrow.

Until I have the mining node up, it might complaing that it has no network peers... if that happens to you, just wait a while and start again.

[23-Nov-18 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I forked every chain... my chain is now the longest.. the latest master will not allow you to connect to nodes who didd not update.

[23-Nov-18 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely if your not updated soon, you wil lneed to resync the CFEK chains

[23-Nov-18 07:54 AM] CMaurice#1685
Oh, with new config.ini? Because that gives me error after git pull

[23-Nov-18 07:55 AM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r It's ok for me

[23-Nov-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do you have a notary up yet ?

[23-Nov-18 07:56 AM] CMaurice#1685
mine aborts with pubkey invalid

[23-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pubkey invalid, only tests that the pubkey is 66 char long nothing else

[23-Nov-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the ERA2 is not active for a few hours, so if you canged pubkey it might bebets to wait a few hours before updating ... if it not playing nivce just trun off the node for now

[23-Nov-18 08:10 AM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r You wrote to just "./stop.sh then git pull then ./start.sh" but if pubkeys are now in komodod only, we have to build it before ./start.sh, right?

[23-Nov-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it builds itself
