And I agree that Alright was also more questioning some process more than personally attacking SHossein. I think you will be a nice bunch to work it if I'm elected! Looking forward to it! üòÄ

yeah am a bit mad not to have the time to keep up and just make basic tweaks on testnet, wanted to join just by respect of other candidates but I m just being raped :p

@Deleted User  Someone is mining on your address or what^

[21-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
keeping minimal services everywhere just focusing on mainnet

I didn t even check, the only interaction I have  with the node is via another node launching scripts remotely

[21-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I use is as my testcase of remote deploying coins)

[21-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw this node will expire the 1st of may so I may just stop the testnet :(

[21-Apr-19 09:34 PM] kolo#1111
Do I see  @Alright raising same question again? Sorry, missed party this time

[21-Apr-19 09:43 PM] kolo#1111
I apologize to everyone who felt hurt by my decision to allow @SHossain and @Decker to work in their own regions unlike voters decided (who were far away from our internal kitchen and voted in random directions). I insist this decision gave network a lot of benefits and made 0 hurt. But that should not happen.

[21-Apr-19 09:45 PM] kolo#1111
I m still sure there are tons of edge cases (good examples are SH region and growing amount of abandoned nodes). All ideas for the future edge cases are warm welcome

[21-Apr-19 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Strob weird behaviour, it mined with XXX cores without any line argument

[21-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Decker#3767
@Alright probably you just forget one thing ... one year seems a long time ... @SHossain won 2 spots last year - AR and EU, and i won a EU spot. We just exchanged spots AR <-> EU, bcz it was comfortable for me to place hardware in AR, and for SHossain in EU. But you can count that decker_EU is equal to alien_AR and alien_AR is equal to decker_EU . Just @SHossain controls my decker_EU node which is named alien_AR and me controls alien_AR node which is called decker_EU. Now ... let's see the stats ... both nodes is in TOP of their regions. Mean, decker_EU win the spot and alien_AR win the spot ... doesn't matter who actually control each of them, me or @SHossain ... and `0dev4_decker` is just an `dev` node for 2019 ... So, AR region **owe** us a spot ) But i'm just agree with Kolo's decisions ... and i wish to see a "new blood" in a NN rows. That's why i didn't want to say anywhere that my node is auto re-elected, but it's true, and according to rules i have all rights on the spot in AR. Think about it )

[21-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Decker#3767
**p.s.** Also, i don't want to continue threads like this here ... simple bcz **we are community** and doing a common thing. Mean, we all trying to do our best for community, and in my opinion - threads like this with blaming somebody is unacceptable here. We should focus on other things ...

[21-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Decker#3767
*p.p.s.* Sadly to read things like this at my birthday ... ( I was absent here today, bcz celebrating with my family ...

`I apologize to everyone who felt hurt by my decision`
My position (and I believe the crux of the issue for others) is that if elections and regions are meant to promote decentralization, the decision should never be yours (or that of any one person or small group) to make.

Oh my god!!  I have only 6 not for the last 6 hours!!! Instead of just using cleanwallettransactions alone I just tried the stakednotary walletreset.sh script.... I have't sent to self since a while. We'll se what happens

[22-Apr-19 04:47 AM] Decker#3767
And good news. Seems we have testnet contest finished - https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455755767132454913/566956740906713088 .

I honestntly missed it was on and restarted to test something at the time it started it seems.

[22-Apr-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Better to go to new guys anwyay

[22-Apr-19 05:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I kept poking and testing stuff. Once I slipped out of the race, figure I may as well experiment and try and  learn something.

[22-Apr-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats the best thing to do... *testnet*

[22-Apr-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I may move my node back out of london, I think the group centralised there may be hurting eveyone else badly

[22-Apr-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also @Strob  make sure your on dev branh of jl777 repo because you dont seem to be notarizing TXSCLCC which is a MoMoM chain I am pretty sure.

[22-Apr-19 05:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, one thing I learned was that being in NA on a full spec server while most were in EU with low spec VPS  was a bad idea lol

[22-Apr-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. Im moving to somehwere in asia keeping low spec VPS today see what happens there

@blackjok3r  I installed like this:

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] Strob#3417
From the offical guide

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have you updated it since at all?

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] Strob#3417
no

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe try that

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] Strob#3417
ok

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as msot others have

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] Strob#3417
how do you know that?

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shoudlnt make any diffrence but it cant hurt. dev branch should NOT be rfeceving any merges for the rest of the testnet

[22-Apr-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there was discussion here a few days abck, as some ppl wer on my jl777 branch.

[22-Apr-19 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is in active development, and should not be being used on notary nodes, unless your testing some specific thing. like the wallet filter during blast day.

[22-Apr-19 06:09 AM] Strob#3417
Yes I saw the discussion but didn't realize everyone updated.

[22-Apr-19 06:09 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I also followed the official guide & build komodo on dev branch & haven't updated since last month

[22-Apr-19 06:10 AM] Strob#3417
But it seems running the wallet reset helped a bit I did 7 nots in the last 2 hours which is already a lot better than 6 not in 6 hours!

[22-Apr-19 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, a manual reset can sometimes be needed. the RPC with no txid is not a catch all solution without external utxo management

[22-Apr-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It doesnt appear to every break anything as such, but cna sometimes just not work if there is a utxo deep in the chain that hast not been spent.

[22-Apr-19 06:12 AM] Strob#3417
I used that walletreset.sh script from stakednotary so it does everything in order maybe that's what I needed!

[22-Apr-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, that sends to self, then waits for a confirm, then does the clean, removes all tx except the one where you consilidated all utxos

[22-Apr-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are other solutions out there also, that require daemon restarts, but they will actually reduce the wallet.dats phsyical size.

[22-Apr-19 06:13 AM] Strob#3417
Pretty neet script! The only part IM not sure what it does is when it uses rawtransactions. I will have to play with those

[22-Apr-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
learnign raw tx is a good idea yes. Will help a lot with manageing things like KMD mining rewards.

[22-Apr-19 06:14 AM] Strob#3417
Ok I guess to reduce the size of wallet.dat it must send to other address, delete, recreate and send back.

[22-Apr-19 06:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes pretty much. I merged a new param to `importprivkey` a few days ago, not sure if its in dev branch though. That takes a block height to rescan from. 
Using that the process becomes very simple... 
Send to self, wait a few confirms note block height it was confirmed at. 
Restart delete, import key with noted height. The only tx your wallet sees is now the one you just sent. üòÉ

üëè 

[22-Apr-19 06:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after that use cleanwallettransactions to keep wallet.dat at small size

[22-Apr-19 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in theory this will be the best approch.

[22-Apr-19 06:17 AM] Strob#3417
Ok cool!

[22-Apr-19 06:18 AM] Mylo#8306
@Strob that's how i do it.
send to paperwallet
stop daemon
rm wallet.dat
start daemon
import key
ssh with key to other box execute a send back to NN
all automated, 3 times per week.

[22-Apr-19 06:18 AM] Mylo#8306
it's not as efficient as blackjoker's method of digging into the wallet.dat file.

[22-Apr-19 06:19 AM] Mylo#8306
because of the 20minute downtime in restarting kmd each time.

[22-Apr-19 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My method is an evolution of that method, and many many thnings went wrong whiel I was making it.. really scrwed my node up at times... Lucky I had LABS to develop most of it. üòÉ

[22-Apr-19 06:20 AM] Mylo#8306
hehe..yeah i gotta pick what i can and cannot test üòÉ

[22-Apr-19 06:20 AM] Strob#3417
Yes I hope I can play in the labs to try stuff too one day!

[22-Apr-19 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really hope we get it going soon there are a lot of new CCs that need lots of testing.

[22-Apr-19 07:02 AM] Strob#3417
I added the walletreset to my crontab every 3 days. Guess where in which city I was today: https://imgur.com/kF72kdq
