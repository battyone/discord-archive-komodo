[05-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Strob#3417
but I wonder why cause I have 4ms to most big datacenters

[05-Apr-19 02:42 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

For those that think they might want to do way advanced prep:
```
#!/bin/bash
SHELL=/bin/sh PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
value=`cat $HOME/komodo/src/assetchains.json`
for name in $(jq -r '.[].ac_name' <<<${value}); 
    do
        String="https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/$name-bootstrap.tar.gz"
        eval "$String"
done```
because who's got time to do it manually?

it never liked my decimals, so I quit even trying 😛

[05-Apr-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That was probably my fault... I set the input for amounts as a integer... I think i fiuxed that by the way

[05-Apr-19 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one of these days I should clean up my scripts and post them

[05-Apr-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, staking efficiantly is an art... I think we have way further to go myself... the python script is a good base... I added heaps of RPC calls and extra outpouts to existing ones to allow more powerful staking.

[05-Apr-19 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine are all still bash 😛

🤔

[05-Apr-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I managed to do that when tracking -26 errors... You can write oupput to a file then have another bash script read the file every few seconds.

[05-Apr-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
technically you *can* pull it off with functions, but it eats too much ram and has 0 garbage collection that way

tl;dr; i'll make a summary.   the komodo election site is hosted out of github using jekyll SSG - some images will need your attention for links not to break.  I will make a summary.

Just a headsup, the election website lists the candidates now, it will _likely_ go out in today's five bullet friday in the next hour or two.  Reason is _likely_ is that it is on the shortlist of five bullet points, but it's not guaranteed.

However

@SHossain @PTYX @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @Deleted User @blackjok3r @FishyGuts @webworker01 @zatJUM 
& @Dr.Terminus 

Reason i'm mentioning you is https://komodoelection.com/candidates/
The page pulls the notary node proposals from github, and just renders them.   It will be an automated job in the coming week.

I've manually edited the above proposals on the website so the images work.   You all have similar (but different) ways to linking images, the best way is to link directly using either:
- https githubusercontent  domain
- imgur like chainmakers does
- other external source

Github in the readme contents pages and markdown, lets people do things in a variety of ways.  It's great for what it does, but for auto-generating content in another system, all your creative ways of making images load....need some kind of easy-to-massage method for marketing purposes (e..g website).

You have some cute cat pics and super geeky tech pics.   I'm sure the rest of the world would like to continue seeing them.   I'll make a summary of what will work without any problems, and what will give your candidate page an ugly missing link.

10pm here, time to spend with the missus.   Good night

but it was relative url, `./genie.jpg` which is great when it's in the repo, but sucks for generating externally

it doesn't render :emoji: correctly neither, so anyone using :emoji: should keep that in mind
