I know but it's always good to go to the source

What that bitcon core #2 dev says applies to the whole bitcoin network. But in the case of the small notary node network it may differ.

[05-Apr-19 03:50 AM] Strob#3417
Peers on the NN are not a scare ressource as every op can be a peer.

[05-Apr-19 03:52 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
That's not what he's saying.
If 8 people set 100 and connect to mostly the same peers that have 8 max, then those peers use up their open slots and can no longer propagate throughout the network

[05-Apr-19 03:53 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the more people you connect to that don't have extra opening is the more you close the loop

[05-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Strob#3417
Ok. So if4 NN op set 300 they will eat up other connections and srew up the others then?

[05-Apr-19 03:56 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes, because 1/2 of all opens of the 300 will be taken by just them

[05-Apr-19 03:57 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
(assuming 8 opens of ez math)

[05-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Strob#3417
In our case we have 16 outgoing by defaults.

[05-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Strob#3417
Anyway it would be good to know what everyone have done so far and see the effect on notarization. There's nothing like experimenting to really learn.

[05-Apr-19 04:19 AM] Strob#3417
The same Pieter Wuille also says this on a related question: 
```css
Connecting to more nodes will not make you learn about transactions faster, after some point.

Your node will just be busy processing messages - including many uninteresting ones - to maintain connections with all peers, making it slower at processing new things.

Connect to a few fast peers with -addnode, or even run multiple nodes yourself, and interconnect them to each other. That will be faster than connecting directly to everyone.
```

[05-Apr-19 04:20 AM] Strob#3417
So I think I will just leave my maxconnection setting as they are...

[05-Apr-19 04:20 AM] Strob#3417
So it doesn't speed us up but it may slow down the others!

[05-Apr-19 04:21 AM] Strob#3417
Which is surely not the goal of a good NN operator. üòâ

[05-Apr-19 04:28 AM] Strob#3417
Also:
```
what if i copy all nodes from blockchain.info/connected-nodes and do -addnode on my node, to force connect to all nodes ? ‚Äì AMB Jul 22 '17 at 5:25
You can't -addnode more than 8 peers. ‚Äì Pieter Wuille Jul 22 '17 at 5:57
```
So that's why there are only 8 of us at the beginning of the testnet.json ?

[05-Apr-19 05:06 AM] Alright#0419
@Strob the problem I see here is that it's possible for a NN to gain an advantage in notarization counts by actively harming the network

[05-Apr-19 05:07 AM] Alright#0419
so I'm trying to figure out just how harmful it would be if most of the notaries did it

[05-Apr-19 05:08 AM] Strob#3417
Yes, good idea.

[05-Apr-19 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
if the network completely implodes when we all do it, we'll have to police it somehow

[05-Apr-19 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
if it has no negative effect, it's not much of a problem and is at the discretion of the OP whether or not they want to try it

[05-Apr-19 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
if it shows a negative effect, I think we have to punish OPs that do it

[05-Apr-19 05:10 AM] Strob#3417
üëäüèª

[05-Apr-19 05:11 AM] Strob#3417
Maybe choose 4 or 5 testop and set them with 1000 connections while all others keep the default and see what happen

[05-Apr-19 05:12 AM] Alright#0419
that doesn't achieve much, we're already in that situation on both testnet and mainnet

[05-Apr-19 05:12 AM] Strob#3417
Ok!

[05-Apr-19 05:15 AM] Strob#3417
Who are the one with many more maxconnections? are they all at the top even if they did not start earlier?

[05-Apr-19 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
can't say for sure, but if I had to guess CHMEX and SHo. They may not be doing it intentionally though

[05-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Alright#0419
and I did ask people to do it, so it's not like they're doing anything bad

[05-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Strob#3417
CrisF too

[05-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Alright#0419
Ah right, yes

[05-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Alright#0419
don't think he did it until yesterday or the day before though

[05-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Strob#3417
So the top 4 at least!

[05-Apr-19 05:19 AM] Alright#0419
yea, starting to see the conundrum?

[05-Apr-19 05:25 AM] Strob#3417
On which line did you modify a sleep value in net.cpp? üòâ

[05-Apr-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
` MilliSleep(120000); // Retry every 2 minutes`
you only need to lower this until you have a good amount of peers

[05-Apr-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
then can change it back to default

[05-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Alright#0419
you actually don't need to change it at all, but it makes the difference between a week and a day

[05-Apr-19 05:28 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have a MAX  of 40 on the chains I did not change the MIlliSleep thing

[05-Apr-19 05:29 AM] Strob#3417
ok cool. I will try maxoutbound at 60 in net.cpp

[05-Apr-19 05:29 AM] Strob#3417
and maxconnection 125 in the .conf

[05-Apr-19 05:29 AM] Strob#3417
with timeout 8000

[05-Apr-19 05:30 AM] Strob#3417
and I already addnote the 8 peers for each asset since a while

[05-Apr-19 08:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
make a hole, coming through üòÅ

[05-Apr-19 08:12 AM] zatJUM#9924
Is someone using "basic" iptables rules for his node?

[05-Apr-19 08:12 AM] mrlynch#5735
i use ufw.. it's easier to manage

[05-Apr-19 08:14 AM] zatJUM#9924
I think I'll have to learn that because I really don't manage to setup correctly my iptables rules and always block what I dont want to block! üòâ

[05-Apr-19 08:14 AM] zatJUM#9924
And everybody seems to use ufw

[05-Apr-19 08:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
ufw is just a wrapper for iptables

[05-Apr-19 08:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
but it has easier commands

[05-Apr-19 08:19 AM] zatJUM#9924
Yes I know that, that's why I wanted to learn the rules directly, not the wrapper, but it will be easier et quicker to learn ufw (no extra time lost!)

[05-Apr-19 08:25 AM] jeezy#3408
has the official list of automatic reelected been released btw?

[05-Apr-19 08:34 AM] CHMEX#0686

```StrobToday at 2:18 PM
CrisF too```  Hi, yeah, I changed it but adjusted the wrong time ü§¶ 
Am in the process of restarting with setting `777` and `40000`.  Will give that some time and see what happens.

[05-Apr-19 09:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Thinking about changing my node on Sunday or more likely next week.  Depends on what else I find to experiment with still on this one.

[05-Apr-19 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
@Strob Thanks for the further info ‚òù üòé

[05-Apr-19 09:08 AM] NNoperator#3835
@Alright  If we are officially trying to run an experiment, in the testnet, and get meaningful answers.  It may be helpful to get a handle on the variables.  Do we have an idea of what operators, besides CrisF and you are doing?  I will be default for now.   You said : ```they do it every 2 minutes by default
I think I have it set to 30 seconds atm```

[05-Apr-19 09:08 AM] NNoperator#3835
Cris is 40 ?,  anyone else?

[05-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
confirmed, crisf, mrlynch, CHMEX to some extent

[05-Apr-19 09:09 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ ? I believe?

[05-Apr-19 09:09 AM] NNoperator#3835
Hopefully there will be a few more brave souls running default ?

[05-Apr-19 09:09 AM] Alright#0419
why?

[05-Apr-19 09:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I don't, with MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS = 100 I already have a good amount of peers

[05-Apr-19 09:10 AM] NNoperator#3835
That's how experiments generally work, right?

[05-Apr-19 09:10 AM] NNoperator#3835
you need a null hypothesis?

[05-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
we want to see as many people do it as possible

[05-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
then check if we can still bootstrap BEER PIZZA and TXSCLCC without problems

[05-Apr-19 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
We know what happens when a handful do it; their counts go up.

[05-Apr-19 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
We don't know what will happen if many people attempt it

[05-Apr-19 09:11 AM] NNoperator#3835
I am more worried, about peers being locked out of notarization cycles

[05-Apr-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If everyone has open ports all that should happen is that the network will waste a LOT of bandwidth

[05-Apr-19 09:12 AM] NNoperator#3835
define bootstrap?

[05-Apr-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
just sync fresh from scratch

[05-Apr-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
find a reasonable amount of peers by just running the komodod line on a fresh node

[05-Apr-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and yes, a side effect may be that syncing will slow down, as all nodes will be wasting bandwidth pinging blocks around to each other wastefully.

[05-Apr-19 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
@PHBA2061 you're using `MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS = 100`?

[05-Apr-19 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
it becomes a matter of... Do we tolerate it? Do we simply discourage it? Do we actively police it?

[05-Apr-19 09:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
just a question how would you police it?

[05-Apr-19 09:20 AM] PHBA2061#2530
idk, I changed the parameter to see if it makes is any difference

[05-Apr-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If everyone is doing it, then there will be no advantage to doing it üòâ

[05-Apr-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh I think speeding up the iguana loops is far more effective than trying to get the blocks faster

Has anyone bothered to register a domain name for their notary nodes ? I know its more an aesthetic thing really.

[05-Apr-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the trick is to enter a dpow round first. That means, select utxos as fast as possible and monitor the block height of all the chains as fast as possible.

[05-Apr-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think everyone forcing maximum connecttions is safe or a good idea at all... But as it does seems to increase counts people are going to do it.

[05-Apr-19 09:23 AM] CrisF#3405
@newvulcan  I have.

[05-Apr-19 09:29 AM] newvulcan#4719

I'm preparing a bootstrap for it but sounds like even unpacking would be longer

[05-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
first half of BTC in 30 minutes on 10Gbit is not unreasonable

[05-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
especially if there are peers in the same DC

[05-Apr-19 09:34 AM] newvulcan#4719
I have 40GB used so far but I have komodo downloading as well

[05-Apr-19 09:34 AM] PHBA2061#2530
the other half may take a bit longer though

nice,  that is fast...  You can check on actual blockchain progress, just see how close you are to 241008830000 in your bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
