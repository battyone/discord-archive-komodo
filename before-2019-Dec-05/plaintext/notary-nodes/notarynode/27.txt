seems I can't sync pirate here

[24-Sep-18 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
already tried 3 full resync ><

trying to rererererererresync with another node IP üòÑ

[24-Sep-18 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, now that PIRATE is notarizing, we need one more NN to get Hush working to make a notarization! we are at 12 nodes üòÉ

[24-Sep-18 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
PIRATE beat Hush to notarizations in prod, impressive

[24-Sep-18 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 i am running supernet dev which includes Hush stuff as well as utxo locking

[24-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause it s an AC üòÑ

[24-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
do you see me on SET @dukeleto  ?

[24-Sep-18 04:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think maybe that is why many NNs haven't updated

[24-Sep-18 04:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
utxo locking changes some stuff

[24-Sep-18 04:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
but if it works (and it seems to for me), James will merge it soon üòÉ

[24-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
on my side the only risk is ending with more utxos than I expect, as listunspent doesn t take into account the amount of listlockunspent, but not a problem

[24-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw about sending on PIRATE... It seems my method worked : http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/aee3d4006672927ddab48044ce732ac1057f342e233aa20306f68aaa3f46e7ce

[24-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
don t know what you used @SHossain

[24-Sep-18 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
that looks like a z->t transaction to a notary address, right?

[24-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
via CLI

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
not supposed to work ^^

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have done t->z for PIRATE via CLI

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
theorically z_sendmany returns an error

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think only notaries can receive taddr funds

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can test it right now

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
and coinbase must be transparent

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
everything else must be shielded

[24-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
give me a random KMD address ^^

RBSEv7nJ1wciriVyLFWotQ8tBvS2rKwYtz

[24-Sep-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is not a notary addr

[24-Sep-18 04:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User i used `sendtoaddress` from my NN to other NN

[24-Sep-18 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
pirate has been moving fast, some stuff changed since I last looked a few weeks ago

[24-Sep-18 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
but I think taddr vouts are allowed if addr is a notary addr now

[24-Sep-18 04:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s not a notary @dukeleto  ?

[24-Sep-18 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
but it should not allow t->t to a notary

[24-Sep-18 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
you said "random address" üòÉ

[24-Sep-18 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
"message": "16: bad-txns-acprivacy-chain"

[24-Sep-18 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
probably a good idea to only allow coinbase to taddr and only allow z->t to a notary addr

[24-Sep-18 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, seems normal

[24-Sep-18 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
so it worked from Z to T cause am recognized as notary

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the rule is

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
taddress to notary address is allowed

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
that's it

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
(had to remove stuff from rpcwallet.cpp)

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing about full moons

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing about vins

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c you could only allow z->t to notaries if you want, to be more shielded

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, my tx was random z address to t address

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
then the relations between NNs to NNs are not on blockchain

[24-Sep-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
(notary one)

[24-Sep-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
what relations of NN to NN?

[24-Sep-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
all NN are known

[24-Sep-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
notarizations are a stochastic process

[24-Sep-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
all we get is notaries being able to do taddrs to allow notarization

[24-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, but Z->T even if destination is notary isn t supposed not to be possible ?

[24-Sep-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
they could also do whatever sort of inter notary commerce

[24-Sep-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
I said the blockchain enforces the new rules

[24-Sep-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
rpc is using stricter rules, other than FSM sendtoaddress, which i made match

[24-Sep-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
you can look at FSM branch sendtoaddress to see how the other calls should be fixed

Hi, can anyone verify when was the last EQL notarization on their node?

[24-Sep-18 05:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think the issue might be because of someone mined it and then stopped.

[24-Sep-18 05:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
`  "difficulty": 1078.569165944476,`

[24-Sep-18 05:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
dificulty seems a bit high on my node

[24-Sep-18 05:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
my notary node has been on `  "blocks": 141730,  "longestchain": 141730,`for quite some time.

[24-Sep-18 05:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for EQL?

[24-Sep-18 05:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like they have someone "attacking" the chain

[24-Sep-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
they would need to keep a miner on it

[24-Sep-18 05:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i already mentioned to them to start a miner

Its the PoS percentage prints... I think its prety well enoughj tested they can be removed now @jl777c ? They are kind of annoying.

[25-Sep-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is removed in FSM branch, will propagate next time I push to jl777 and dev

my gamecredits node broke

[25-Sep-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
by that do you mean the notarizations DB dissapeared and you needed to reync it? has ahppened to be once or twice, but I thaught it was because of disk issues.

[25-Sep-18 02:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
something like that

[25-Sep-18 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[25-Sep-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181

is there a place where I can find all older versions of agama ? @Smk-High lost funds on older version using QR code to unlock agama, he reports that unlocking today with QR results in unlocking a totally different address. I'd like to test multiple versions of agama and generated QR.

[25-Sep-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
he was on 0.2.4.1, but the github seems to have moved from supernet to komodoplatform
