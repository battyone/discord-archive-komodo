i need to do something to catch up with you :troll_rage:

[11-Apr-19 10:34 PM] Strob#3417
Slowed down a bit by my server swap.  After I redirected the ports to the new server it seems I had ta restart Iguana.
I changed my cable from cat 6 to cat 7, my new server spec is: i9-7980XE-DDR4 64GB ram-Intel Optane SSD 905P Series (960GB) we'll see what such a hard rive can do. Supposed to be faster for many small files transfer.

@mrlynch , You were catching up yesterday.  Very interested to see the effects ofthe 10gbps.

me too

[11-Apr-19 10:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
but it's not just the line.. the hardware is slightly newer as well

[11-Apr-19 10:41 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm thinking about changing to another server, ran out of time this week.  Will see if I can find 10gbps.

@Decker i'll have both for mainnet if we win 😄

[11-Apr-19 10:43 PM] SHossain#0007
you will not belive if you know that Decker uses 100mbps

[11-Apr-19 10:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
some say the new AMD cpu's are the shit

[11-Apr-19 10:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
i would believe because i'm sure the software is tweaked harder than a tweaker looking for a tweaking fix 😜

```whatever_script=$(~/nnutils/whatever_script.sh | tee -a ~/logs/whatever_script.log 2>&1) && ~/nnutils/telegram/telegram_send.sh "[Whatever Script Report]\%0A ${whatever_script}"```
to get some fancy reports

Btw ... i saw some proposals with hardware specs like `64 Gb RAM` ... just for knowledge, that currently average RAM usage on NN is near 47 Gb ... and 64 Gb probably good only for "first time", better to have 128 Gb setup.

[11-Apr-19 11:08 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

KMD and src/assetchains comes to 28G, @Decker what's the other 19?

[11-Apr-19 11:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
RAM , not HD space 😛

`45.8086MB           /home/lynch/2019NNtestnet/agents/iguana testnet`
i'm assuming it's going to be a lot more for mainnet

[11-Apr-19 11:13 PM] SHossain#0007
testnet doesn't use much RAM

[11-Apr-19 11:13 PM] Decker#3767
Iguana 5-7 Gb RAM for mainnet.

[11-Apr-19 11:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
i have reserved 96 gb to start with 😁 edit: 96 sorrz, can go up to 192

FWIW - The third node Pirate is applying for is more of a backup/safety net in case there is a high possibility to provide added strength to a region. 

We will be judicious I’m pressing community for votes on that.

i just love the idea that maybe we ll have 2 separate iguana networks allowing us to balance and optim even better

[12-Apr-19 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe it s not for tomorrow, I mean for the upcoming change

[12-Apr-19 12:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at some point, due to hosting options, I can see where that's possible

not due to hosting

[12-Apr-19 12:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
pure sec purpose

[12-Apr-19 12:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
it also alignates with hw optim. NN being forced to get txindex=1 we have a huge btc chain and a not so big for any AC. moving external coins to another server could spare a 64gb for kmd and future AC and another server with same specs would handle kmd and external coins

[12-Apr-19 12:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
more room for dpowed external coins

[12-Apr-19 12:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
more room for ac

[12-Apr-19 12:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
and same server costs globally

[12-Apr-19 12:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
the modularity of it is  not obvious as it would require to code this during a big update, so it have to be planned

[12-Apr-19 12:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
and maybe it s not yet possible, but I would really love to explore the **s** of pubkeys

[12-Apr-19 12:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
seeing this as some sort of dual layer service : embedded for assetchains and on external pub for external chains

[12-Apr-19 12:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
the only financial incentive to be a NN is the easymining so keeping that priv for kmd and ac and allocating another one(s) for external coins would really be huge

[12-Apr-19 12:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think @Alright mentionned the 1 derived pub per coin
