Vote for me !

[14-Apr-19 09:26 PM] Decker#3767
Easy way to control your VOTEs without using any explorers or
websites is to use `importaddress` with needed addresses in
Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean). Then, you can see balance of any
watch-only addresses on Receiving addresses Tab.

speaking of VOTE2019  I get HTTP error when I try to bring up VOTE.  Anyone see this?

[14-Apr-19 09:31 PM] Decker#3767
HTTP error when it tried to open RPC listen port?

[14-Apr-19 09:33 PM] SHossain#0007
you can also login into Agama Lite mode using the VOTE2019 address and can see the balance and txs

I think I need to open a port for it

show `netstat -peanut | grep 45888` ...

[14-Apr-19 09:34 PM] Decker#3767
or just change rpc port in your VOTE2019.conf ...

@NNoperator probably you should kill pid 23846 before launch VOTE2019 ...

thank you!  It worked like a charm @Decker .

@Dr.Terminus are you trying to set up a mainnet NN?

[14-Apr-19 10:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
testnet

[14-Apr-19 10:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
isn't testnet all I need for voting month ?

[14-Apr-19 10:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[14-Apr-19 10:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't need btc for testnet

[14-Apr-19 10:37 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

made it pretty much to the end before hitting issue.. do I basically need to start all over following guide you've linked instead ?

[14-Apr-19 10:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, that's for mainnet

[14-Apr-19 10:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
damn.. none any use? clean slate time ?

[14-Apr-19 10:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the way they build and start are different

[14-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this is the full testnet setup guide? setup fresh ubuntu 16.04 then follow just the instructions on that link? I feel like I'm missing something

[14-Apr-19 11:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I install komodo right after install of dependencies?

[14-Apr-19 11:05 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[14-Apr-19 11:05 PM] phm87#7395
you can use a bootstrap to sync kmd, beer and pizza to get synced more quickly

get ubuntu x64 16.04 set up from scratch.. I followed wrong guide..

[14-Apr-19 11:06 PM] phm87#7395
if you already synced kmd, you can simply stop all the other assetchains you are running and stop btc

[14-Apr-19 11:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thought they sort of crossed paths

[14-Apr-19 11:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

iguana that we are using for testnet is into Alright repo

[14-Apr-19 11:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't need to ditch the vm, just start with/in the correct repo and follow those instructions

[14-Apr-19 11:08 PM] phm87#7395
Genie is right : keep the parts that you already have (kmd at least)

[14-Apr-19 11:08 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I did fork the right repo

[14-Apr-19 11:09 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
when i got to 'Setting up SuperNET/Iguana'

[14-Apr-19 11:09 PM] phm87#7395
ok you must follow these instructions, you can use a bootstrap when you will sync BEER and PIZZA

[14-Apr-19 11:09 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I forked the Alright repo in place of what guide had listed

[14-Apr-19 11:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
2019NNtestnet is my current working directory

[14-Apr-19 11:10 PM] phm87#7395
mmmhhhh for testnet it is easier, please just follow the few steps of Alright repo and do not use your guide

in your guide, I see many steps that I didn't do

[14-Apr-19 11:11 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok.. I'm new to github..  do I need to do more than simply delete the directory i forked from this vm ?

[14-Apr-19 11:12 PM] phm87#7395
yes delete the folder where you downloaded iguana of superNET

[14-Apr-19 11:13 PM] phm87#7395
and follow Alright explanations it will be way more easier

[14-Apr-19 11:13 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the whole 2019NNtestnet folder then.. ok. deleting and forking anew

[14-Apr-19 11:14 PM] phm87#7395
then if you follow Alright readme for testnet of NN 2019, you'll create a PR similar to this one:

it's just the difference of test notary vs main notary

yes

[14-Apr-19 11:25 PM] phm87#7395
yes but to fork the repo and do the PR you'll need your pubkey but yes you can fork it now

[14-Apr-19 11:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok.. not the pubkey from my local wallet used for peopl to cast vote to

[14-Apr-19 11:26 PM] phm87#7395
no we generate new address and pubkey for testnet, it is better

[14-Apr-19 11:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
read that step earlier and wondered if / when at any point in setup guide I actually needed to provide the NN kmd vote address I provided

[14-Apr-19 11:27 PM] kolo#1111
@Notary-Operator announce for VOTE2019 and HUSH3 notarizing is in the announce channel.

Also one important addition to the elections. When choosing to operate in SH region - think well of what you will do. SH proven to be very problematic in terms of connection to outter world - you may end up with problems notarizing or mining blocks. This year choosing SH and consequence is strictly on you, no exceptions.

[14-Apr-19 11:27 PM] phm87#7395
I used another KMD address for the testnet @Dr.Terminus

[14-Apr-19 11:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
gotcha

[14-Apr-19 11:28 PM] kolo#1111
In shorter words - latency in SH will kill you maybe.

My testnet node is in SH, it hurts but it is still notarising

[14-Apr-19 11:33 PM] phm87#7395
@Dr.Terminus  when you have your pubkey you can launch assetchains, replace $pubkey by your pubkey
```./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=BEER -ac_supply=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146 &
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=PIZZA -ac_supply=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146 &
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=TXSCLCC -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &```
