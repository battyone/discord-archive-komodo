the gremlins already took a mandatory sacrifice of my chickens yesterday

after restarting iguana yesterday, my node's performance improves a lot, may be it's just a coincidence

[20-Apr-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it bogs down after sometime... Ive been trying to fix this for weeks now... but as it takes 8 days or so to getinto the state its very difficult tto test.

[20-Apr-19 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Got a fair idea of whats happening, but no idea how to fix it.

[20-Apr-19 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[20-Apr-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, I was only 1/2 joking, I did restart everything yesterday, cleaned caches and logs too 😖

👋 (5) 😛 🤗 

[20-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
is there to manually increase connections to AC's with notably fewer connections than others ?

[20-Apr-19 02:38 PM] CrisF#3405
There's `addnode`

[20-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
is there an updated list of all nodes for each AC ?

[20-Apr-19 02:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thought they only needed to be added once, then in future chain initializations they didnt need to be added again..

[20-Apr-19 02:39 PM] CrisF#3405
I had low connection counts at the start and used the `net.cpp` hack Alright posted.

[20-Apr-19 02:40 PM] CrisF#3405
I believe you need to re-add after daemon restart.

[20-Apr-19 02:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Can also add them to the `.conf` or start params I think.

[20-Apr-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`thought they only needed to be added once, then in future chain initializations they didnt need to be added again..
`
correct, that's the point of peers.dat file

{Reactions}
🙏 

[20-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
even if i restart whole server ?

[20-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
every node I've added remains in peers.dat ?

[20-Apr-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, it's a database

[20-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I see.. gotta dig into that

[20-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
does it filter out duplicate entries ?

[20-Apr-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's supposed to 😛

[20-Apr-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it does not, however, filter out dead nodes

{Reactions}
☠ 

[20-Apr-19 02:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
simple ping to determine if they are live? or is there up to date list of live ones for each chain?

[20-Apr-19 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's designed to try known nodes in a cycle

[20-Apr-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dump slow ones and keep fast ones

[20-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so once i've added nodes, which I have, several times, prob a lot of dead / slow ones in there too

[20-Apr-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
set it and forget it

[20-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so now starting chains should look like ./komodod -pubkey=03f2f6816ef5e9e956f38d55ebb6464ea972a152790ce677198b11f0962a3b2cfe &

[20-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
./komodod -pubkey=03f2f6816ef5e9e956f38d55ebb6464ea972a152790ce677198b11f0962a3b2cfe -ac_name=BEER -ac_supply=100000000

[20-Apr-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for KMD, yes

[20-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no need to -addnode again

[20-Apr-19 02:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
for any chains ?

[20-Apr-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
correct, once is all you need to do it unless you delete peers.dat

[20-Apr-19 02:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
🤔 ok..

[20-Apr-19 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why if you look in debug.log you'll see like:
```2019-04-20 14:46:12 connect() to 173.244.36.36:7770 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)
2019-04-20 14:46:12 connect() to 173.244.44.81:7770 failed after select(): Connection refused (111) 
2019-04-20 14:46:25 connect() to 145.239.232.32:7770 failed after select(): Connection refused(111)```

[20-Apr-19 02:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I see.. and is there a command / technique to help me discern fast from slow servers ?

[20-Apr-19 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, it's built in

[20-Apr-19 02:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ooooh ok,

[20-Apr-19 02:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
next stupid question. Do I need to be doing fresh git clones of 2019notary and/or stakednotary repos regularly?

[20-Apr-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only update stakednotary if you chcek repo 1st and know you want something labs is working on
testnet repo the updates are announced here if you need to do something or auto otherwise

[20-Apr-19 02:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

@blackjok3r 
```
blackjok3rToday at 1:34 PM
none. It was caused by using 2 daemon at ocne with the same key imported as far as we could wrok out.
unless this "bug" is reported again, I wont be looking at it further.
```
nope

[20-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
as I explained about 15x, it was not imported to multiple daemons

[20-Apr-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie said it was

[20-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
I said it wasn't

[20-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
the one reporting the bug

[20-Apr-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
From what I see, @SHossain is likely experiencing the same thing on his BEER node

[20-Apr-19 04:44 PM] jeezy#3408
@jl777c  which bitcoind version do you recommend  for new NN currently?

[20-Apr-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
because he'll notarize the other two chains fine then his BEER node keeps not notarizing for a few hours

[20-Apr-19 04:45 PM] Alright#0419
same thing that was happening to me

[20-Apr-19 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is nothing wrong with mine, what exact commit ar you on? I wil change to that

[20-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
I'd need to dwy attack myself to reproduce it I think

[20-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
once I cleared dust from another node, all is well

[20-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
hasn't happened since which is very strange

[20-Apr-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Genie said it was`
We have another genie? cuz it wasn't me

[20-Apr-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I said that's the only time __I__ had it

[20-Apr-19 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats also what I said

[20-Apr-19 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"genie said it wasnt"

[20-Apr-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
to be clear before you say the second node caused it....

[20-Apr-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
genie said a second node did it to him

[20-Apr-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
clear

[20-Apr-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
It was broken for a week before the second node even existed

[20-Apr-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
I *fixed* it with the second node

[20-Apr-19 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
When __I__ experienced it, it was because __my__ 2nd node spent the UTXO the NN was trying to spend
I have no knowledge of what/why/when anyone else had it 😛

[20-Apr-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... thats what I said... I cant reproduice this, how to fix? Need wallet in sthat state I think even then, likely woundt be easy

[20-Apr-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
from the description its related to importing priv key without rescan

[20-Apr-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which is like standard BTC code stuff...

[20-Apr-19 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my node and others that used wallet filter in blast... had np

[20-Apr-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter

[20-Apr-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
although I'm curious if SHo is experiencing it

[20-Apr-19 04:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he said he didnt 🤷

[20-Apr-19 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
how does iguana get momom data? I need to see if daemon is giving 0s or iguana is getting real data then 0ing it

[20-Apr-19 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
Why does only his BEER node keep going down I wonder

[20-Apr-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
