[01-Apr-19 08:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
7

[01-Apr-19 08:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
or 8

[01-Apr-19 08:51 PM] VoskCoin#1869

[01-Apr-19 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was told 8 for NA, not sure of the rest

[01-Apr-19 08:52 PM] mrlynch#5735

last year only 5 for NA were up for grabs 😮

```At the end of the voting period, the 8 addresses in each region with the most VOTE tokens will be awarded a seat as a Notary Node Operator.
```
i believe this settles it

I'm going to literally cry if I don't get in, because I had 90% chance of getting it last year and opted not to run 😭

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Strob#3417
I have zero chance of getting in this year and I opted to run anyway so at least I will learn something! :pirate:

[01-Apr-19 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You never know, the landscape of who holds what has changed quite a bit since last year

[01-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Strob#3417
I just hope I have a secret fan who hold a lot somewhere! 😉

[01-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

it'll be dropped and confirmed just before the params are released, I imagine

[01-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I wanted to run for NA node, decided to back out there

[01-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[01-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[01-Apr-19 09:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but now seeing competing applicants and the payouts they are willing to give to voters.. I'm not even 100% on how to orchestrate payouts and don't want any hang ups / tax bs either I'm not aware of bing pertinent

[01-Apr-19 09:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[01-Apr-19 09:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I could, and I def support KMD..

[01-Apr-19 09:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this is little blurb I had prepared..

[01-Apr-19 09:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
"I am an experienced and self sufficient systems / networking admin as well as an effective project planner and service responder. Graduated college over 12 years ago now and I've been operating as an independent contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in selling, planning, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, servicing and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems. I've never had a boss, just a handful of regular trusting and happy clients.

I'm very happy to make myself part of the KMD community efforts by assisting newcomers where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience. I joined this KMD discord channel within the first day it came online and can be counted on to remain present and involved here throughout NN upkeep. I'm ready and willing to work hard to keep a single node up and running at it's best. I'm a true KMD believer. Currently holding as much as I can afford to but will need help from community to get enough votes to earn a node."

[01-Apr-19 09:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
thank you @Dr.Terminus

I submitted my PR and then remembered I didn't add any promises 🤷🏽

[01-Apr-19 09:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
me neither, kolo moved proposals to obsolete and i assumed that they;re off the table on git

[01-Apr-19 09:21 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I may have to do it without promise of any sharing of monthly NN reward

[01-Apr-19 09:21 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if i am needed I want to help.. already paid ~ $300 to hosting compny i have converted to funds on standby

[01-Apr-19 09:21 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

I worry about financial / legal / tax obligation which could stem from 'sharing' / 'paying out' vs 'gifting' .. dont need that fuss

[01-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
revshares ?

[01-Apr-19 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I would advise all the other whales the same standard

`kolo moved proposals to obsolete`
those were the old ones from last year

You guys will be only possible people to vote for me. Nobody in real life knows I crypto.. I dont social media.. I truly want to help, but is it plausible that I can win a NN just with experience / attitude i've expressed above?

[01-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok.. that means a lot

[01-Apr-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
real life people have how much KMD to vote with?

[01-Apr-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
only KMD matters for NN elections

[01-Apr-19 09:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
agreed with SHossain, that's the  very first thing you have to promise

[01-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
right on..

[01-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
well I got my github account created and can hopefully put something together quick enough to still be eligible.. am I too late ?

[01-Apr-19 09:25 PM] SHossain#0007
and, don't leave your node when you see you will not be auto re-elected for the next season. you are elected for one season and must keep notarizing until the end.

`don't leave your node when you see you will not be auto re-elected `
who would do that? even if you're pissy about it, why would you give up income?

[01-Apr-19 09:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I do not have server / environment up and running yet.. Likely need to create new KMD address rather than personal Ledger Nano S one as well. Placeholder will be quite baron to start

[01-Apr-19 09:28 PM] SHossain#0007
NN is very imporatant for the whole Komodo ecosystem. You should be commited at that level.

_is committed enough that he's not mined outside the ecosystem in over a year (even though it would have been more profit to secure other chains and buy KMD with the profits)_

[01-Apr-19 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
another imporatnt thing is to keep your seed and node secure. you must nail it and don't want to be hacked
