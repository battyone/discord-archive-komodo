wallet size doesn't change when you clean because cleared txes are padded, but all of the extra data is purged

[16-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 could you help me understand the workflow of UTXO's  and how NN operator goes about making best use of

[16-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
dont know if workflow is best word..

[16-Apr-19 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the shortest answer is that you:
want enough that you will not run out when attempting to notarize
want few enough that it doesn't bog down when selecting one to use

It's a balance that can be micromanaged to death or left with a general "this works"

[16-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how exactly is the balance 'managed' effective technique?

[16-Apr-19 09:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cleaning your wallet (or rebuilding as phm suggested) clears out extraneous (for our purposes) data that otherwise needs to be sorted through like any other database

[16-Apr-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how exactly is the balance 'managed' effective technique?`
automation is key, but should never be 100% left to think that it will "always" work properly
like anything else coded, the # of people you ask is how many answers you get as to what works "best"

[16-Apr-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mostly it's a "you have to watch and see what happens" thing to determine what you feel best with

[16-Apr-19 09:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what exactly are my ways of governing how my UTXOs get used ?

[16-Apr-19 09:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, for amount, that depends on how much your fastest chain moves in between the times you check and send your split transactions to the chain

[16-Apr-19 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the stats script from <https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary> run on a timer is an excellent starting place for observing

[16-Apr-19 09:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
been watching notarizations with stats script.. is setting utxo split and cleanwallet scripts to run too often what would lead to 'running out' of UTXO ?

[16-Apr-19 09:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you shouldn't be able to run it "too often" and run out unless you put some really odd numbers in there

[16-Apr-19 09:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
rule of thumb here? good starting values I can set and watch for a while vs. what I've had set ?

[16-Apr-19 09:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless your splitter is pulling your full balance

[16-Apr-19 09:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most of us run splitter ~ every 15 minutes

[16-Apr-19 09:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
want to see my script ?

[16-Apr-19 09:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd just confuse myself and you with me doing 4 things at once 😛

[16-Apr-19 09:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
👌

[16-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what should cleanwallet script to run on automation look like ?

[16-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
~ how often should it be run? Is there a logical amount if splitting every 15 mins ?

[16-Apr-19 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that one is another one that you can micromanage to death; I usually run cleaner ~ every 12-24 hrs

[16-Apr-19 10:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you set up splitting properly you'll only split if a certain amount isn't on-hand, so it's not like you're creating an extra bajillion UTXOs every day that go unused

[16-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I dont see any cleaner script in stakednotary

[16-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this a script that everyon must create on their own?

[16-Apr-19 10:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
is it really just one command which needs to be run every 12-24 hours ?

[16-Apr-19 10:10 PM] phm87#7395
clean_wallet.sh or sth like that

[16-Apr-19 10:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if I were to use one from labs, it'd be walletreset.sh

[16-Apr-19 10:11 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
there it is

[16-Apr-19 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`is it really just one command which needs to be run every 12-24 hours ?`
once for each chain, yes

[16-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I needed to know more about labs going into all this 😂

[16-Apr-19 10:38 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
does walletreset.sh need to be run for KMD ?

[16-Apr-19 11:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what is effective way to have stats script auto update to a tmux panel terminal when I'm already using crontab to automate utxo split and wallet reset scripts

[16-Apr-19 11:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
output to log and tail the best ?

[16-Apr-19 11:37 PM] phm87#7395
I prefer to run ./stats manually when I need it

[16-Apr-19 11:37 PM] phm87#7395
Otherwize, I use https://notarystats.info/testnet.php

[16-Apr-19 11:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
👌

[17-Apr-19 12:02 AM] phm87#7395
@webworker01  when I run simply ./stats I don't think that it loops automatically because after the output it stops (but maybe there is a .sh script to launch it) https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/stats

normal for pizza chain to have 4 notarizations and other 2 chains have none ?

[17-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
since last wallet reset

@Dr.Terminus  I also had similar problems but sometimes after a restart we should be patient

[17-Apr-19 12:08 AM] phm87#7395
make sure you have utxo for all AC and p2p ports opened

[17-Apr-19 12:10 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
when you say 'have utxo'

[17-Apr-19 12:11 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
u mean, stats shows an integer ?

on discord you can put a quote between two pairs of double or triple `

[17-Apr-19 12:13 AM] phm87#7395

[17-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
all i changes in utxosplitter.sh script was the 4 lines we discussed

[17-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
target utxo count

[17-Apr-19 12:20 AM] phm87#7395
yes but you should tweak these numbers

[17-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and split threshold

[17-Apr-19 12:20 AM] phm87#7395
to make tests

[17-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
15 and 10 for both kmd and other

[17-Apr-19 12:21 AM] phm87#7395
so you'll trick these values once per day and take notes to enhance the nota rate

the apostrophe should be in the other direction : you type ´ while you should use `

[17-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so.. I want my nn running the utxosplitterscript every 15 mins

[17-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
a script which specifies the target utxo count which is also set to 15

[17-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
for me anyways

[17-Apr-19 12:26 AM] phm87#7395
I think you make the crontab, I have no knowledges in crontab but you can check in the log if it run or had problems

[17-Apr-19 12:26 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this is the idea though, yes ?

[17-Apr-19 12:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
simply run the utxosplitte.sh script every 15 mins

[17-Apr-19 12:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and run walletreset.sh every 12 hours, see what I get ?

[17-Apr-19 12:27 AM] phm87#7395
10 and 15 were the values I tested with few days ago, then I'm trying now with 5 and 8

[17-Apr-19 12:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if I adjust values it should be my target and threshold UTXO's listed in those 4 lines in utxosplitter.sh script ?

[17-Apr-19 12:27 AM] phm87#7395
but I changed it one hour ago so I'll check tomorrow if I broke it

[17-Apr-19 12:28 AM] phm87#7395
about your question, I think yes

[17-Apr-19 12:39 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
👌

[17-Apr-19 12:43 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
target utxo = 8 and split threshold = 5 ?
