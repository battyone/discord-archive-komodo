really surprised nobody has reported that, seems like it must have been there for a very long time.

Thanks jl sorry. Found that error when porting to other coins, their gave warnings about int to uint

[04-Jun-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, best to put all externs in komodo_defs.h

[04-Jun-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
that way, if it conflicts with the actual declaration, it will give an error

[04-Jun-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
beta is updated

if on testnet and

gives you anything other than 
`Can't read block from disk` or `Block not found`
you're on an orphaned fork

[04-Jun-19 01:18 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm on the fork then.

[04-Jun-19 01:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Should I wipe TXSCLCC blocks and try to get on the correct chain, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

Is there anything Ishould be looking for @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?```"blocks": 269998,
  "longestchain": 269998,```

[04-Jun-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Jun-19 01:37 PM] Strob#3417
Hi guys! My main net node is ready since a while. I just let all chains in synch. But I just noticed my PANGEA is mining... is it normal?

[04-Jun-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Strob did you use the assetchains script in komodo/src? if so, it's set to randomly add gen to start

[04-Jun-19 01:38 PM] Strob#3417
I simply followed the guide exactly: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Setup-Komodo-Notary-Node

And yes it uses the assetchains script in the start script

[04-Jun-19 01:39 PM] NNoperator#3835
If you ran ./assetchains  then you should be mining a random assortment of 10% of AC

[04-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Strob#3417
Ok. I'm mining only PANGEA

[04-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Strob#3417
At least it's the only one with a balance other than zero

[04-Jun-19 01:40 PM] NNoperator#3835
sometimes you only get 1 or 2  sometimes more

[04-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Strob#3417
ok

[04-Jun-19 01:41 PM] CrisF#3405
```error code: -32603
error message:

```  if [ $[RANDOM % 10] == 1 ]; then
      gen=" -gen -genproclimit=1"
  fi```
if some random number is evenly dividable by 10, then it will mine that chain

[04-Jun-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
----------------------
@CrisF for what block?

[04-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Strob#3417
Ok yes I just found that? But what is it for?

[04-Jun-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But what is it for?`
to mine a random chain

[04-Jun-19 01:43 PM] NNoperator#3835
someone got to keep the coins rolling if CG isn't mining them for us.

[04-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Strob#3417
Any reason why we should mine a random chain?

Can't we use another hardware than our NN node for mining?

[04-Jun-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CrisF that's a good thing, you don't want that block, you want the hash of 269998 to be `017ad31c57d6d640e602ed6178be11e79281622c237f5e137a8684698f641bb6`

[04-Jun-19 01:44 PM] Strob#3417
Or is it part of the easy mining?

[04-Jun-19 01:44 PM] NNoperator#3835
many of those coins are diff  1,  can't get easier than that.

[04-Jun-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes you can other, no it's not part of easy

[04-Jun-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it just ensures that some NNs are mining some chains so that hopefully no one is mining no chains

_is going to see if he can mine 1500 blocks of TXSCLCC before 10 other people get updated, get off the bad fork, and start notarizing_

@blackjok3r  Do you know why the 2019NNtestnet seems broken ? I wanted to play a bit on it (I'm having issues to run the KMDLabs NN with the key of mylo ... still 0 notas ... I may reinstall everything a forth time)

@phm87 it’s been a wild day

[05-Jun-19 06:32 PM] phm87#7395
yeah I saw, I copy pasted and translated messages all day long. There is no emergency about 2019NNtestnet, we can discuss this in few days

[06-Jun-19 01:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Do you know why the 2019NNtestnet seems broken ?`
same as TXSCLCC, people stopped doing what needs to be done for it all to function

[06-Jun-19 04:45 AM] PHBA2061#2530
on 2019NNtestnet, aynone has nothing but `"bestk:-1` like me , with `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]`? 😭

[06-Jun-19 10:31 AM] zatJUM#9924
I have `bestk:-1` for everyone too

[06-Jun-19 10:59 AM] CrisF#3405
I also have `bestk:-1`

[07-Jun-19 07:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I have a theory in mind that could explain why the testnet stop notarizing, may be most NN testnest ops follow the official setup guide in order to prepare for the mainnet, so they accidentally killed the testnet iguana instance and forgot to restart it ?

[07-Jun-19 09:13 AM] mrlynch#5735
my testnet node is still live, although i'm considering shutting it down

[07-Jun-19 09:13 AM] mrlynch#5735
it seems we don't have enough minsigs for notas

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] phm87#7395
Mine is also still up. I'd like to have a testnet NN node and keep it 1 year to be able to test things somewhere else than mainet NN

[07-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Alright#0419
We'll have CFEK as a testnet year round if anyone wants to participate in that. Needs a bit of work to separate it from the LABS cluster though. Probably going to take at least a month to get up and running

[07-Jun-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
We'll have it separated prior to LABS's first scheduled hard fork. (2 months of blocks after block 1)

[07-Jun-19 11:39 PM] Greer#0666
I did follow the mainnet guide and would be interested in re-enabling BEER, PIZZA and TXSCLCC if it useful.  BEER is actually running on mine but on new pubkey, PIZZA failed to start and I'll need to add TXSCLCC to the assetchains.json.

[07-Jun-19 11:41 PM] Greer#0666
with regards to mainnet, Digital Ocean's firewall only allows 50 rules.  UFW enough?

locally: vmware workstation pro has it as a top menu option

So, is the BEER/PIZZA/TXSCLCC testnet done and over with or is just that many having issues that it's borked?

[09-Jun-19 10:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
can everyone verify that iguana testnet is still running on your nodes ? You might accidentally kill the iguana testnet instance if you go through every instructions in the official "Setup Komodo Notary Node"

[09-Jun-19 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
If this testnet wants to survive, needs someone to manage it like I was. I can't take this on right now, I'd suggest everyone move to the CFEK testnet once it's set up though

[09-Jun-19 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
you can always setup your own testnet with 2 nodes btw
