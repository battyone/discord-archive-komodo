don't forget to add TXSCLCC in komodo/src/assetchains.json

[09-Apr-19 01:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
`sudo ln -sf ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli /usr/local/bin`

Any idea?

[09-Apr-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@MadCryptoHead you have to edit the json file that it calls to match NNtest chains

[09-Apr-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
like:
```JSON
[
  {
    "ac_name": "BEER"
  },
  {
    "ac_name": "PIZZA"
  },
  {
    "ac_name": "TXSCLCC"
  }
]```

[09-Apr-19 02:47 PM] Strob#3417
Yes the webworker01 stats

[09-Apr-19 02:47 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I have added to assetchains.json the following

[09-Apr-19 02:47 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I am going to add BEER and PIZZA too

[09-Apr-19 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't need the details since you're only using it for stats

[09-Apr-19 02:48 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Ok, let's remove the unnecesary details

[09-Apr-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[09-Apr-19 02:50 PM] gt#2812

yeah, that's the one I gave him link to

[09-Apr-19 02:54 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I removed KMD from coinlist and I have left it in this way:

coinlist=(
'BEER 100000000'
'PIZZA 100000000'
'TXSCLCC 0'
)

woud be ok?

[09-Apr-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@MadCryptoHead which "stats" file are you using, webby's or the one from KMDLabs?

I did

[09-Apr-19 03:00 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
by putting the comment hashsign before that lines

[09-Apr-19 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd remove them, rather than commenting them out, otherwise you'll never track down the issue with the line numbers bash returns

[09-Apr-19 03:01 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
from 156 for coins in "${othercoins[@]}"; do  until 207 done

[09-Apr-19 03:03 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
let's give it a try 😃

[09-Apr-19 03:10 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
ok I have removed the lines, the results are the same

[09-Apr-19 03:12 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
the results are right but they are just being displayed wrongly. Now I am wondering why I have notarized nothing in 3 hours

[09-Apr-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`being displayed wrongly.`
wrong spacing? or ....?

[09-Apr-19 03:16 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
-CHAIN-     -NOTR- -LASTN- -UTXO-    -BAL-   -BLOX- -LASTB- -CON- -SIZE-
./stats: line 143: printf: 5.22477999: invalid number
KMD[U]                        768    0,000  1305800     49s 16   136K 0 mined

As you can see the balance is being showd in the upper line (5.22477999), instead of under the -BAL- column

[09-Apr-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not in the column because bash is telling you that there's something in the code that will not accept that to print
that's why it says "invalid number"

[09-Apr-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
'line 143' <- that's bash telling you where it sees the issue (which may or may not actually be line 143, depending on the amount of whitespace in the script)

[09-Apr-19 03:23 PM] zatJUM#9924
Could it be a locale problem too?

[09-Apr-19 03:24 PM] zatJUM#9924
e.g. try add `LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"` at the beginning of the script

[09-Apr-19 03:27 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Right, my line 143 is the 145 in the original stats bash

[09-Apr-19 03:30 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
lol, it seems that it was the @zatJUM solution

[09-Apr-19 03:30 PM] zatJUM#9924
Many scripts don't work because of that

[09-Apr-19 03:31 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I have added that line at the top of the script and now is working
