<@CrisF `The rescan went well, `
Did you have to create a zaddress or you just used z_importkey with your rprivate key?

[28-Apr-19 11:16 AM] CrisF#3405
👋
I did `z_getnewaddress`, validated and exported z_key.  I used that z_key in what you posted.  They are pretty long keys, eh!

`used z_importkey with your rprivate key?` you can't do that 😛

That didn't seem to help with BEER though.  Still getting `000000000000000000000000`s and now no connections :abusedsmily:

[28-Apr-19 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no one has hit beer in over 2 hrs despite blocks rolling

[28-Apr-19 11:25 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it seems like everybody is getting `bestk -1` on BEER

[28-Apr-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll leave mine up and see how connections come along.

[28-Apr-19 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
No dramatic change in anyone's iguana connections?

[28-Apr-19 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my `bestk > 0` drops to 0 every time beer comes up, but other than that usually in the 20s

[28-Apr-19 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I restarted iguana and haven't gotten any connections after 2 hours or so.

[28-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Lumbi#8378
these tweaks have been metal.. iguana is running like a top and I can even `cleantransactions` 🏎

other than that, it looks nice

now that you have it working, I remind you that since we use `cleanwallettransactions` wallet size is meaningless 😛

`git show commitid` in a repo will show you if that commit exists there. And yes, that commit is in the FSM and jl777 branches, which github renders as well: `https://github.com/jl777/komodo/commit/78162cf103804c0f7483d7258cdeed601a7fcb58`

[28-Apr-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
don't always trust the github web UI though, it has bugs just like everything else.

[28-Apr-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
the only possible thing that the above commit can do, is save people time, it's pretty low risk

[28-Apr-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
it may also mean less down-time for exchanges and pools, in some situations

@dukeleto  I am using the search of github, it works fine but when it bugs, I git clone the branch and I make a big grep in all the files. But I don't use very well git. I didn' know for ``git show`` command, thank you

and about my question, I didn't mean for us but mostly for mainstream users (imagine non IT persons using KMD) but I hope that they will use Agama so I don't think that they will have such problems

It's a testnet but the total not count is still published along the voting results... 🙄 I hope there was a rule on the tesnet to divide NN evenly and prevent relocating. That would have give a better idea of NN op skills to the voters.

you can't do some tests in mainnet for your own good.
