@PHBA2061  And I guess if someone prefer to vote for someone who is not hiding they will know what to do... 😉

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Its a fair point, shouldn't be down to one or two people - thats not fair on them

[13-Apr-19 10:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
`Do we have to verify m_notary_testnet each time we git pull astonished` errm.. yes

[13-Apr-19 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@newvulcan I was specifically meaning that pull is in the script

[13-Apr-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're still doing a pull even if you don't actually type `git pull`

[13-Apr-19 10:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
@newvulcan @zatJUM add the \ in m_notary_testnet and comment out # git pull

[13-Apr-19 10:15 PM] newvulcan#4719
Does this possibly mean this is lurking in everyones install, just no one has come across it because there haven't been any restarts ?

[13-Apr-19 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Are there any points for the most even amount of nota's per chain?

[13-Apr-19 11:10 PM] newvulcan#4719
k, back to business. Don't know how I missed this, and I don't know if its something wrong but I've noticed this error buried in the iguana log file.

{"error":"source address or dest address has no privkey, importprivkey","tag":"3
076127090691540653"}

It doesn't appear to be stopping iguana from running, and the only coin still giving problems is TXSCLCC, I'm notarizing quite happily on the other two. I've checked the coins directory and there are files for BEER_7776, PIZZA_776 and TXSCLCC_7776.

I've searched back, and I can only find this mentioned a few times before but way back in June last year, and it had something to do with missing _7776 files

[13-Apr-19 11:11 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
did you import your privkey into the TXSCLCC chain

[13-Apr-19 11:12 PM] newvulcan#4719
I think so, but I'll check back - I've tried to keep a history of everything I've done, just in case.

[13-Apr-19 11:15 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
just run `validateaddress` with your pubkey's wallet address

[13-Apr-19 11:17 PM] newvulcan#4719
Oh, I see a scriptPubKey entry for it, but not a pubkey entry for it like BEER, KMD and PIZZA, so yes looks like I forgot to do it

[13-Apr-19 11:20 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You should see `"ismine": true,`

[13-Apr-19 11:21 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
if that says false, you haven't imported the privkey for your address

[13-Apr-19 11:21 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
if not, i'd `importprivkey` and send funds to that address and split, etc

I think he meant the nota ratio of 3 chains, in his case is very close to 1:1:1 ? 😕

@PTYX there are tags for each of those running but since it only goes to 100 is why I added "once folks start actively casting votes"
