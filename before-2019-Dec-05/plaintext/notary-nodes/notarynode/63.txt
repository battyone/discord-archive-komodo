@Strob two lines have been added in m_notary_testnet to add the new chain to notarizations
```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"conf\":\"TXSCLCC.conf\",\"path\":\"${HOME#"/"}/.komodo/TXSCLCC\",\"unitval\":\"20\",\"zcash\":1,\"RELAY\":-1,\"VALIDATE\":0,\"prefetchlag\":........```
```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"timeout\":60000,\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"dpow\",\"symbol\":\"TXSCLCC\",\"pubkey\":\"$pubkey\"}"```
first "adds" the coin to iguana (iguana is able to talk with daemon and to receive curl commands like used for the split)
second launches the dpow (and should normally wait the split has been confirmed, but not a big deal)

[31-Mar-19 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
that file has the curl line you need to add it to iguana

[31-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Strob#3417
ah ok I need to add them before running it damn!

[31-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Strob#3417
Ok it was pulled but I need to restart again I guess

[31-Mar-19 09:30 PM] SHossain#0007
@Strob @metaphilibert @CHMEX @jorian @mrlynch @Lumbi please use the following command in the iguana dir
```
git pull
./m_notary_testnet
```

[31-Mar-19 09:31 PM] SHossain#0007
just added a new chain to give the ops some near real-life tasks of NN

[31-Mar-19 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007
the chain is just a test chain mainly created for Mihailo for CC development

[31-Mar-19 09:32 PM] Strob#3417
Ok now I got TXSCLCC in the log!

[31-Mar-19 09:33 PM] metaphilibert#0926
i bet i will forgot to uncomment the nosplit in the coming  iguana updates haha

[31-Mar-19 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
> Update and launch iguana just by using `./m_notary_testnet` which will then start notarizing the new chain.
i guess most of us missed `Update` = `git pull` 😛

[31-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
the chain doesn't have CCs?

[31-Mar-19 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
not sure what you mean?

[31-Mar-19 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
it is an -ac_cc=2 chain

[31-Mar-19 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
not actively being used

[31-Mar-19 09:36 PM] SHossain#0007
very lightly used and i've been mining for last few months and notarizing

[31-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
Ah misread the params

[31-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
you don't need the index lines in startup if ac_cc is set

[31-Mar-19 09:37 PM] SHossain#0007
Pinned a message.

[31-Mar-19 09:38 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, (not sure why i did that in the first place and never changed it)

[31-Mar-19 09:40 PM] metaphilibert#0926
what are you talking about?

[31-Mar-19 09:40 PM] SHossain#0007
`-addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -`

[31-Mar-19 09:40 PM] metaphilibert#0926
aah spent and addressindex

[31-Mar-19 09:40 PM] Strob#3417
@metaphilibert  look like you forgot to stop mining http://txsclcc.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RX1tP6ftwe96p6scgJn4dpgNdHDgyg9R87

[31-Mar-19 09:40 PM] metaphilibert#0926
ah?

[31-Mar-19 09:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926
we were supposed to stop mining?

I heard it will be on binance and next samsung phones tomorrow...

[31-Mar-19 09:43 PM] metaphilibert#0926
i am sure this is a chain with big potential
and it will be secured by dpow soon (on testnet but hey it is dpowed for real)

[31-Mar-19 09:43 PM] SHossain#0007
it's ok if you guys want to mine with only 1 CPU thread

[31-Mar-19 09:43 PM] metaphilibert#0926
i stay stuck on one tread i promise

[31-Mar-19 09:43 PM] SHossain#0007
i just didn't want your wallet.dat size to grow fast

[31-Mar-19 09:44 PM] metaphilibert#0926
so kind of you 😉

[31-Mar-19 09:45 PM] newvulcan#4719
I have a server which I can repurpose as a notary node, meets all the min specs. What I'd like to ask is - I can get a 350Mbps down/21Mbps up fibre line into our premises - is that good enough, given I see the spec requires 100Mbps ? A 100Mbps leased line into our premises is more expensive than a rented dedicated server.

[31-Mar-19 09:45 PM] Alright#0419
```
# Unlock all lockunspents to make sure we can access all our utxo!
komodo-cli lockunspent true `komodo-cli listlockunspent | jq -c .`
```
fuuuuuuuuuu

[31-Mar-19 09:45 PM] Alright#0419
should have looked at that before I ran it 😫

[31-Mar-19 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
what happened?

[31-Mar-19 09:46 PM] metaphilibert#0926
No unlocked utxo available?

[31-Mar-19 09:47 PM] Alright#0419
my scripts will lock anything that isn't 0.0001 then cleanwallettransactions

[31-Mar-19 09:47 PM] Alright#0419
not sure if it will mess that up, but I think I need to redo utxos

[31-Mar-19 09:48 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Haha advanced tools

[31-Mar-19 09:48 PM] Alright#0419
why is that only for KMD?

[31-Mar-19 09:48 PM] Alright#0419
why is that there at all?

[31-Mar-19 09:49 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Just maintain between 15 and 25 utxos and you should be good
And with only 2 chains for 2 months not sure we need to clean KMD wallet

[31-Mar-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright that addition was requested by @blackjok3r back in sep last year and @webworker01 supplied the command

[31-Mar-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
```
If you start iguana, on dpowasets call, it will lock 1 utxo for each coin
if you need to resatrt iguana it does not unlock them again.
:pray:
someone can make a script that purges all lockunspents on KMD for m_notary_run ?
looks like you need to call listlockunspent and iteratte lockunspent false o them all, there is no unlock all that I can find atm... but didnt look too hard. very busy
```

[31-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
does it not do the same for chains other than kmd?

[31-Mar-19 09:54 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm no expert on that. while updating today i just noticed this was missing from the testnet file and wanted to add. probably you can just comment this out and  restart you komodo daemon

[31-Mar-19 09:55 PM] metaphilibert#0926
It only locks KMD utxo's afaik

[31-Mar-19 09:55 PM] SHossain#0007
when we created the testnet file last year, this solution wasn't there

[31-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
is there an explorer for TXSCLCC?

[31-Mar-19 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
only KMD utxos are in contention from the different notarizations

[31-Mar-19 09:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
when it notarized last on that chain for you hope it makes sense

[31-Mar-19 09:58 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Hahaha was wondering also

[31-Mar-19 09:58 PM] SHossain#0007
it does

didn't notice the filters until you said

[31-Mar-19 10:06 PM] SHossain#0007
you provided the oneliner
```
webworker0118/09/2018
can probably make it a one liner
komodo-cli lockunspent true `komodo-cli listlockunspent | jq -c .` 
```

[31-Mar-19 10:16 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I remember too
I was afraid, after the merge of the black joker, there were tiny poor KMD utxo's locked everywhere
Then a frog came with a one line script to free them all

your node is doing good in the last few hours @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[31-Mar-19 10:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
probably because ppl finally added it to theirs 😛

[31-Mar-19 10:17 PM] metaphilibert#0926
But you know, I discovered  you can use only ```
komodo-cli lockunspent true```
It does the trick

[31-Mar-19 10:17 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Not obliged to specify all the locked utxo's

[31-Mar-19 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from a yr ago? surely not 😛

[31-Mar-19 10:19 PM] SHossain#0007
`./m_notary_run` file already has this fix since then and all NN has been using it by default (unless they are using custom)

[31-Mar-19 10:20 PM] metaphilibert#0926
? it unlocks the locked KMD utxo when even killing it softly?

[31-Mar-19 10:21 PM] metaphilibert#0926
-15, not the fugees (shit got it in my head now)

[31-Mar-19 10:21 PM] metaphilibert#0926
if you kill softly iguan, it may be some locked KMD utxo's

[31-Mar-19 10:22 PM] metaphilibert#0926
using lockunspent could be a good idea to avoid many utxo's locked after many kill/restart of iguana

[31-Mar-19 10:23 PM] metaphilibert#0926
sorry not clear if you kill softly iguan, it may be some utxo's that are left in a locked state

[31-Mar-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how far back do I need to scroll to seen the beginning of the convo of why we're un/locking manually?

[31-Mar-19 10:24 PM] metaphilibert#0926
if you stop it in anyway, in fact

[31-Mar-19 10:24 PM] metaphilibert#0926
it is locked by iguana (automatically)

[31-Mar-19 10:25 PM] metaphilibert#0926
if you close iguana it could happen at a moment iguana already reserved (locked) some utxo , but did not free them

[31-Mar-19 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh

[31-Mar-19 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[31-Mar-19 10:26 PM] metaphilibert#0926
so after some stops, they may be too much locked utxo
free them from time to time with lockunspent true is not a bad idea

[31-Mar-19 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, just stop stopping it 😛

[31-Mar-19 10:28 PM] metaphilibert#0926
not my fault, it is @SHossain who is asking to restart from some reasons :troll:

[31-Mar-19 10:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's because I wasn't home

[31-Mar-19 10:28 PM] SHossain#0007
did i mess up wording?
