Combine that with unlimited bandwitdh 100mbit connection and your done üòÉ

[21-Feb-19 11:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can get a 256GB of ram in them for a few hundred extra,when you can find one.

[21-Feb-19 11:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
goes up to 512GB, at that point we would be dpow like 150 coins

[21-Feb-19 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and Debian9 > ubuntu 16 IMO

[21-Feb-19 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
9.6 to be exact.

[21-Feb-19 11:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
good to know

[21-Feb-19 11:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
16.04 it is

[21-Feb-19 11:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[21-Feb-19 11:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
You make a good point

[21-Feb-19 11:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you mentioned Debian right ?

[21-Feb-19 11:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
A fair few of us use 9.6 yes

much more in depth though, and msot of it was scripted

[21-Feb-19 11:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I doubt he scripts stil work tbh. It was msotly for my own notes. I built 2 ir 3 nodes before I got it right. Wrote all my own scripts to control coins etc, ans the uincluded ones were not great. Mostly a learning excersise for myself at the time, being new to linux.

[21-Feb-19 11:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wanted to understand how it worked. rather than just make it work. üòÉ

[21-Feb-19 11:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I see.. So much to learn still

[21-Feb-19 11:59 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I think I am going to get hosting company i already paid to work with me

[21-Feb-19 11:59 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how long ~ does it take once I can log into my system to complete nn setup to the point of downloading chaindata ?

[22-Feb-19 12:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
depends really.. Basically once you have komodo built, you can sync all chains.

[22-Feb-19 12:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the rest comes after that. So really not long at all.

[22-Feb-19 12:06 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so ready to begin

[22-Feb-19 12:06 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269

https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/README.md
Not 100% sure but maybe some people pulled out, the KMD elections are in June I think, so plenty of time. LABS will have its first avalible spots after only 2 months and is just about to launch. We automated a lot of it, but the basics are still the same, to learn how it works and what software does what etc.

[22-Feb-19 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure can. We increase the number by 2 nodes each 2 months, provided someone wants to join.

[28-Feb-19 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
@Dr.Terminus the StakedNotary is very specific to LABS as of right now

[28-Feb-19 01:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so I can't become part of LABS ? cant go about it this way at all ?

[28-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
LABS is an entirely separate notary network. We're cap at 20 notaries right now. All the positions are currently filled, but we will be adding 2 additional spots every 2 months

[28-Feb-19 01:33 PM] Alright#0419
running a LABS notary is a bit different than running a KMD notary, but it's good for understanding what is required from you as a notary OP

[28-Feb-19 01:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I see.. do LABS notaries get KMD rewards?

[28-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'm still at phase 1.. Haven't even yet assured this hardware I've rented can meet requirments.. Am I needing to join another testnet or what? Is there any way I can stand chance to gain rewards getting a NN up and running now ?

[28-Feb-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
LABS notaries will earn LABS. It's a separate coin

[28-Feb-19 01:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ahhh

[28-Feb-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
There is no way for you for to notarize/earn KMD unless elected

[28-Feb-19 01:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
next election in june right ?

[28-Feb-19 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how can I test my hardware / environment ahead of time ? show / prove that I have system up and running to vote for ?

[28-Feb-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
estimated to be June, yes

[28-Feb-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Dr.Terminus practicing as a LABS notary is probably the best way to prepare

@Dr.Terminus  Before voting on notaries 2018 there was a testnet to demonstrate proficiency and readiness.  A good amount of VOTE was distributed to the participants who got nodes up and running in the testnet.

[28-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Strob#3417
I'll try to setup a LABS notary too. Would like to notarize KMD one day!

[28-Feb-19 06:51 PM] Strob#3417
Is there any cost other than electricity for running these even as a test? Do we also need to fund a BTC address for KMDLABS notarization?

[28-Feb-19 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
see #kmdlabs for LABS details. LABS only notarizes to KMD, so you'll need some KMD

[28-Feb-19 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
and btw, you can set one up, but as @Alright already stated: ```We're cap at 20 notaries right now. All the positions are currently filled, but we will be adding 2 additional spots every 2 months```

[28-Feb-19 07:05 PM] jorian#4555
i am sure there will be a KMD notary testnet (likely a soft prerequisite for new notaries) up around the start of the election period

[28-Feb-19 07:29 PM] Strob#3417
Ok nice. It's just for testing and learning.

Good afternoon,

[01-Mar-19 07:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
PirateChain is looking at running for some Notary Nodes this year to have the funding support the development, listing fees and others expenses and growth related items.  
@mrlynch and I will work in coordination throughout the year to maintain the nodes and use the funding to effectively grow the KMD ecosystem.
Where can we find out more about the upcoming elections?  June is the estimated date?

[01-Mar-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
Q2, i hope in april

[01-Mar-19 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We want to be prepared and figure out ways that we can benefit Pirate and KMD through this. 

We don't want to burn people out on our propaganda too soon, so is this the best channel to stay tuned for the announce?   #notarynode-announce  ?
