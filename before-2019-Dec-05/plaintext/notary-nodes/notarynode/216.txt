[14-Jun-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a just a stupid car, after if broke I was like man, need to cut losses, cost lie 1000H and $10,000 at least to make it, not worth $1000 even running because it uses 98oct patrol only, which is $1.70 a litre, and teh tank is 100L.... gets 300km to a tank maybe less

[14-Jun-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[14-Jun-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If I put it in granny-low and dump the clutch, yes 🙃

[14-Jun-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[15-Jun-19 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well to be fair, that engine was running so rich it was blowing black smoke, I guess if ibever put it back together and tune it, should get about 2x the range 😂

[15-Jun-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If anyone wants to give me $30,000 I'll chuck a turbo barra in it with 650hp 🤣

[15-Jun-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although in prefer to keep it how it is, with an engine I built myself from the parts of 6 other cars all mashed together.

Hey guys, sorry about the confusion over this. Have had my head down for the past week or so. I won't be organizing a hard fork test for ARRR as joker wants to do it by himself

[18-Jun-19 07:56 PM] zatJUM#9924

[18-Jun-19 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for now, please, no one add COQUI to their notary nodes.

[18-Jun-19 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

if you already have HUSH on your node from s2, `git pull` and `build.sh` and restart will work. If you are new, the doc above is what you want

Unfortunately, I have no choice but to propose to sell my 2 notarynodes, JL officially claimed it was worth 40K, so be it. It will make Barterlly funded and ready to begin fighting, and tring to make KMD shine
