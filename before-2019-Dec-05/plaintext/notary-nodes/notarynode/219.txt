@kimmel (Pungo.io) sorry for the late answer. I know what DC you're talking about and thats actually 4 datacenters, not 2. If you need any help dealing with them DM me

[31-Jul-19 01:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
My nodes are theorically sold out to @ca333 , we agreed on terms sunday, and am awaiting his sending to give the privs, I hope this won't take too much time, and it seems I won't annoy anyone else anymore now, I never harmed the network, and devoted my life to KMD. @ca333 is a very busy man, unfortunately I wans't able to talk with him since the agreement, and I hope it will be done soon, so I will be able to move on.

the donations will be made weekly moving forward in an automated way based on percentages listed below (link)

@mrlynch let us know what address you send funds to Labs. I want to contribute as well but haven’t yet got an answer for where to send funds.

[03-Aug-19 01:10 PM] mrlynch#5735

Thank you and sorry for the mistake

[04-Aug-19 01:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, as we spoke about, I'll send it to the multisig after it's testing is complete unless you request otherwise.

[04-Aug-19 08:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @black carp,
Alright posted the Labs multisig addresses above, but please don't send funds to them until you receive confirmation from him.  (Check before sending)
Thanks for your donations :labs:

[04-Aug-19 11:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
@Alright you might want to remove the multisig addresses until confirmed OK
some might get trigger happy and send to those

was it as simple as sendtoaddress  bDEVo3E4jnZa418BExJJ99RkPqcj8ETEhf to make that transaction happen?

[04-Aug-19 04:43 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @NNoperator , Please don't send any funds to the KMDLabs address (bDEVo3E4jnZa418BExJJ99RkPqcj8ETEhf) until you have confirmation from Alright.

[04-Aug-19 04:43 PM] CrisF#3405
(Just in case)

[04-Aug-19 04:48 PM] NNoperator#3835
sure,  I am waiting to see how mrlynch sent  his transaction, and will wait for Alright

[04-Aug-19 04:50 PM] CrisF#3405
Mr. Lynch's Labs donation went to a temporary holding address while the Labs address is being tested I believe.

sendmany :troll:

[04-Aug-19 04:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
you can use `sendtoaddress` to send to a p2sh `b..`address too, what's complicated is spending from it

[04-Aug-19 04:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I see no outgoing tx from `bDEVo3E4jnZa418BExJJ99RkPqcj8ETEhf`, may be you guys should  to spend from it first before receiving donation, just in case ?

[04-Aug-19 04:51 PM] NNoperator#3835
Do you know why the recipients  in mrlynch's transaction were divided to in differing amounts?

[04-Aug-19 04:52 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, @PHBA2061 that is being tested now.

[04-Aug-19 04:53 PM] CrisF#3405
Please don't anyone send funds to the Labs donation addresses until notice from Alright.

[04-Aug-19 04:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
probably mrlynch didn't use sendtoaddress but createrawtransaction instead with multiple vout, signed then sent it, I'm not sure

[04-Aug-19 04:55 PM] CrisF#3405
@NNoperator , I believe PIRATE pledged different amounts to different causes. (Not sure how he did it :abusedsmily: )

[04-Aug-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it would be a createraw, the amounts are calcualted based on the % he plegded... I thaught that would be quite obvious...

[04-Aug-19 05:00 PM] NNoperator#3835
My mistake,  I thought that specific transaction was going to Labs alone.  Please disregard.

[04-Aug-19 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Aug-19 05:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
i think i burned the interest tho :abusedsmily: well not burned but made a miner happy

[04-Aug-19 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wasn't me 😦

[05-Aug-19 08:48 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I notice that everytime I'm eligible to easymine, the `lastmined` key & its value are removed from `getinfo` output, and later return after I successfully mine a block. Isn't that a bit strange, why doesn't it just stay there ?
