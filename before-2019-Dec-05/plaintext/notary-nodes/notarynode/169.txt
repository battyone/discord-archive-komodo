My PIZZA wallet is more than 7x the size of BEER.  Roughly similar nuber of notarizations and they were restarted at the same time.

[24-Apr-19 05:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Anyone notice anything that might explain this?

@Dr.Terminus you can also stop the daemon, remove peers and addnode every peer you feel healthy, that way you ll clear the seeds list and rebuild one with "static" entries, dynamic ones being catched over time

@CrisF iguanas shun beer in the wild... pizza is not good for them either, but some of them have been known to become voracious during lab experiments.

[24-Apr-19 11:42 PM] Alright#0419
send to another node t->z, delete the wallet, importprivkey without rescan then send it back z->t?

[24-Apr-19 11:43 PM] NNoperator#3835
So that receiving node can be non-elected node then ?

[24-Apr-19 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
has to be a z addr on the other node

[24-Apr-19 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
the rule is that PIRATE can have no transparent outputs unless all outputs of the transaction are elected notaries addresses

rookie error, I reindexed my beer chain with the dust affected wallet in it 游뱑

[25-Apr-19 07:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is there any reason when I am importing my privkey into a new wallet with `importprivkey PRIVKEYHERE "" false` That it would then show an amount in that address? It is only happening with my PIZZA wallet, didn't occur with any of the others

[25-Apr-19 07:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is giving me the error ```Error: The transaction was rejected! This might happen if some of the coins in your wallet were already spent, such as if you used a copy of wallet.dat and coins were spent in the copy but not marked as spent here.```
`listaddressgroupings` is showing funds in both the wallet I have with coins in it, and the wallet I imported with the `importprivkey PRIVKEYHERE "" false` command

[25-Apr-19 07:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Just to clarify. I deleted `wallet.dat` and restarted. Imported an addressA with `importprivkey XXX` that had funds in it. I then imported another addressB that has no funds in (I sent them out) with `importprivkey XXX "" false`. I am then trying to send funds from address A to address B and receiving this error.

[25-Apr-19 07:54 AM] CrisF#3405
This sounds like something @blackjok3r might be interested in.  He's done a few wallet autopsies recently :abusedsmily:

[25-Apr-19 07:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Confirm using the `"" false` at the end of the import should not scan any blocks for wallet funds?

[25-Apr-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless the most recent 144 blocks are usually in memory anyway

[25-Apr-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so if recent transactions, it will pick up some funds

[25-Apr-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
no rescan means dont do any extra scanning

[25-Apr-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt mean ignore anything you already know about

[25-Apr-19 07:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Hmm, if I sent the funds out the address, why wouldn't it pick that up? Also, it is an amount that is much higher than the amount I sent

[25-Apr-19 07:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`0.77598091,` is showing in the wallet with no funds, whereas I actually had `0.68250559,` +txfee prior to sending the funds out

[25-Apr-19 07:59 AM] PHBA2061#2530
0.77598091 is the result returned with `getbalance` ?

[25-Apr-19 07:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIZZA getbalance
1.45848650```

[25-Apr-19 07:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's adding them both (two addresses with those amount )

[25-Apr-19 07:59 AM] PHBA2061#2530
and `listunspent ` ?

[25-Apr-19 08:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There are 3 unspents. 1 from my addressA 2 from addressB
This is from addressB```    "txid": "e94cb30612e183651fbcce7288dd072ab34a6d8155358ebc39aef4af6d5fe2d9",

[25-Apr-19 08:06 AM] PHBA2061#2530
how about address A ? the one you just show,, it is actually already spent, so if you won't be able to spend it (see the "S" at the end) https://pizza.kmdexplorer.io/tx/e94cb30612e183651fbcce7288dd072ab34a6d8155358ebc39aef4af6d5fe2d9

[25-Apr-19 08:08 AM] PHBA2061#2530
when using `false`, if some funds show up, I think it's better to verify on block explorer it's already spent or not, because no rescan = your wallet could miss some transactions

[25-Apr-19 08:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I understand that it is already spent. I just don't know why it is showing up in my wallet when I import using the `"" false` method

[25-Apr-19 08:17 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Im guessing I'll need to reindex or rescan to get the wallet rehacked again

[25-Apr-19 08:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Rescan gets the addressB showing 0 funds in it, but everytime I stop the chain, delete `wallet.dat`, restart the chain, `importprivkey XXX "" false`, I get that same `0.77598091` amount showing in the address..

[25-Apr-19 08:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I will just rescan and use the `cleanwallettransactions` to reduce the size and move on, but that seems like there is some sort of a problem there. Has anyone seen that before?

[25-Apr-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
DB messed up

[25-Apr-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
rescan

[25-Apr-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you dont want to

[25-Apr-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
messing with wallet using these clean wallets can easily get it into a strange state

[25-Apr-19 09:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I have and it works itself out. Every time I import with the `false` now it comes back with that same amount aha.

[25-Apr-19 02:07 PM] SHossain#0007
you can also try double quotes `importprivkey XXX """" false`

[25-Apr-19 02:42 PM] jorian#4555
