@Lumbi why dont you make same level of coolness long description in your notarynode main page (on github)?

yep. HDDs will fade away as SSDs now comes in big sizes. price just needs to go down for those

[01-Apr-19 10:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
after doing a manual split, my node suddenly performed poorly, is it just me or is there anyone encountered the same thing ? 😕

[01-Apr-19 10:27 PM] SHossain#0007
it's random

```They'll join the floppies in the junkyard```  hard to belive one of those  SSD holds about 818,880 floppies worth of data.  At least it wont take up that much space when it gets disposed of.

[01-Apr-19 10:33 PM] NNoperator#3835
My new server will have big SSDs too,  but I won't get a photo to share . 😞

[01-Apr-19 10:34 PM] PHBA2061#2530
hm, it's still weird though, before doing the utxo split my node literally participated in almost every single notarization, and I keep the number of utxo below 50  🤔

[01-Apr-19 11:08 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I just look at the IP of testnet notaries; there are already 12 from EU +  2 from UK 😂

[01-Apr-19 11:16 PM] Strob#3417
I'm in canada

[01-Apr-19 11:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah there is 1 from CAN, 1 from AUS, 3 from US, 1 from JAP

[01-Apr-19 11:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the rest are located in EU (12) + UK (2)

[01-Apr-19 11:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Strob,```... you are back on track```
Seems like I made a few notarsations over night.  Still far below what I was making before, but there are also many more participating.
 Only thing I did differently than before was to go to sleep, haha.
See yours has picked up a lot 😃

[01-Apr-19 11:59 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll basically leave it alone today and get a feel for it.

does KMD team not really refer to Komodo blockchain platform as Supernet anymore?

[02-Apr-19 12:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Waterfox can’t find the server at notarystats.info.` 😦

[02-Apr-19 12:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The increase of min SIG's will help people with lower counts be included. Could be an explanation. Also its random...  Donating to ecosystem projects is not vote share is it? 🤔

[02-Apr-19 12:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I hope not, because a couple dev funds will see donations from me 😕

[02-Apr-19 01:24 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[02-Apr-19 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./komodo-cli getnewaddress` 😄

[02-Apr-19 01:25 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
i dont have node yet

[02-Apr-19 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For the nodes actual address, Its best to generate it on the node after election so as not to possibly leak it

[02-Apr-19 01:25 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ahvent spun up new environment on hosting service yet..

[02-Apr-19 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anything is fine

[02-Apr-19 01:25 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
dont wanna use agama install with my personal wallet to gen new address do i ?

[02-Apr-19 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its just address to receive votes

[02-Apr-19 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can gen the Notary address later after election

[02-Apr-19 01:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok

[02-Apr-19 01:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269

for NN's, can your testnet server be lower spec than what you will actually deploy if elected? Burned $640 on a loss last year 😄

Im using a 4GB 2 core VPS

[02-Apr-19 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a bit small tbh Id go at least 2x that

[02-Apr-19 01:44 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm using quite powerful server and quite suck so far 😂

[02-Apr-19 01:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Losing vs 4GB 2 core VPS last 6 hours 😃 So software tuning seems to be much more important than hardware

[02-Apr-19 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I/O speed and enough RAM. Nothing else matters, that said syncing all the 50 chaina t the same time on 2 CPU cores wont be fun 😛

I got sick of looking at that last season and put all the blockchains exept BTC in a RAM disk

[02-Apr-19 01:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ram disk? ppl still do that after 2004?

[02-Apr-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was to test if nvme would help ... for the record it made only a marginal imporvment

[02-Apr-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That could be that is saturated the mem bandwidth tho on DDR3 not sure

Hi @CrisF ! 
```css
 Only thing I did differently than before was to go to sleep, haha. See yours has picked up a lot 
```
Yes it's unbelievable how my node picked up. Here is what I did ( click to see):  || I doubled check my router settings, firewall and fail2ban and made sure all the p2p ports are open and I added all the ip of all notaries in fail2ban so they never trigger it. I also added maxconnections=125 to each of my .conf files. But my peers are still 16-16-16-14 though... Before that I also sent to myself to merge my utxo and use komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions but it didn't clean that much I will add a daily cron for that. I also setup iguana to not autosplit. And a cron job every 2 hours to split KMD to 60 and AC to 20 using Decker script.||

Can syncing from bootstrap theoretical increase performance somehow over manual syncing?

[02-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
no, shouldn't make a difference

[02-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
syncing from a bootstrap could cause your node to fork I believe

[02-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
if it's a bad bootstrap

[02-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
so best not to use them for vital nodes unless it's your own bootstrap

[02-Apr-19 03:42 AM] TonyL#3577

We were added with popcornbag together yesterday and have pretty similar amount of notarizations

[02-Apr-19 03:44 AM] TonyL#3577
But both losing to nodes which were added before us

[02-Apr-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
Ohh I thought you meant first people to update

[02-Apr-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, that's quite possible

[02-Apr-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
these stats aren't a great metric anyway
