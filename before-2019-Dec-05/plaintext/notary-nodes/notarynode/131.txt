Im up for the job :)

[14-Apr-19 11:34 PM] phm87#7395
@kolo  for the pool, we had to have a link very rapid between several continents, I am thinking about a similar trick to help SH region to get better connected

[14-Apr-19 11:34 PM] phm87#7395
I forgot the name of this link but I can find it back

[14-Apr-19 11:35 PM] kolo#1111
Do ping measures from european and AR IX-es

[14-Apr-19 11:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I will be putting my node in Brisbane `
I wish you the best compared to Sydney, my LabsNN in Sydney had __horrible__ ping times

[14-Apr-19 11:36 PM] phm87#7395
I'll make measures on the existing NN and on the known DC, thank you for your advices @kolo

[14-Apr-19 11:38 PM] kolo#1111
And not just ping. Seems there is no 100% net neutrality in such big distances

[14-Apr-19 11:38 PM] phm87#7395
this gives me food for brain, thank you kolo ^^

[14-Apr-19 11:39 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah genie my testnet ping is 0.28ms to nearly everyone. My aussie based pool also runs into dramas because of this. I will work with it and try to overcome these issues.

[14-Apr-19 11:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine for labs was like 310 😛

[14-Apr-19 11:41 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah, some DC in Aus arent the greatest. Theyre also stupid expensive

[14-Apr-19 11:42 PM] phm87#7395
ok I won't like : I didn't understand clearly how are defined regions and I'm still trying to understand what are the limits of SH region based on what I find on internet

[14-Apr-19 11:43 PM] phm87#7395
do you have a reliable source to define regions ?

[14-Apr-19 11:43 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
One place I was browsing offere an i7-7700k with 32gb ram and 1tb ssd eith 1tb data for $1300(AUD)/month

[14-Apr-19 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 I noticed that map has a discrepancy with Iceland compared to this one http://cryptocartography.io/notarymap/

Webby, surely african and south american SH nodes wont run into the same latency issues as AUS/NZ nodes

[14-Apr-19 11:44 PM] kolo#1111
@webworker01 I can only say komodoninja_EU is wrong

[14-Apr-19 11:44 PM] phm87#7395
I thought that kmd had another region for south america, I didn't know it was in SH region (no I am not 5 years old)

[14-Apr-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
SH is not literally southern hemisphere

[14-Apr-19 11:45 PM] kolo#1111
Im not so good in geography 😃 Need to google each case people doubt about

[14-Apr-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
@kolo Iceland?

[14-Apr-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it matters just curious

[14-Apr-19 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
one map says NA, the other EU

[14-Apr-19 11:46 PM] kolo#1111
Should be EU

[14-Apr-19 11:46 PM] kolo#1111
Im almost sure

[14-Apr-19 11:46 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if any DC exists in Iceland

[14-Apr-19 11:47 PM] Alright#0419
Can we make web's "official" I think it was made using the old "official" map

[14-Apr-19 11:47 PM] kolo#1111
It's geopolitical thing. Iceland is EU politically

[14-Apr-19 11:49 PM] kolo#1111
@Alright there will be 195 edge cases

[14-Apr-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
No there won't 😃

[14-Apr-19 11:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just 194

[14-Apr-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
working on it, should have a clear proposal for 2020 ruleset soon

[14-Apr-19 11:50 PM] kolo#1111
Who can tell me is Russia in Europe or in Asia? :troll_cool:

[14-Apr-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
It's in the Asia Russia region

[14-Apr-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
Clearly

[14-Apr-19 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
A*R*

[14-Apr-19 11:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Russia is in NA

[14-Apr-19 11:51 PM] kolo#1111
@Alright send it to me also so we can both work on that, if you want

[14-Apr-19 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
That's the plan

[14-Apr-19 11:51 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright  a new participant will be added in few hours : @Dr.Terminus  (he is syncing his kmd node and AC)

[14-Apr-19 11:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
😁

[14-Apr-19 11:52 PM] Alright#0419
~3pm UTC sound good?

[14-Apr-19 11:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
hi everyone

[14-Apr-19 11:52 PM] phm87#7395
Russia seems cut in half with a European part

[14-Apr-19 11:53 PM] kolo#1111
@phm87 than where is middle? I will be happy to know and tell others 😃

[14-Apr-19 11:53 PM] phm87#7395
half is a wrong word

[14-Apr-19 11:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm due to update notary cadidate map, will post link once done

[14-Apr-19 11:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might also add votegraph to oracle.earth

[14-Apr-19 11:54 PM] Alright#0419
If it's geopolitcal as kolo says, could we define the regions by country?

[14-Apr-19 11:54 PM] kolo#1111
@webworker01 you're missing small (and big) countries between us and european union.

[14-Apr-19 11:55 PM] phm87#7395
@kolo  I checked : I am wrong (I forgot on purpose the conflict in Ukraine and russian part + the very tiny part of land that belongs to russia because nobody cares about this so tiny thing)

[14-Apr-19 11:55 PM] kolo#1111
In political terms 100% no

[14-Apr-19 11:56 PM] phm87#7395
when guys presented me KMD, they told me that regions are defined with a very weird rule, they were not able to explain it in any language

[14-Apr-19 11:56 PM] kolo#1111
Target of regions is not ping sizes and mile distance, but rather political, so no local gov-t can ruin dpow network when disliking crypto

[14-Apr-19 11:57 PM] kolo#1111
politics cant be since defined 😦

[14-Apr-19 11:57 PM] phm87#7395
so if US nuke Russia, dpow willstill work then

[14-Apr-19 11:57 PM] phm87#7395
that's cool

[14-Apr-19 11:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it's geopolitcal:
France still owns islands in SA, shouldn't they be part of EU

[14-Apr-19 11:57 PM] kolo#1111
exactly (and also opposite works)

[14-Apr-19 11:58 PM] Alright#0419
really believe we should move away from regions as it's not easily enforceable

[14-Apr-19 11:58 PM] Alright#0419
nerf the ping advantage

[14-Apr-19 11:58 PM] Alright#0419
or find a better metric

[14-Apr-19 11:59 PM] Alright#0419
rather than pure counts

[14-Apr-19 11:59 PM] phm87#7395
As Africa is into SH, I'll compare pings in countries of Africa close to Europe, maybe it can help but unsure that it will be cryptofriendly

[14-Apr-19 11:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how to stop everyone from being on one DC?`

💥 

[14-Apr-19 11:59 PM] Alright#0419
uptime would be a good metric but also hard to enforce

[14-Apr-19 11:59 PM] Alright#0419
probably easily cheated

[15-Apr-19 12:00 AM] phm87#7395
but it can be more fair and it can help more SH region to be near other SH NN physically and have rapid links to european and asian nodes

[15-Apr-19 12:00 AM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 go for egypt so our nodes can be buds

I'm not sure that egypt is crypto friendly

☝🏻 

[15-Apr-19 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
US isn't either

[15-Apr-19 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
how many nodes are there?

[15-Apr-19 12:01 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They're crypt friendly ;)

[15-Apr-19 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
Australia previous PM asserts that the laws of mathematics don't apply there

[15-Apr-19 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
is that crypto friendly?

[15-Apr-19 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
Oh yep, nevermind 😂

[15-Apr-19 12:02 AM] phm87#7395
US have some laws that are crypto friendly (BitLicence for NY, laws for miners in some states and some states allows to pay taxes in cryptos, and i'm thinking about coinbase that it very friend with US govt I heard)

[15-Apr-19 12:03 AM] kolo#1111
@Alright node location is not enforcable at all, since there is no such thing in ip info. It's just company contacts

[15-Apr-19 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
yes 😃

[15-Apr-19 12:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i don't need to be fatwah'd`
because you got the 1st 1/2 nailed already? :troll:

[15-Apr-19 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
so let's figure a way to get rid of that unenforceable "rule"

[15-Apr-19 12:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
For the next election?

[15-Apr-19 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
it's more of a suggestion if you yourself even agree it's not enforceable

[15-Apr-19 12:04 AM] Alright#0419
Yes @NutellaLicka

[15-Apr-19 12:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
👍

[15-Apr-19 12:04 AM] kolo#1111
@webworker01 I used that triangulation once. My server in wardrobe apeared to be some k miles away

[15-Apr-19 12:05 AM] kolo#1111
@Alright in constant search of better method to actually distribute nodes. So far this method worked well.

[15-Apr-19 12:05 AM] Alright#0419
I completely disagree

[15-Apr-19 12:05 AM] kolo#1111
TOR is not an option

[15-Apr-19 12:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is too lazy to install tor_

[15-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Alright#0419
You may have decentralized the location of nodes, but you centralized the ruleset to a group of people determining which nodes are region cheating and which have exceptions

{Reactions}
👆🏽 

[15-Apr-19 12:07 AM] kolo#1111
Dont touch those old exceptions

[15-Apr-19 12:07 AM] kolo#1111
You will see following year if those will happen (and why) or hopefully no

[15-Apr-19 12:08 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I need to wait until the initial komodo blockchain finishes syncing before assetchains will be synced ?

[15-Apr-19 12:08 AM] kolo#1111
They are technical, not geopolitical

[15-Apr-19 12:08 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
bootstrap them all to happen / sync at once / faster ?

{Reactions}

[15-Apr-19 12:08 AM] phm87#7395
@Dr.Terminus  KMD and AC are not linked, you can can start each one individually

[15-Apr-19 12:09 AM] kolo#1111
ACs actually verify notarizations in KMD if in notary mode

[15-Apr-19 12:09 AM] Alright#0419
The 4 dev nodes should be the exception to no exceptions IMO

[15-Apr-19 12:13 AM] kolo#1111
Should not be a problem with exceptions this year. This year I have whom to ask for solutions to all possible edge cases.
