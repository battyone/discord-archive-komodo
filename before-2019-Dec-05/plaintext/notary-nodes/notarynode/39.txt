I read that too,  no Z vote.  I think it was James or ca333.  But the post isn't showing up...

[06-Mar-19 11:01 PM] Ludom#5832
I want to see funny business with people who sell vote token. It's a work for barterlly @Deleted User

[06-Mar-19 11:02 PM] Ludom#5832
I want to see exchanges that vote for themself  with their deposit

[06-Mar-19 11:04 PM] Ludom#5832
I hope for a big participation to show that people are interested in Komodo

[06-Mar-19 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe not a good idea to add it on barterlly

[06-Mar-19 11:04 PM] Ludom#5832
Why ?

[06-Mar-19 11:05 PM] Ludom#5832
If you don't do that, other people will do that

[06-Mar-19 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
not a problem for me

[06-Mar-19 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
but it s not my call

@kolo

[06-Mar-19 11:06 PM] Ludom#5832
Anyway last year some people made financial arrangements to support some notaries

[06-Mar-19 11:07 PM] Ludom#5832
We need to continue the Komodo exprience

[06-Mar-19 11:08 PM] Ludom#5832
I want a great show üçø

[06-Mar-19 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
anyway it's technically not a problem at all, it's just that those vote tokens are supposed to die after the election

[06-Mar-19 11:10 PM] kolo#1111
It‚Äôs total freedom. I only see transparent balance of address at the end. No participation or digging how votes got there

[06-Mar-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
wouldn t understand that people want to trade them

[06-Mar-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
but if you want it

[06-Mar-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
you'll get it, I just want to stay friendly with everyone

[06-Mar-19 11:10 PM] kolo#1111
If someone wants to sell votes - it‚Äôs up to other voters how to treat such buyer

[06-Mar-19 11:10 PM] kolo#1111
All is transparent

[06-Mar-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
but that s my promise : all AC are eligible in a matter of minutes to be added

[06-Mar-19 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok @kolo

[06-Mar-19 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
can't be more clear

[06-Mar-19 11:11 PM] Ludom#5832
@Deleted User Depend the price of the votes, it can be lucrative for both side

[06-Mar-19 11:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not sure how to feel about this

[06-Mar-19 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s just politics

[06-Mar-19 11:12 PM] kolo#1111
Original source of votes (me) won‚Äôt sell them obliviously

[06-Mar-19 11:12 PM] Ludom#5832
And I'm very interested in the price of 1 vote

[06-Mar-19 11:12 PM] Ludom#5832
That's an experiment

[06-Mar-19 11:12 PM] Ludom#5832
I nether buy any vote

[06-Mar-19 11:12 PM] kolo#1111
And don‚Äôt promote candidates doing that. But just can‚Äôt prohibit technically

[06-Mar-19 11:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Makes me not excited to participate TBH
Didn't realize it was something that was possible.
Assumed votes were single transaction.

[06-Mar-19 11:13 PM] kolo#1111
It will be useless time consuming hide and seek game

[06-Mar-19 11:13 PM] Ludom#5832
But if one notary could be elected with bought vote token, it'll be interesting

[06-Mar-19 11:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I am expecting to put a lot of time and effort into the campaign and election and that includes money.

[06-Mar-19 11:13 PM] kolo#1111
@FishyGuts anonymity and decentralization comes with its own prices and cons

[06-Mar-19 11:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not as interested if it's possible to game the system in the above fashion.

[06-Mar-19 11:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If it is someone said something, just avoid it. Confirm your source of information from official source of information, which must be a written document explaining all things need to be clear to Notary Nodes.

[06-Mar-19 11:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
let's airdrop VOTETRADE to see if people want to support the trading :troll:

[06-Mar-19 11:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I like Githib.io web page for such thing

[06-Mar-19 11:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@kolo I suggest to make a website on Github.io

[06-Mar-19 11:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And avoid any Wordpress websites for Notary Nodes, which encourages centralization

[06-Mar-19 11:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Audo

[06-Mar-19 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw as of now, am neutral about this, I just know kolo isn't opposed to.

[06-Mar-19 11:16 PM] kolo#1111
I will do exactly that, but marketing team wants some website movement. Let them do that

[06-Mar-19 11:16 PM] kolo#1111
@grewalsatinder

[06-Mar-19 11:17 PM] kolo#1111
They feel absolutely happy creating webforms and posts. Why to prohibit them doing it ;))

[06-Mar-19 11:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I disagree with Komodo Marketing team If they want a centralized website for Notary Nodes Elections PR

[06-Mar-19 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Take a static HTML template from Themeforest, and host it on Githib.io

[06-Mar-19 11:18 PM] kolo#1111
Consider it non official addition to elections üòâ

[06-Mar-19 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Edit it

[06-Mar-19 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And let all other Notary OP contribute to that webaite edits too

[06-Mar-19 11:19 PM] kolo#1111
It‚Äôs essential for outter world and newbies. Not for us or our mature candidates

[06-Mar-19 11:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This takes the wind out of my sails to a considerable degree.  We will review the system, last years results and public sentiment regarding it.  

Thanks for bringing attention to the fact that Vote buying is possible.

[06-Mar-19 11:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Even as a pirate, I find that rather distasteful.

[06-Mar-19 11:19 PM] kolo#1111
I announced where all nodes should have page. That‚Äôs must. Website PR is upon marketing team as nifty bonus on top of that. Not centralized candidates source

[06-Mar-19 11:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@kolo My view is not stoping Marketing, it is making them use as much possible decentralization friendly processes as possible

[06-Mar-19 11:20 PM] kolo#1111
@FishyGuts we bring it each year. But you can‚Äôt technically limit how voter and candidates came to agreement

[06-Mar-19 11:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And so far I don't see wordpress a decentralized solution

[06-Mar-19 11:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can push update to girhub, have to ask wordpress admin for edits

[06-Mar-19 11:21 PM] kolo#1111
@grewalsatinder since process is decentralized - team website acts as a participant, addition, not official source or master

[06-Mar-19 11:22 PM] kolo#1111
Anyone is free to make any websites )))

[06-Mar-19 11:22 PM] kolo#1111
Think of it this way

[06-Mar-19 11:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay I will comment after I see a website then

[06-Mar-19 11:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
üôÇ

[06-Mar-19 11:25 PM] Alright#0419
@kolo maybe not worth the effort, just floating the idea. Maybe we could do something like http://oracle.earth/ ?

[06-Mar-19 11:25 PM] Alright#0419
instead of git, have proposals on chain in oracles

[06-Mar-19 11:25 PM] Alright#0419
only real reason to do this would be to show off oracle tech I guess

[06-Mar-19 11:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@kolo I guess under the current airdrop system there isn't a way to stop "Voter and candidate agreements" aka... vote buying.  
I don't know enough about Blockchain coding to even suggest an alternative and I assume someone would have already done so if one were available.
I have already spent about .25 BTC on costs I'll never see back so we will run as hard as we can, but this is not very ideal from any standpoint, and other than "following the code" arguments, I don't see how anyone could agree with the morals of it.
Perhaps this is a dead horse but this is only my first time around.
Thanks for bringing it up.  We will proceed accordingly.

[06-Mar-19 11:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I assume that it's possible that way, but I don't know enough about coding, and I am not trying to give anyone a bunch of extra work for this just because I don't agree with it.

[06-Mar-19 11:27 PM] Alright#0419
@FishyGuts are you saying you want to disqualify people who buy VOTE or strike deals with whales?

[06-Mar-19 11:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No

[06-Mar-19 11:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I am saying I dislike the practice and the idea of it, vote buying.

[06-Mar-19 11:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Seems fishy, *no relation*

[06-Mar-19 11:29 PM] Alright#0419
I don't see much difference in saying "x% of my KMD rewards will go to y" and saying "x% of my KMD rewards will go to you if you vote for me"

[06-Mar-19 11:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As anything in life... arguing both sides of a topic is possible ad infinitum.

[06-Mar-19 11:30 PM] SHossain#0007
@FishyGuts even if people don't buy and sell publicly, they can always make arrangement with whales or other voters via DM or different means.

[06-Mar-19 11:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One runs on a platform to support the ecosystem and other projects.  The other supports the Notary node and the vote seller at the outset with no need to follow through on campaign promises.

[06-Mar-19 11:31 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no way to stop this

[06-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
almost as if that's what everyone does ü§£

[06-Mar-19 11:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I know @SHossain

[06-Mar-19 11:31 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright a lot of ops including me didn't buy votes on the last election

[06-Mar-19 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
we solely relied on votes from KMD holders

[06-Mar-19 11:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Theoretically, I can spend up to 10,000 KMD+  buying "Valueless" votes from lowball sellers to secure a node and still come out smelling good.
That does ZERO for KMD.
I won't encourage it for Pirate voters and I hope its not something everyone is doing.

[06-Mar-19 11:33 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain I imagine you talked some people into voting to you in DM

[06-Mar-19 11:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Talking people into votes is campaigning.

[06-Mar-19 11:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Buying VoteTokens is different.

[06-Mar-19 11:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"Hey I'll give you 1KMD per xxx vote tokens.  They're useless anyway"

[06-Mar-19 11:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"No value so you should sell them to me.
At least you will increase your KMD stack by 1-5% immediately."

[06-Mar-19 11:34 PM] SHossain#0007
> @SHossain I imagine you talked some people into voting to you in DM
nope, everything was public

[06-Mar-19 11:34 PM] SHossain#0007
all posts in slack and forum

[06-Mar-19 11:35 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...and i participated in the testnet from where i received bounty like other candidates

[06-Mar-19 11:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I'll stop being a whiner now, My position is clear :P
Strengthening the ecosystem through notary rewards is Pirates goal and that's how we will earn our votes üòÉ

how many spots are you running for this year @SHossain

[06-Mar-19 11:36 PM] Alright#0419
what's the deal with the "AR" dev node is what I'm wondering

[06-Mar-19 11:36 PM] NNoperator#3835
IIRC the vote chain was looked over for multiple transactions for given UTXOs and very little were found
