i thought genie was in all 4 regions?

[11-Apr-19 07:10 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
He may be physically/mentally, but it looks like they are running for just 1 NN?

[11-Apr-19 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I was running for 3, but dropped to 1 because of how many were running

Could you guys help @Mylo with http://komodoelection.com and have that candidate list by region there?

the http://komodoelection.com site is hosted through Github (uses Jekyll). Anyone can take a look and issue pull requests that help improve the site.

https://komodoelection.com/candidates/ <- this page should list candidates by region, but there's some problem

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/lumberscout - seems he wants to be a candidate in all regions `SH/EU/NA/AR`, but provide only one address. Not clear how to count this.

Should be 1 address per region ... otherwise, it's not clear how to count votes in case of win.

[11-Apr-19 07:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
did he get is test node running yet?

not that it matters for that conversation, was just curious

For next year, LABS will be a great place for newbies to start with

[11-Apr-19 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
for sure NN needs dedicated, capable and reliable ops

[11-Apr-19 07:54 PM] zatJUM#9924
It depends... I'm running in testnet with a crappy vps (my kmdlabs node is much better!)

[11-Apr-19 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
i mentioned the beginning of this testnet. if you want to show your performance and that you are capable use a better node.
also, kolo may reward the participants based on the performance.
another thing is, it is indeed a good test for your future server that you finally want to use if you get elected. you will find out easily if there is any issue or not.

[11-Apr-19 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
trust me, you don't want to change server quite often in the mainnet

[11-Apr-19 07:58 PM] zatJUM#9924
I believe you, but I don't want to spend 300$/month for a server if I'm not elected

[11-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s like poker :troll:

[11-Apr-19 07:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its a chance you need to take

[11-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw this testnet seems quite fun with attacks etc

[11-Apr-19 07:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
well, but spending 300$ for a month before the election may give you more chance to get elected

[11-Apr-19 08:00 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm 15th of the competition (I entered 19th), with a 15$ vps I was using for other services

[11-Apr-19 08:00 PM] SHossain#0007
if you spend $300 and show good performance you have more chance to get votes

[11-Apr-19 08:00 PM] SHossain#0007
just think it that way 游땎

[11-Apr-19 08:00 PM] SHossain#0007
if your performance is poor, what voters may think.

[11-Apr-19 08:01 PM] zatJUM#9924
I think it's not poor by entering 19th and being 15th with a crappy vps 游땎

[11-Apr-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe they can think he did good on labs and as he s not cresus he had to get the better of it with a crappy vps

I doubt it, my test server is $40, the other $260 is just pissing away $ if you do that

[11-Apr-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
don't need to have $300 server. i just replied with the amount he posted

[11-Apr-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use less for a good server

[11-Apr-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007

testnet is a bit different as you have to restart quite often. it s not a longrun but a sysadmin rush to fix and get back to work

[11-Apr-19 08:17 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It proves people are capable of doing the job

[11-Apr-19 08:18 PM] cipi#4502
the most important thing is network connectivity... problem is, that you don't know how good the hoster is beforehand, because most of them don't make their peering partners and network infrastructure public, so you will have to try it out...
i found a very good method to do it, but it takes 1 month till you have the result... and that is: run a tor relay and look what the "advertised bandwith" is after 1 month

[11-Apr-19 08:19 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
On that note. Having a node in Australia when everyone else is in the northern hemisphere hurts.

[11-Apr-19 08:21 PM] cipi#4502
yes, that is a problem... exactly the problem i have with my AR-node that is located in HongKong... it hardly made it to 7th place last season... my other node (Dallas, USA) is second and the hardware is very similar, even the hoster is the same
