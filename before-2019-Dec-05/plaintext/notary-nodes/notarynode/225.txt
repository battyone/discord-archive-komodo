Querying DNS seeds too frequently ¬∑ Issue #15434 ¬∑ bitcoin/bitcoin

is your seednode launched with -maxpeers=800

[22-Oct-19 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c nope, that sounds like good advice I somehow missed

[22-Oct-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
even a single node should be able to handle hundreds of peers, but if not set, it will limit to a very small number

[22-Oct-19 04:49 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you increased to 16 from 8 few hard updates ago

[22-Oct-19 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo what code do your DNS seeds run?

[22-Oct-19 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I cannot find a komodo-seeder on github

[22-Oct-19 05:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am updating https://github.com/MyHush/hush-seeder

[22-Oct-19 05:51 PM] kolo#1111
It‚Äôs not seeder, it‚Äôs a static dns record

[22-Oct-19 05:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
but i want to look at the diff between them

[22-Oct-19 05:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
so KMD is not running something like hush-seeder above?

[22-Oct-19 05:51 PM] kolo#1111
You can create seeder and add its host.

[22-Oct-19 05:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
so it's a static dns seed?

[22-Oct-19 05:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
or just a plain dns server?

[22-Oct-19 05:52 PM] kolo#1111
I did it once, but all DC I know ban crawlers like this

[22-Oct-19 05:52 PM] kolo#1111
It‚Äôs a he.net dns server and NN ip s

[22-Oct-19 05:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
I didn't realize KMD diverged this much in how DNS seeds work, in production. Good to know

[22-Oct-19 05:54 PM] kolo#1111
We can have both static list (due to having NN network it‚Äôs easy) and crawler seeds. Later is outside of NN scope, just nodes crawler

[22-Oct-19 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
SAFE forked the old hush-seeder, i guess i will look at their code to see what they did. it makes sense why they forked the old hush-seeder, if no komodo-seeder existed

[22-Oct-19 05:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
hush-seeder was forked from zcash-seeder, so that is how most BTC/ZEC coins do things, just inherited from btc core

[22-Oct-19 05:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not wrong to do something different, i just didn't know

[22-Oct-19 05:56 PM] kolo#1111
It is bc of notary nodes. They don‚Äôt have permanent network of known nodes like we do so they need crawler/seeder.

[22-Oct-19 05:57 PM] kolo#1111
I believe NN will seed hush also well, shouldn‚Äôt be a problem as long as HUSH won‚Äôt crash so often

[22-Oct-19 05:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo yes, it would be nice if HUSH would crash less often

[22-Oct-19 06:00 PM] kolo#1111
I mean changing DNS seeds won‚Äôt solve this üòï

[22-Oct-19 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo hush will be running it's own actual DNS seeds soon and that will help the situation greatly. If you are talking about the core KMD bug that made hushd coredump at block 99973, that has been fixed

[23-Oct-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i have to commend @phm87 for porting aPoW to CHIPS, i basically only pointed out one issue with his port and he got it all the way to working, even with a  height activation. he is on his way to becoming a core dev. this is a path open to anybody, but few venture onto it

I have a very weird behavior about chips and dpow, I don't know if anybody have the same problem. I though it was due to my apow changes but I had the problems on new fresh nodes synced without apow. Do you know why notarized count is way below the blocks count ?
```  "chain": "main",
  "blocks": 4876620,
  "headers": 4876620,
  "bestblockhash": "000000000000be8271f683e86e00ed0c2670a0e9ea585a6c80a8425e75514bb7",
  "notarizedhash": "000000000001094bc5a31d3462084e7e3dad049fb43c838bf535e4f21d5aceca",
  "notarizedtxid": "2364cdf9a9fcfcdadf71934eee40e05b444bb2aa86f9ef5b5d1817df0482e020",
  "notarized": 4173500,
  "prevMoMheight": 4173500,``` 700k blocks is not nothing. I tried to reindex, delete notarizations file and restart but it didn't help. I deleted the whole content of .chips folder (except wallet.dat and chips.conf) but I had the same result. btw, I don't have this behavior of my NN Chips node nor on some on my test nodes
Do you have any idea why I have this behavior ?

[28-Oct-19 10:11 AM] phm87#7395
<https://github.com/phm87/chips3/blob/apow/src/komodo_validation015.h#L82>
``static const int32_t KMD_SEASON_HEIGHTS[NUM_KMD_SEASONS] = {0, 4173578, 999999999};``
I think that 4173500 is the last nota of season2. I don't know why a fresh sync doesn't take into account s3 notas

[28-Oct-19 10:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
May seem obvious, but have you updated Komodo?

[28-Oct-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@phm87  that is correct... its a little unintuitive yes... The height/timestamp is when a season ends... That is why the third one is set years into the future.

[28-Oct-19 10:29 AM] phm87#7395
@NutellaLicka  sorry I am not very clear : I synced a new chips node with jl777/chips3 repo (master branch). There is no komodo running here. I don't know why my getinfo differs from the normal behavior. My issue is not a my NN
@blackjok3r  yes I agree. As 4173578 was the end of season 2, I wonder why the notarized field 4173500 in my getinfo is the last block notarized by s2. Maybe it is a special case for initial download

[28-Oct-19 10:29 AM] phm87#7395
```  "blocks": 4876620,
  "headers": 4876620,

  "notarized": 4173500,

[28-Oct-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt be the case.

[28-Oct-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is it running with or witout txindex=1?

[28-Oct-19 10:33 AM] phm87#7395
I don't have this behavior on my mainet 3P NN for chips and NutellaLicka doesn't have this behavior either. without txindex

[28-Oct-19 10:33 AM] phm87#7395
but I won't lie : most of my chips nodes have txindex (and no pbs)

[28-Oct-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
without.. np that goes down a diffrenet path, I dont think its totally supported...

[28-Oct-19 10:34 AM] phm87#7395
ok I'll try with txindex, thank you buddy

[28-Oct-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
txindex and reindex will fix it üôÇ

[28-Oct-19 10:34 AM] phm87#7395
ok thank you. But is it an issue related to all 3P coins and all SC ?

[28-Oct-19 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt be all of them no.. The wallet code in them all is diffrent... Some work fine, CHIPS did, so maybe its a bug. A few others I remever run txindex aby defualt like KMD, so didnt need the watchonly path for notary keys.

[28-Oct-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
support for txindex=0 wasnt added until GAME, which was after CHIPS

[28-Oct-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I;m pretty sure I added it to CHIPs at the hard fork and it was working.

[28-Oct-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems that its onyl half works..

[28-Oct-19 10:41 AM] phm87#7395
thank you guys for the explanations, I will have a deeper look later to fix behavior without txindex. I'll compare Game and Chips. Right now, I just need running nodes, I don't need to test without txindex. About my problem, maybe I misconfigured sth so don't loose time on this.
Thank you again for your help

as I have troubles with reindex, I'll try to delete blockchain and download it again with txindex enabled. I had troubles in the past, with reindex to change txindex from 0 to 1 (I was never able to do it on Chips). With a fresh sync with txindex, it should work

reindex + txindex changing does not work reliably all the time, just txindex changing doesn't work reliably all the time. If you change the setting of txindex, delete the datadir

yes, there is code to deal with this stuff, and if you want to find the bugs lurking there, be our guest

[07-Nov-19 01:09 AM] gcharang#6833
is this true for all BTC forks or just KMD? @dukeleto

[07-Nov-19 03:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang it's hard to say exactly which versions of which forks have it. BTC core does not have this problem, but I am not sure if it's a bug in all/most zcash forks or a kmd-specific bug

[07-Nov-19 05:57 AM] gcharang#6833
got it. I was wondering if it was caused by our particular reliance on txindex for dPoW

[08-Nov-19 02:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
dpow does not rely on txindex=1

[08-Nov-19 07:32 AM] gcharang#6833
then, why do all smart chains have txindex=1 in their confs by default?

[08-Nov-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
CC needs txindex

[08-Nov-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
rewards needs txindex

[08-Nov-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
dpow needs txindex for efficient method, external chains have implemented txindex=0 support for this, but since txindex is always there for komodo chains, it uses the more efficient method

[08-Nov-19 10:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
It would be possible to make txindex=0 work on smart chains without CCs and still have dpow, but nobody has wanted to do that, I guess

[08-Nov-19 12:07 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry for the late reply. I have no pb with txindex=1. Joker explained me that the bug related to txindex=0 on chips is fixed on gamecredits. I will create an issue on github with the infos.
So now I test apow only with txindex set

[08-Nov-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
its more an unimplemented feature than a bug

[08-Nov-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, allowing txindex=0 on a 3rd party coin with DPoW did not exist at first, and then the method of watching all 64 notary node addresses was implemented by James. When talking with potential new DPoW coins, one of the first things I ask them is if txindex=1 by default in their coin, or if they support it. GIN, for instance, requires txindex=1, so I didn't implement the txindex=0 codepath in GIN. It saves time in integrating the code as well as testing full syncs

Someone tried to use an HSM with Komodo notary ?

[18-Nov-19 11:13 PM] phm87#7395
now, iguana is uging signrawtransaction rpc calls. So whatever we put something into an HSM, if an attacker can take control of the notary node, if attacker can use signrawtransaction, he can sign any tx he wants. I don't think that HSM allows such rpc calls. I think that many huges deep changes into iguana should be performed to be able to use an HSM into Komodo notary. We can give a try later (if jl and ledger or trezor agree)
