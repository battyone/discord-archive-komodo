So even with a prod node i am under 30gb used

[16-Aug-18 03:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
ahh yeah

[16-Aug-18 03:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
sorry

[16-Aug-18 03:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
just checked

[16-Aug-18 03:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
iguana does take quite a bit

[16-Aug-18 03:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
but still

[16-Aug-18 03:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
do think the entire UTXO set is stored in RAM for each coin daemon

[16-Aug-18 03:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, iguana uses more

will show all daemons and iguana in order of memory usage

[16-Aug-18 03:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c why is iguana memory usage so high?

[16-Aug-18 03:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
is it storing the UTXO set for all coins internally or something?

[16-Aug-18 03:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
or maybe loading latest blocks for all chains into memory or something?

[16-Aug-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810

It was said stay updated on dev branch. That's what I'm doing. I cannot decide what to update and what not. That's for the repo master to decide

If the higher ups push me a commit I'm going to update to it in time

@lukechilds I agree with being stable but as mentioned read above

If the team decides it's best to test bleeding edge code on critical infrastructure it's their decision I'm just following guidelines

good afternoon, we have some issues with our SH node that after some weeks testing I think its worth sharing with the community to try to find a solution

{Reactions}
üëç 

[17-Aug-18 11:31 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
our AR node is doing good, both @experimenter and @molody(Pungoio)  have been working last weeks to make sure everything runs fine. AR node is on good top positions as it should be given the time they are putting into it. We are not probably the most advanced and skilled people in the community but we have been putting a lot of hours to try to make sure we deliver a good service for NN

On the other hand, SH node, for reasons we have not been able to understand, its not working as expected. I know there has been conversations with decker and other team members, but I can say we have been trying almost everything during last 3 months. We have been into 5 different hosting providers, some of them which are into the world top ones. We have tried OVH, Vultr and AWS and 2 other smaller ones. The results have been the same. The reason cannot be the ping. We have been metering carefully new providers. I have in mind that it might be related with the Node IP being not fully whitelisted by the rest of nodes or by something related to a password into a config file that was replaced long time ago when we started operating. Both Molody and experimenter has more details on it

The thing is, in order to have notary nodes working as expected we need some support to make sure this node works into notary node network, as from infrastructure side we have been making everything in our hands last months and the proof is that AR node is on top.

[17-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000

are you stuck on the wrong chain?

[19-Aug-18 02:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
Check the last blockhash you have with explorer you might already be on the wrong chain

Also need to check that latest master VRSC is used. If node running old - it will not sync.

[19-Aug-18 02:48 PM] infotech-al#5583
might be stuck

[19-Aug-18 02:49 PM] Decker#3767
@infotech-al show your `./komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getinfo` here ...

[19-Aug-18 02:49 PM] infotech-al#5583
