I've been looking at upgrades. using 500gb / 64gb at the moment, but looks like 1TB / 192gb is only about 20% more.

[17-May-19 11:39 AM] jorian#4555
192 gb ram?

will need to upgrade hdds. I was looking to do that on current node, then this caught my eye.

[17-May-19 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
no offense

[17-May-19 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
but I believe we will have to split servers

[17-May-19 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think we need clarifications on the setup

[17-May-19 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
but if I understood right

[17-May-19 11:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
we will have double setup possible

[17-May-19 11:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
so.. is the current setup documentation not applicable then?! 🤔

[17-May-19 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
I wouldn t order before knowing the answer personnally

[17-May-19 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
I m not claiming anything

[17-May-19 11:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
too late :abusedsmily:

[17-May-19 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just that depending on the answer

[17-May-19 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
things may change

[17-May-19 11:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
well, that's unfortunate

[17-May-19 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
I barely have the time to keep up on Barterlly, but here I have a doubt

[17-May-19 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
and won't go further before it s clear

[17-May-19 11:46 AM] mrlynch#5735
@kolo 👆 can you share some info on that?

[17-May-19 11:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Two iguana network can run on same machine with 2 different public IP pointing two it.

[17-May-19 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
efficiency ?

[17-May-19 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
price ratio ?

[17-May-19 11:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So of that what u mean by split I thknk that a answers it?

[17-May-19 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
why do we need beefy 128 where double setup with NVME can be achieved for everyone with 30% cost less ?

[17-May-19 11:47 AM] kolo#1111
Current specs are good to work for now. Probably year will be ok

[17-May-19 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
2 iguana network will be 2 independent servers here

[17-May-19 11:47 AM] kolo#1111
64gb works well. Only SSD might need upgrade same moment

[17-May-19 11:48 AM] mrlynch#5735
so are we going to have 2 networks or 1? if i follow the current nn documentation is that ok?

[17-May-19 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
I just see people giving me specs of 128 and 256 gb

[17-May-19 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s useless

[17-May-19 11:48 AM] kolo#1111
Yet one

[17-May-19 11:48 AM] mrlynch#5735
so the new mainnet will start with just 1 and potentially split down the line?

[17-May-19 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
splitting means offloading can be done, and optimizing both costs and performance

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] mrlynch#5735
why 2 pubkeys then?

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Scaling

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Clustering, maybe...🤔

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
yet, the "whatif" just makes me warn people : don t rent a beefy serv, if we may need a second one in the year

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch current doc will be updated when we have more detailed info on how to use 2 iguana network. full info is not available yet. current doc is good for current ops.

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Whatever word maks one happy

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
trivial : 1 iguana per serv

[17-May-19 11:49 AM] mrlynch#5735
if scaling is needed that's fine with 1 beefy server as well as it can be virtualized, unless that's inefficient

shexy 

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] SHossain#0007
it will be updated during the next season launch or before

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
it will be efficient

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
but if you think bare

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
it won t

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
`it will be updated during the next season launch or before` is that 2020?

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] kolo#1111
Second network info is not yet ready.

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
but in the pipe

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also agree with dwy, ideal would be 1 iguana on a server in my opinion too, I just wanted to Express possible setup on same machine

[17-May-19 11:50 AM] kolo#1111
When it will be ready - manuals will be too

[17-May-19 11:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s just a friendly advice for people not to waste money

[17-May-19 11:51 AM] SHossain#0007
`is that 2020?`
first week of July 2019

[17-May-19 11:51 AM] SHossain#0007
no one said that next season will launch next year

[17-May-19 11:51 AM] Strob#3417
Well if I have my server at home it's better on 1 server.

[17-May-19 11:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
hold.. i was told to have servers ready by 1st june

[17-May-19 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
I just say

[17-May-19 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
don t get cocky with a 256

[17-May-19 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
if we have to split half year

[17-May-19 11:52 AM] mrlynch#5735
if i buy and deploy servers by 1st june for 1 network and then have to change to 2 networks a heads up would be good

[17-May-19 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
I believe it s not ready

[17-May-19 11:52 AM] SHossain#0007
1st of June, we start testing of new source for mainnet for 2 weeks. we update all pools, exchanges, service providers, wallets, explorers after mid June. July mainnet update goes live

🙏 

[17-May-19 11:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
but to be efficient you have to prepare to what s next

[17-May-19 11:53 AM] mrlynch#5735
`but if you think bare` instead of getting 2 servs for 300 each i'd rather get 1 for 500 and virtualize it, diff ip's and all

[17-May-19 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
if your prices are like that, as you wish

[17-May-19 11:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
everyone need to play with all cards in hand

[17-May-19 11:54 AM] mrlynch#5735
those are kinda my options.. i'm open to options and education.. i don't know what to expect, haven't done this befor3... all i know is i don't wanna fekk up

[17-May-19 11:54 AM] mrlynch#5735
so 1  june - 15 june -> mainnet test

[17-May-19 11:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
again, I m not claiming anything

[17-May-19 11:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't think there is skme kinda restrictions mate, explore, experience and adopt as need arise. Risk is also good sometimes.

[17-May-19 11:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
just knowing 2 diff networks

[17-May-19 11:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
makes me optimize on every part

[17-May-19 11:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
cost is a part

[17-May-19 11:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
risk might be good sometimes, when you already know a fair bit

[17-May-19 11:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
so, i should expect and plan to deploy new servers after 15 june?!

[17-May-19 11:56 AM] SHossain#0007
but, for NN Next Season info Kolo is the best person to announce.

[17-May-19 11:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
in case 2 networks will be a thing?

[17-May-19 11:56 AM] SHossain#0007
the info i have given is for Komodo source

[17-May-19 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s just a friendly reminder that we will have infrastructure change that may be needed

[17-May-19 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
and if people go for a 256

[17-May-19 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
256GB RAM is overkill

[17-May-19 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
and have to popup a new serv for whatever reason

[17-May-19 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes

[17-May-19 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
128 is more than enough

[17-May-19 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
but, if anyone wants to have 256GB RAM, there is no issue

[17-May-19 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
it's their personal choice
