@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator any reason why you add more nodes what I have?

cant hurt to have a few bonus addnodes 😉

yeah, I'm not using most of that json tbh, but set it up for later

assetchains.json was the best addittion to the notary repo all year... it made LABS possible to be made.

[01-Apr-19 01:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been working on makking gps kit smaller. battery is still an issue tho, and kinetic charging  doesnt scale down well unless the cat moves really, really fast

[01-Apr-19 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Light, too.

[01-Apr-19 01:28 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically for the kinetic charger to work optimally, the cat has to vibrate at frquency that leads to interdimensional shifting, and then the GPS signal is lost.

minsig 7 for 20 nodes is too much if you compare with mainnet numbers.

more sigs is better... just need everyone to update

`Ok it's not like he went on github and added his name everywhere until it appears in the prints! `
Actually, he kinda does :P
when he edits stuff he adds `[Decker]` prints so that he can easily pick them out 
some times he "forgets" to remove it or comment it out

it's a silly Problem with a join If you did not notarize within that period on one chain it does not show it instead of 0
