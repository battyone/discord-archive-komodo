I have UTXOs set as 50, check every 10 mins on cron, if they're lower than 25, split the delta

[31-Jul-18 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
and mined utxos are automatically consolidated

[31-Jul-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems a decent way..

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
so I never have more than 50

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine send out at 12, so the cld storage gets rewards

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
max of 3 conbase UTXO in wallet at once.

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probablly need to recuce KMD more and split more often

[31-Jul-18 11:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
I was considering tweaking it crazy low, try and keep it around 10

[31-Jul-18 11:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I don't see how searching through 10 UTXOs can be much faster than 50

thats dangerous with this many blocks being spammed at the moment

[31-Jul-18 11:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah maybe not 10

[31-Jul-18 11:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I think 50-25 is a nice amount

[31-Jul-18 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I split uner 77, 77  lol seemed a decent muber to use

[31-Jul-18 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once an hour. AC 10/10 each hour

[31-Jul-18 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it might require more tweaks now everyone else is doing it

[31-Jul-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well clearly not everyone... its about half the notaries... the other half dont even work any more :trollface:

[31-Jul-18 11:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
haha

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
I just check everything in the same script and only split what's needed

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well they said to get auto elected you needed to get more notarizations... so thats what I did

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i do BTC seperate each 6H

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue of mempool

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
from my logs ‚òù

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mines much the same

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
that runs every 10 mins

[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC doesnt seem to make any diff at all... its only here to broadcast the TX and check the notarizations on sync of KMD

[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
the code just loops over everything

[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
easier to leave it the same than change it

[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
I jsut tweak it for KMD

[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if BTC splits and it has t conformed... it will split and split...

[31-Jul-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you check the mempoll for hte last split.

[31-Jul-18 11:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
I did consider that actually, I thought iguana wouldn't let that happen

[31-Jul-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess if you just have 1 utxo, it cant split until confirm though ü§î

[31-Jul-18 11:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
you get an error about can't duplcate split

[31-Jul-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
youwill get isue when funded with more BTC though

[31-Jul-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will split 2 times.

[31-Jul-18 11:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
why?

[31-Jul-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if BTC has no blocks for 45mins... and you have 2 utxo's

[31-Jul-18 11:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
it will start splitting when I'm down to 25 UTXOs

[31-Jul-18 11:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it should run fine for a while

[31-Jul-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will split the first... then before the first is confirmed, it will check and still be under 25 adn split the other utxo

[31-Jul-18 11:30 AM] Mylo#8306
easier to read than logs üòÉ

I tried to count TX in mempool for this, but simply splitting btc every 6H seemed a simpler approach

[31-Jul-18 11:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
KMD splits about every 40 mins

[31-Jul-18 11:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
so could probs just reduce my cron interval a bit

[31-Jul-18 11:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
maybe 30 mins

[31-Jul-18 11:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
the chance of getting a 30 mins BTC block on the exact same time I need to split is pretty low

[31-Jul-18 11:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
so should be ok

[31-Jul-18 11:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
assuming splitfunds uses a good txfee

[31-Jul-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just put BTC on a seperate cron... you can have liek 500 BTC utxo and it wont make any diffrence

[31-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Mylo#8306
i do it 1 per hour.  threshold 50, split 77.  but might raise threshold with AC mining going hectic

[31-Jul-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested this

[31-Jul-18 11:37 AM] Mylo#8306
i manually split btc, 150 per week if needed

[31-Jul-18 11:37 AM] Mylo#8306
m.a.n.u.a.l.l.y.

[31-Jul-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[31-Jul-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you could just split the entire 1 BTC you get sent when it arrives

[31-Jul-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would still be ok

[31-Jul-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL

[31-Jul-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
makes NO diffrence at all.

[31-Jul-18 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the optimization comes from the coins being notarized to BTC... so KMD needs optimize to notarize to BTC.... and AC need optimize to notarize to KMD

[31-Jul-18 11:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
but doesn't the block header get notarised to BTC

[31-Jul-18 11:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
then the BTC TXID back to KMD?

[31-Jul-18 11:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
just an assumption, I don't actually know how it works

[31-Jul-18 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was confused at first of this too, as the KMD hash is broadcast to BTC first, if that goes through then the txid of that tx gets notarized into KMD

[31-Jul-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the optimizations seem to work in reverse of this

[31-Jul-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to repond faster in building the hash thats sent to BTC but the BTC transaction itself is not important in speed

[31-Jul-18 11:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
but don't 13 notarys need to sign the BTC TX?

[31-Jul-18 11:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is that just the KMD TX

[31-Jul-18 11:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
I thought that's what we were racing for

[31-Jul-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but to get into beskmaks the fastest and be included in a round, all you need to do is ca;lculate the hash thats sent to BTC chain, the actual BTC transaction comes later in the process

[31-Jul-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why we need a KMD wallet for this, seems just to amke sure we actually have the UTXO to make the TX

[31-Jul-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems the bottelnexk in the code

[31-Jul-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Decker hardware accelerated the cacluation of the hash and it pales in comparison to just using less utxo.

[31-Jul-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
Is that code public?

[31-Jul-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not 100% sure, he has posted it around a few times so should be

[31-Jul-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Decker

[31-Jul-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
so what exactly is hardware accelerated?

[31-Jul-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
SHA256?

[31-Jul-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sha256 hashing function

[31-Jul-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
in KMD?

[31-Jul-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no in iguana

[31-Jul-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh

[31-Jul-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even with that your still bottlenecked ny UTXO selection in the KMD deamon

[31-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Decker#3767
now, all remembered about hardware acceleration ) nice )

[31-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Decker#3767
yes, code is in public in SuperNet repo on my git ... `dev-decker-sha256` branch.

[31-Jul-18 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now if Luke can use that and see if he overtakes Alien_AR before anyone else please lol
üôè

[31-Jul-18 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we know what the settings for all nodes should be

[31-Jul-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and we can move to that, so that all these what are basically cheats can get gotten rid of :trollface:

[31-Jul-18 11:51 AM] Decker#3767
let explain we describe all settings and optimisations and 100% nodes will use it ... anyway winner will be nodes who has better hardware )

[31-Jul-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm true...

[31-Jul-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats also comething we need to avoid happening

[31-Jul-18 11:52 AM] Decker#3767
so, i'm decided the better way is to buy better hardware right now )

[31-Jul-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I simply can't.... dont have the money.

[31-Jul-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did not have to share any of my findings but I did anyway

[31-Jul-18 11:53 AM] Decker#3767
1500 KMD (average monthly notary reward) is closer to enough to build a good server (or main part of it).

[31-Jul-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not when I have to share it

[31-Jul-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it was all mine.. sure first 2-3 months I would ahve built new server

[31-Jul-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly
