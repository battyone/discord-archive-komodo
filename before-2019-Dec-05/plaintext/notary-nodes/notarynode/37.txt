Not sure about how many dev nodes there are. Will check that first

[02-Mar-19 07:25 AM] kolo#1111
Auto advance rules will be also advanced to count different assets differently - to be more fair

[02-Mar-19 07:26 AM] kolo#1111
There is also a secret list where @kolo marks notary operator involvement since last 7 months. It will affect.

[02-Mar-19 09:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
is there a date for when we should submit proposals?

[03-Mar-19 05:49 AM] Mylo#8306
Good luck @lukechilds you‚Äôre an excellent dev and operator.

[03-Mar-19 05:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
Thanks!

@Notary-Operator 
I made first very long announce about elections, but it doesn't fit to discord. Please read here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/blob/master/announce1.md
This one is about your node online representation.

thanks @kolo

[06-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
been eagerly awaiting posts

[06-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
heard you were election master

[06-Mar-19 03:25 AM] kolo#1111
@Dr.Terminus it‚Äôs so since last year. Not a news.

[06-Mar-19 09:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
When we will know which nodes are automatically re-elected?

[06-Mar-19 09:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just top 32?

[06-Mar-19 09:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can an official list be published? @kolo

[06-Mar-19 10:03 AM] ca333#0118
The last 12 months probably equal "the real proposal" for this years NN elections and specially the last 3 - 6 months, when the market was very bloody, did show us who is truly doing this for the security and stability of Komodo network. This could well be reflected in the election results...

[06-Mar-19 10:03 AM] ca333#0118
@siu - Chainmakers - yes - the top 50%.

[06-Mar-19 10:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok. So i better start doing campaign for my node since im like number 34

[06-Mar-19 10:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Vote for Chainmakers-NA! Your most trusted service provider for Komodo Technology!

[06-Mar-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was under the impression it was the top 7 of each region

[06-Mar-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as the SH region is at a major dissavdantage

[06-Mar-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am 9th anyway ... so it doesnt matter

[06-Mar-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to me

[06-Mar-19 10:14 AM] ca333#0118
I dislike the "NN mushrooms" - like the OPs that out of the sudden pop up when they see "oh its election times". And rest of the year you wont hear/see much from them.

[06-Mar-19 10:14 AM] ca333#0118 (pinned)
everyone 

This year i will periodically give out objective recommendations based on what a NN operator did for the KMD ecosystem but also based on the skillz level and professionalism. I will start with two community members that have been around for more than a year now - this will be the 2nd NN era in which we are happy to have them on board. 

@blackjok3r and @Alright are two very active and supportive Devs, IT experts and Blockchain architects. They have launched up an ecosystem project called #kmdlabs and thanks to their efforts a set of various bugs and issues was fixed on the Notary Node Network but also in the Komodo Blockchain network. Having each of them run a set of Notary Nodes across the globe and hopefully in each region is highly recommended for the stability and security of our network.

i would still want to see an official list from @kolo or one of his cats

[06-Mar-19 10:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But blackjoker is in the top 32 anyway!, vote for Chainmakers NA which is the top of the lower 32 :p

[06-Mar-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think my node is in the top...

[06-Mar-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in fact im sure its not

[06-Mar-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its right at the boarderline though

[06-Mar-19 10:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but you seem to be going to be automatically re-elected

[06-Mar-19 10:17 AM] Ludom#5832
Hi @ca333  I'm a mushroom üçÑ

[06-Mar-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It lost months of notarizations at the start before I knew what I was doing...

[06-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jeezy#3408
@siu - Chainmakers  @kolo   the most important question is  is it total 32 or  by region divided

[06-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jeezy#3408
could be a very important detail

[06-Mar-19 10:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, that is why i would like an official list

[06-Mar-19 10:18 AM] Ludom#5832
Anyway, great to see the election again

[06-Mar-19 10:18 AM] ca333#0118
@Ludom - i dont think so. You got us projects onboard and arranged meetups, etc. - for example Crypto Union - you have pushed them into KMD world. Am i right?

[06-Mar-19 10:18 AM] Ludom#5832
I was kiding

[06-Mar-19 10:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also i see @SHossain with a dev tag, does this mean that he is not going to be part of the top 32 and just a dev node?

[06-Mar-19 10:19 AM] ca333#0118
maybe a hybrid mushroom

[06-Mar-19 10:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
those details are important since im literally 1 or 2 places below top 32

[06-Mar-19 10:19 AM] Ludom#5832
And I'm not alone. Ind√©Nodes is @eclips  and @Yassin  too

[06-Mar-19 10:19 AM] jeezy#3408
yea,  can we subtract all  nodes from the 32  that have  *dev*  in them?

[06-Mar-19 10:20 AM] jorian#4555
we must wait for kolo to return

[06-Mar-19 10:20 AM] Ludom#5832
Ok, I don't know how many nodes will be reelected

[06-Mar-19 10:20 AM] ca333#0118
@siu - Chainmakers - just ONE of shossains nodes was qualified as a dev node for this NN era.

[06-Mar-19 10:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@blackjok3r  and @Alright have spent multiple hours helping someone with no knowledge to stake a coin at their own loss of time and stake. You both have worked hard in the background always testing and helping the community üôå

You both get the vote of me and my group of investors üò¨

[06-Mar-19 10:20 AM] ca333#0118
DEV nodes will not be substracted since they are below top 32...

[06-Mar-19 10:21 AM] ca333#0118
if you create an excelt table and just sort all nodes you will see who would make it right now.

[06-Mar-19 10:21 AM] jeezy#3408
a lot of dev nodes are very high up in scores

[06-Mar-19 10:21 AM] ca333#0118
the only dev nodes are in the "dev" box - consider the other ones no dev nodes.

[06-Mar-19 10:22 AM] Ludom#5832
I don't know how many nodes will be reelected for Ind√©Nodes but I have only one regret : the reelection system is not transparent AND not decentralised at all

[06-Mar-19 10:22 AM] ca333#0118
why? its based on a transparent score system @Ludom

[06-Mar-19 10:22 AM] jorian#4555
why do we have kolo when ca333 seems to have all the answers?

[06-Mar-19 10:22 AM] Ludom#5832
I really like @kolo but he is not a decentralised guy üòÉ

[06-Mar-19 10:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
I thought the other nodes not in the dev box were changed to dev nodes because they were in the wrong regions and therefore violating the rules?

Is it just based on the score @ca333 ?

Komodo Notary Nodes Stats
Statistics for the Komodo Platform's dPOW notarization of KMD and supported blockchains.

[06-Mar-19 10:23 AM] ca333#0118
the automatic reelection is based purely on score and probably any disqualification rules that were set up last year.

[06-Mar-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also the score counts the KMD txns... when the network was flooding -26 errors, a extrmely large amount of notarizations were counted that did not create a checkpoint... so when we correct this flaw the stats will change a LOT I would say.

[06-Mar-19 10:24 AM] Ludom#5832
Yes but is it the 8 best on each region or the 32 best of all the world ?

[06-Mar-19 10:24 AM] Ludom#5832
Or less ?

[06-Mar-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
by region

[06-Mar-19 10:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
top half of each region was what was said last year I believe

[06-Mar-19 10:24 AM] ca333#0118
Kolo is the official master and only his replies will count as 100% valid. I am just trying to give you answers based on the infos i have.

[06-Mar-19 10:25 AM] Ludom#5832
That's not decentralized. But that don't change anything from my side

[06-Mar-19 10:26 AM] Ludom#5832
I just hope we'll make better for 2020

[06-Mar-19 10:26 AM] Ludom#5832
üòÉ

[06-Mar-19 10:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, so its global top 32 or top 7 of each region? These details need to ne clear before anything else

[06-Mar-19 10:27 AM] Ludom#5832
I really like the effort of transparence on the election 2019 but we can make it better.

[06-Mar-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
@siu - Chainmakers what part of "by region" is ambiguous?

[06-Mar-19 10:27 AM] ca333#0118
by region @siu - Chainmakers

[06-Mar-19 10:28 AM] Ludom#5832
I'm just writing to stimulate the evolution for the best.

[06-Mar-19 10:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, since ca said top 50% first, im just looking for the official official answer

[06-Mar-19 10:28 AM] jeezy#3408
32/4=8  so   its  top 8 of each region?

[06-Mar-19 10:28 AM] ca333#0118
top 50% first should automagically let you imply by region. anything else just wont make any sense common sense wise.

[06-Mar-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems some regions have more.less nodes exactly how many per region get auto election?

[06-Mar-19 10:29 AM] Ludom#5832
I'm in crypto for decentralized systems and economics

[06-Mar-19 10:29 AM] ca333#0118
@blackjok3r probably top 8 to match 32?

[06-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
divide the number of nodes in each region by 2

{Reactions}
üëç 

[06-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the number of automatic spots

[06-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
why such controversy over >>= 1?

[06-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jeezy#3408
ok so SH has  7.5  automatic spots

[06-Mar-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
in a case of any ambiguity, kolo is election master

[06-Mar-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
no fractions in >>=

[06-Mar-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just if its 8 in SH... I need to start attackin peertocloud to get that 8th spot :troll:

if its 7... there is no point

[06-Mar-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldnt do it lol... was joke.

[06-Mar-19 10:30 AM] Ludom#5832
It' could be a good test on the security of each notary

[06-Mar-19 10:31 AM] Ludom#5832
Because it can be a point of failure in the future

[06-Mar-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I m not sure anyone else knows how to do it, or defend against it at this point in time... but all the code to defend the only attack that I know of has been merged, but needs to be activated in the code. üòÉ

[06-Mar-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless there is some other attack... Realy all it would do is slow down other notaris... notarizations would continue regardless.. so it would be obvious you were doing it. There is no point.

[06-Mar-19 10:32 AM] ca333#0118
57 total NN count = 28.5 (~29) NNs get autoelected according to komodostats and the info from above.

[06-Mar-19 10:33 AM] jeezy#3408
@jl777c  can you project next years minimal specs?  like 500GB SSD is running very slim already so 1 TB SSD should be minimum,  what about cores and RAM is it ok to stay about equal as this year?

[06-Mar-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i think 500GB SSD is indeed on the small side

[06-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Ludom#5832
Do you take dev nody in your math ?

[06-Mar-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The min was 1Tb last year and som ppl ignored it

[06-Mar-19 10:34 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jeezy more projects will be onboarded next year, so i wouls recommend to start with what you have right now and move to bigger hardware

[06-Mar-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 3TB SSd in my server, using RAID1 atm but I will be taking that off for straight disks when I re do the node and change keys.
