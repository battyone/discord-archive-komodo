CHIPS is needing some help (financial, GUI) so it would be good to have a candidate that supports CHIPS

@jl777c What would be your thoughts about a candidate who share a part of his revenues with his voters and would support CHIPS too?

[13-Apr-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
seems too complicated to think about. bribery is bribery, not sure supporting CHIPS cancels out the stigma

[13-Apr-19 08:36 AM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[13-Apr-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if there was a CHIPS supporting candidate without bribes, i would likely vote for them assuming they are proven on testnet. if with bribes, then likely not

[13-Apr-19 08:38 AM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks for your precisions

[13-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c do you know why the daemon would be refusing to put multiple txs like these into a block? I have ~140 in my mempool, but the daemon will only try to put 1 in a block. 
https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/block/000ff41e103418de6d89f5528c9b5087db5836df4be788d675c9b078da83c8a4

[13-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
Even that single tx makes the block very hard to propagate/broadcast btw

[13-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
do believe we're going to have problems for a txscl test because of this

[13-Apr-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
not enough txfee

[13-Apr-19 08:40 AM] newvulcan#4719
Might have an idea on how I can promote the use of KMD here in the UK. Don't want to promise anything yet, got to talk to a few people on Monday, but hopefully my idea might have legs so to speak.

[13-Apr-19 08:40 AM] Alright#0419
I'm mining them myself. How would i change that?

[13-Apr-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
there is some miner config that changes the number of free/low txfee that is included in block. dont know which

[13-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Alright#0419
ok thank you

[13-Apr-19 08:57 AM] gt#2812

Any estimates on cost to get a GUI developed? ~KMD/month?

[13-Apr-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c took *5* minutes for this to propagate across the network 
https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/block/0003b9686c8a4b394c45de975aeaddb126a8c0713b296cf60aba972a9dcd1fb3

[13-Apr-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
zero outputs, low txfee, i thought below dust amounts would get rejected

[13-Apr-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
dust is mempool rule not consensus

[13-Apr-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
but I don't think that's related

[13-Apr-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
any block with massive txs takes a very long time to propagate

[13-Apr-19 09:04 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
afaik 1¬µ/b is the threshhold

[13-Apr-19 09:05 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

@mrlynchMaybe its just early in the morning, but is there a way to track a transaction into TXSCLCC ? Balance is still zero. Do I have to manually direct the funds to it or will it take a while to confirm ?

[13-Apr-19 09:22 AM] Strob#3417
@jl777c If elected and if you vote for me, I can allocate 7% of my mining profits (after tax) to support CHIPS! (just created a PR to add the promise to my proposal).

[13-Apr-19 09:23 AM] newvulcan#4719
Must have typed something wrong, 'cause I went through dexstats earlier and said it didn't exist. Never mind, thanks for the info üòÉ

[13-Apr-19 09:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
if you can't split you'll have to send the balance to yourself

[13-Apr-19 09:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
and try splitting after that

[13-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Audo#5667
is there some website that
a) tracks live results (other than through the explorer)
b) shows candidates by region and links to their profile

If there are, we would like to link to those pages from the komodoelecton.com, if not, we have to think about a workaround solution.

yes I did not know how to handle lumberscout so I did not add him.
Not sure if it's allowed to pick the location after the voting ended
I also removed for example badman which is in the repo but not running.
