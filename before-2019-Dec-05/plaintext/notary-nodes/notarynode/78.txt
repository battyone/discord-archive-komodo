@blackjok3r you are shelling out to git and doing lots of crazy shite, aren't you?

[03-Apr-19 04:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
seriously, it does some really nice error checking, tho

[03-Apr-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... It took a long long time to get that script stable lol... its stupid complicated

[03-Apr-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hardly even rember how it works

[03-Apr-19 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
error checking was the most imporant because it was designed for noobs to use with as little training as possible

[03-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator if you're using the utxosplitter from LABS, and you're getting that listunspent failed error, it means you spent your last 0.0001 and it didn't know what to do

[03-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
Don't like it get down to 1 0.0001 utxo

[03-Apr-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that exception can be removed

[03-Apr-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was only there from when iguana was broken

[03-Apr-19 05:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm using something else now, it's simple but so far it works. hopefully have time to pythonise this weekend

Spent all night on this, I just had to remove my router cause my new modem supplied by my isp was not set as a bridge like I thought but was acting as a second router blocking incoming connection even though I opened the ports on it and on my personnal router. At one point I was out of internet and not able to connect to the modem interface, by luck I have 24h support so my isp could reset their modem and I could fix all my problems!!! So now I'm back!

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I use the decker autosplit and it was working flawlessly on my previous server but since I switch to another server with nvme drives, the script doesn't recognize my utxo and split too much. When I run it manually it works, but it fail in a cron job.

[03-Apr-19 08:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I might just set my alarm to go off every 20 minutes for the next couple of weeks, setup a hotkey macro and put my laptop on the bedside table.

[03-Apr-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to make sure there is only 1 utxo that you can split

[03-Apr-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is 2 utxo that it can split it can split mroe than once before the tx is confirmed

[03-Apr-19 08:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181

This command will merge all utxos that are not uguana utxo onto a single one.

[03-Apr-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The trick is having just 1 utxo to split

What is the recommended branch for notaries to be on. Both of the setup guides say Beta in /jl777/komodo, is this correct?

[03-Apr-19 01:44 PM] PHBA2061#2530
where did you find "beta" , should be "dev" instead if I'm  not wrong

[03-Apr-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@NutellaLicka whichever one syncs OUR 😛

{Reactions}
😂 

[03-Apr-19 01:45 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Actually you're right, the NN setup says dev. The installing KMD manually says beta.

[03-Apr-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if OUR doesn't sync then you're on the wrong one

[03-Apr-19 01:46 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe OUR requires dev branch

[03-Apr-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm using FSM but that should be equal with dev and beta right now

[03-Apr-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I use it too, but isn't FSM a little "young" for NNs?

[03-Apr-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well usually yes... But when its merged down no... Labs is usually equal with it, or jl777 at times when I know it builds

[03-Apr-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Komodod can have buggy code in places, as long as on the existing chains it doesn't call it its fine

[03-Apr-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`or jl777 at times when I know it builds`
the latter part of that is why I stopped using it outside of testing 😛

[03-Apr-19 01:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You use komodoplatform/komodo?

Hello there. I have read this example in the wiki:

[03-Apr-19 02:22 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
0.0001 * aprox. 144 (btc blocks per day) = aprox. 0.0144

[03-Apr-19 02:23 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
If I understood well, it would cost me 0.432 BTC a month to mantain a Notary Node?

[03-Apr-19 02:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes but the BTC comes from the Komodo ICO fund

[03-Apr-19 02:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
so you don't have to buy it

[03-Apr-19 02:27 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
How do I receive this from the ICO Fund?

[03-Apr-19 02:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
you will have to be elected and than your address will be funded in time

[03-Apr-19 02:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
someone from the kmd team sends it to your node btc address

[03-Apr-19 02:29 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
PErfect, that is what I wanted to know

[03-Apr-19 02:29 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Thanks!

[03-Apr-19 02:34 PM] SHossain#0007
required BTC sent to each elected node when necessary by Kolo

[03-Apr-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181

use a better server than your current one (not necessary)

[03-Apr-19 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$ for $ I'm not sure you can get a "better" one for 4 chains

[03-Apr-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, if $ is important it is _not necessary_
if number is important 🤷🏽

[03-Apr-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I meant that afaik, the only "better" option is more overkill as this is already more than needed for 4 chains

you guys dont sleep.... I'm getting back to this after some needed sleep.  I'm using https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet instead of https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET for testnet per recommendation last night.  Documentation a little unclear to me.  `Edit the iguana/m_notary_testnet file. Add a line with your IP address.` is easy, in fact is not needed because is set automatically then `Edit the iguana/testnet.json file. Add your pubkey and name.` Which pubkey?  Wallet on the node or pubkey for the address used for votes or other?

[03-Apr-19 04:20 PM] Strob#3417
the goal is to have all your assets addresses having the same pubkey

you will import the private  key in each wallet

[03-Apr-19 04:20 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

[03-Apr-19 04:22 PM] Strob#3417
the KMD private is called BTCDwif

[03-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Strob#3417
The important step is this command where you get your pubkey (called btcpubkey and not pubkey!!!) and the KMDwif called BTCDwif. A bit confusing but that's the way it is. ```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7778" --data "{\"agent\":\"bitcoinrpc\",\"method\":\"encryptwallet\",\"passphrase\":\"insert very secure password here\"}"```

[03-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Greer#0666
I'm right in that 2019NNtestnet replaces SuperNET?

[03-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Strob#3417
yes

[03-Apr-19 04:32 PM] Strob#3417
But if you want to understand the whole process I think it's better to follow the instructions above and then you follow the testnet instructions
