ok i see.  thx

```is HP ProLiant DL360e Gen8 2x Eight 8-Core Xeon E5-2450L 64 gb ram 500gb ssd good enough for a notarynote for testnet?```
I use similar configuration with double old xeons for testnet, just have 196gb RAM (but it's overkill for sure)

[15-Apr-19 05:49 AM] hastrup#8742
so the speed if the cou is not that significant

[15-Apr-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
load average is usually around 0.1

[15-Apr-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[15-Apr-19 05:50 AM] hastrup#8742
ok thx for the input

[15-Apr-19 05:51 AM] TonyL#3577
network bandwith/latency and SSD I/O are the key factors imo (especially when there are only 3 chains) + scripts for cleaning stuff

just say no to 10M down and 0.5M up 😭

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  have you ever had a power outage for your servers?

[15-Apr-19 06:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hastrup sadly, yes

[15-Apr-19 06:17 AM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is that a commen "problem" in the US?

[15-Apr-19 06:18 AM] hastrup#8742
and do ou have a ups for theres times?

[15-Apr-19 06:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more so where I live -- in the middle of nowhere and prone to thunderstorms

[15-Apr-19 06:18 AM] hastrup#8742
wow

[15-Apr-19 06:18 AM] hastrup#8742
them damn thunderstorms lol

[15-Apr-19 06:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's cheaper to replace my entire server than get a 220v ups for it 😛

[15-Apr-19 06:20 AM] hastrup#8742
XD

[15-Apr-19 08:36 AM] newvulcan#4719
Morning. I see I'm last (Well someone has to be). Anyway quick question. I've noticed my UTXO count for KMD just keeps increasing - its at 766 at the moment. Is that normal behaviour, or should those UTXO's be going somewhere ?

[15-Apr-19 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you should disable taht if you wantyour testnet node to work.

[15-Apr-19 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its important to manage utxos perfectly to maintain a top node.

[15-Apr-19 09:02 AM] gt#2812
@newvulcan if you search through this channel, you’ll find posts about utxo management

[15-Apr-19 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r once I spent all the 1 sat utxos from another node, my node stopped having listunspent errors

[15-Apr-19 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't really matter, just thought it was interesting

[15-Apr-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I spoke to genie about it earlier, it seems it had msotly to do with using 2 wallets on 2 nodes...

[15-Apr-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
importing without rescanning is a shit solution is what I've learned

[15-Apr-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
I only ever had 1 node with the wallet until I brought the second up to spend the dust

[15-Apr-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a hacky fix... shouldnt be relied upon unless you ahve no other choice.

For those of you who are interessted looks like Agama stores some Election related Data on the Blockchain when you Vote ( Check the last output ).  Maybe at some point in our lifes we see Blockchain Voting for General Elections.

can i remind all voters to take a look at how current NN's that are also candidates for next season are doing: #notary-node-alarms

[15-Apr-19 12:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
do any have excuses (valid or otherwise) for not notarising since so long?

[15-Apr-19 12:36 PM] jorian#4555
cost?

[15-Apr-19 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is jealous because his converter doesn't look that pretty_

[15-Apr-19 12:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
they still mining tho?

[15-Apr-19 12:39 PM] jorian#4555
yes, they're still mining

[15-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jorian#4555
you can check for yourself

[15-Apr-19 12:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
🤦

[15-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jorian#4555
they probably gave up on being notary and since they wouldn't be re-elected anyways they just cancelled their expensive server

[15-Apr-19 12:40 PM] CrisF#3405
And ther're running again?

[15-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jorian#4555
but that's not for the candidates for next season though

[15-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jorian#4555
no, i don't think so

[15-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jorian#4555
the ones that gave up, gave up

[15-Apr-19 12:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so nn mining can be done from anywhere?

[15-Apr-19 12:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I asked one of them directly last night and got obscenities hurled at me, maybe you'll have better luck 🤷🏽

[15-Apr-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
nn mining is cpu

[15-Apr-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
so yes, even your phone can mine it

[15-Apr-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
and even more since a notary is only eligible to mine again 65 blocks after mining the previous block

[15-Apr-19 12:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
need to use daemon with nn pubkey? or just address?

[15-Apr-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`they probably gave up on being notary and since they wouldn't be re-elected anyways they just cancelled their expensive server`
not all of the, at least one is running for 3 nodes this year

[15-Apr-19 12:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
You also need the priv key as each blocked mined send a small fee to the crypto address. I guess to avoid somebody elses mines with your pubkey ( to you address )

[15-Apr-19 12:43 PM] jorian#4555
yep

[15-Apr-19 12:44 PM] jorian#4555
but that's not too much of a problem

[15-Apr-19 12:45 PM] jorian#4555
you can send the new rewards to cold storage to not have an open wallet somewhere, and maybe it's better to send new rewards away to profit from the 5.1%

[15-Apr-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`even your phone can mine it`
so, other than courtesy, what's to stop a NN form mining with *stronger* equipment?

[15-Apr-19 12:45 PM] jorian#4555
nothing, but it won't get you more KMD

[15-Apr-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
round-robin selection for eligibility?

[15-Apr-19 12:46 PM] jorian#4555
something like that yes

[15-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jorian#4555
you get eligible 65 blocks after mining your last block

[15-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jorian#4555
so in the mean time, you can save the energy because you won't mine one anwyays

[15-Apr-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh k

[15-Apr-19 12:55 PM] jorian#4555
i'm a Notary Node operator, ask me anything!

[15-Apr-19 01:01 PM] mrlynch#5735

@jorian - Chainmakers Hi :-)

[15-Apr-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Does anyone else on testnet see -26 errors?

[15-Apr-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or is it a bug with my iguana from my changes today? Not seeing them on mainnet at all, so I assume its someone with a corrupted wallet. I have ways to find out who is doing it.

[15-Apr-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not new

[15-Apr-19 01:19 PM] CrisF#3405

[15-Apr-19 01:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Any data around there useful for you?
