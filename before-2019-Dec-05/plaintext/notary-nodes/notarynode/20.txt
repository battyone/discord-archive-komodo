Some changes should be reflected pretty much instantly, but I'd need to run them for at least a day, probably a couple of days to get a good comparison on the chart

[14-Aug-18 08:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
awesome

[14-Aug-18 08:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
is the code available btw?

[14-Aug-18 08:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
I might be able to help out a little

[14-Aug-18 08:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm pretty short for time atm with HyperDEX though

[14-Aug-18 08:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
haha, I won't judge

[14-Aug-18 08:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, ping me if you open source it

[14-Aug-18 09:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
man I fucking hate GAME

[14-Aug-18 09:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
my TXs always get stuck

[14-Aug-18 09:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
and I'm getting 500 errors trying to braodcast via their API

[14-Aug-18 09:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
could anyone help me out and broadcast my TX

[14-Aug-18 09:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
just run this

[14-Aug-18 09:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
oh yeah, no blocks for 34 mins

[14-Aug-18 09:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
but their shitty explorer doesn't show TXs in the mempool

[14-Aug-18 09:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
so I have no idea if my TX has been broadcast or not

[14-Aug-18 09:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not sure

[14-Aug-18 09:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think maybe a custom one

[14-Aug-18 09:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
I've not seen one like it before

[14-Aug-18 09:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, it doesn't work very well though

[14-Aug-18 09:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
no mempool TXs is really annoying

[14-Aug-18 09:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
especially when they don't get a block for >30 mins

[14-Aug-18 09:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User Can you add me as friend so I can DM you?

It‚Äôs custom.  They import blockchain data to mongodb the rumour that swirls around

[15-Aug-18 12:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
That's a shame

[15-Aug-18 12:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
does anyone know if an insight or other generic explorer exists for Game?

[15-Aug-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
those are the ones that your node has found out about and done a nn_connect to

[15-Aug-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
a nn_connect doesnt mean it connected, just that it will try to connect

[15-Aug-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it is

[15-Aug-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can filter the bad ones out by nc to port 17775 as per deckers script... I made mine connect to all good ones first, but putting `addnotary` call for all nodes seemed to make it work worse, but it may have been unrelated

[15-Aug-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is one in SA beginning with 177 that is also an old ip

[15-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
just a thought but maybe adding new notaries pushes old ones out

[15-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
so the highest priority goes to the most recent call

[15-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
so you would actually want to call all the good nodes last, not first

[15-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's not based on anything

[15-Aug-18 09:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
just a random idea

[15-Aug-18 09:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
might be worth a try

[15-Aug-18 09:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
but that might explain why it made it worse

[15-Aug-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think it made any diffrence tbh, but after I was playing around with it my counts did go down in general.

[15-Aug-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That might have more to do with other people all using optimisations now though.

[15-Aug-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But if I force addnotary all the ones with open ports, the list had less "dead" ips in it.

Where should we install GameCredits from? https://github.com/GameCredits/GameCredits.git (mentioned in the guide) 404's. Is the master branch on https://github.com/jl777/GameCredits right?

Was something recently changed with autosplit? Do we need to crontab splitfunds now?

[16-Aug-18 12:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
no, autosplit still works

[16-Aug-18 12:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
but some people have opted for their own custom scripts in cron to manage it better

[16-Aug-18 12:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
autosplit sometimes ends up giving you way more UTXOs than you need

[16-Aug-18 12:45 AM] Jax#4739
@lukechilds I see, thanks. I've been having issues with running out of kmd utxos in a sufficiently funded wallet. Probably gonna move to a crontab.

[16-Aug-18 05:02 AM] jeezy#3408
verus broken after latest pull?

[16-Aug-18 05:02 AM] jeezy#3408
build fails with an error

[16-Aug-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dunno cant build it on my node üò¶

[16-Aug-18 09:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
we should probably not update any coin daemons unless they are hard forking changes or include specific notary fixes

[16-Aug-18 09:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
notary nodes are sacred

[16-Aug-18 09:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
every time you run new software on them you put them at risk

[16-Aug-18 09:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
the most important thing is that we run stable daemons

[16-Aug-18 09:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
not the latest bleeding edge builds

[16-Aug-18 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
totally agree

[16-Aug-18 09:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
I believe so

[16-Aug-18 09:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
how many notary operators here actually read through every change in the entire diff before upgrading

[16-Aug-18 09:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
I would bet my money on none, if any

[16-Aug-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We should also possibly move back to beta from dev komodo I think maybe to... as we have STAKED project to test DEV  branch now, which should find the bugs we were meant to find.

[16-Aug-18 09:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
not to mention for 3rd party daemons it would be very easy to hide
e.g some obscure file pulled down in the build script and executed

[16-Aug-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
you could easily miss that in a diff

[16-Aug-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
or even check the remote file and see it's good

[16-Aug-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
but then they could change it to something malicious at any point

[16-Aug-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
easy back door

[16-Aug-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's not even that uncommon for build scripts to pull in external files

[16-Aug-18 10:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Differentiate staked and dev would make it less risky. For external daemons as long as notarize is fine yeah we should not update until requested by coin team

[16-Aug-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
for example VRSC didn't do consensous changing update, so, we  can skip this. i didn't update mine.

Check out prev commits on dev when it not compiles. It's easy. Was said that day by day debugging and testing is also job of NN ops. Not just keeping old stable beta.

[16-Aug-18 03:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
That sounds like a very bad mix

[16-Aug-18 03:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
we need to run ultra tight secure nodes

[16-Aug-18 03:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
while also testing and debugging bleeding edge changes

[16-Aug-18 03:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
Those two things are mutually exclusive

[16-Aug-18 03:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can do one or the other, not both

[16-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Mainnet : secure. Testnet : experimental

[16-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
That would be awesome

[16-Aug-18 03:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, that's definitely a possibility

[16-Aug-18 03:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
although was not aware that was something we we're expected to be doing

[16-Aug-18 03:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
will also increase hosting costs quite a bit

[16-Aug-18 03:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it would be good to have a testnet node to test my perf improvements on

[16-Aug-18 03:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
before making them live on my mainnet node

[16-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Testnet don t need ultra high perf

[16-Aug-18 03:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
but you still need lots of RAM for UTXO set right?

[16-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
A basic dedicated with ssd average 50 60 ‚Ç¨ a month

[16-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nope

[16-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Only sync time is expensive in term of ram

[16-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
For testnet 16 strict minimum 32 would be best

[16-Aug-18 03:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
I was under the impression the entire UTXO set for all coins is stored in RAM

[16-Aug-18 03:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
is that not true?

[16-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Afaik most usage comes from iguana when everything is synced

[16-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like 4 ~ 7 g

[16-Aug-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think so

[16-Aug-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
for me iguana is using about 4MB RAM

[16-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll check live a sec

[16-Aug-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
makes sense

[16-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Report tells me 20% of 128gb is used

[16-Aug-18 03:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
I wouldn't expect it to need much

[16-Aug-18 03:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
purely by iguana?

[16-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
No
