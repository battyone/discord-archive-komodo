my a-team one gets about 0.025s I was never able to get it faster due to hardware limitations

[05-Apr-19 01:06 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Sweet, I have room for improvement

[05-Apr-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think nvme directly attached to CPU and very fast RAM is teh best thing to increase speed of that call.

[05-Apr-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As sofftware side, I think ive gotten it as fast as I can bar huge changes to how it works.

[05-Apr-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Something like a single AMD 64 core prosessor that is comming out soon would dominate I think. Cost like $20k though lol.

[05-Apr-19 01:09 PM] zatJUM#9924
When I restarted PIZZA manually, I ran this:
```komodod -pubkey=037771b436a20c52ebde65400cebf0d4e7f45d69e748955443b3255a68cc6c38f5 -ac_name=PIZZA -ac_supply=100000000```

I'm not notarizing anymore PIZZA

[05-Apr-19 01:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
maybe -reindex

[05-Apr-19 01:12 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@Strob thank you 😄

[05-Apr-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@VoskCoin there are some posted if you scroll back, but some of it has been confusing folks since we're not doing full BTC notarizations

[05-Apr-19 01:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
Trying to reindex

[05-Apr-19 01:14 PM] Strob#3417
In short we notarize BEER, PIZZA and TXSCLCC on KMD. so you need to create wallets for those 4 asset with the same pubkey and wif.

{Reactions}
😄 treasure 

[05-Apr-19 01:15 PM] Strob#3417
@zatJUM You also have argument in the conf file so you would need to know what's iin there too to see if you are missing anyting like -addnode for example

[05-Apr-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
install komodo from jl777 dev/FSM branch 
install iguana from the offical repo or mine (if you want more notarizations) 
start BEER PIZZA and TXSCLCC with -pubkey
make wp_776 file and pubkey.txt 
start m_notary_testnet

[05-Apr-19 01:15 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 did we do btc notarizations last year on testnet? 🤔

[05-Apr-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

@VoskCoin glad to see you didn't head for the hills... you've got a good chance to win if popularity won KMD elections 😄

[05-Apr-19 01:23 PM] Strob#3417
Q: if we don't use encrypted wallet would that work to just create a KMD address, get the pubkey wit validateaddress, dump wif, then start PIZZA BEER and TXS with -pubkey=YOURPUBKEYHERE and then import wif to all 3 nodes

[05-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Strob#3417
@zatJUM You can also use addnode to force connection to peers, you can add a max of 8. Which one are the best are the ones you can get the faster ping to. Iguana already add 8 peers though I'm not sure how they were chosen (I think there're just the 8 first of us who started.) see testnet.json  I wonder if someone changed those to get faster ones and I wonder if there are ip other than ours that we could try. like from an offical komodo peer list.

Dont use the LABS komodod on this testnet, it doesn twork. Just incase anyone did that.

you can set rpc port to whatever you want

is it better to change the rpc ports to something else than the suggested ones?

doesnt matter at all.

Just don't have them open on your firewall :troll:

[05-Apr-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the reason I change for miners was due to pool configs; beyond that, I'd say leave as default so as to not end up chasing your tail if you ever want to use via port
