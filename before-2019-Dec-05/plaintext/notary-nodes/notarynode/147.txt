`no op should need to see this and its not for testnet. `
And dafuq happens a moth from now when you have the job?

[17-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Greer#0666
I'm concerned what happens in a month from now when a bunch of guys that know a little c but nothing about best practices or running a modern reliable and secure linux server get the job.  Servers kept running by bash scripts borrowed form others, running other bash scripts from different people, calling unnecessary python scripts.  Those people are not more qualified as proven by some of last years ops.

`lower the barrier `
You can't "lower the barrier" of a technical job
Do you want you doctor to have only taken basic bio in grade 9 and no uni courses?

[17-Apr-19 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User You want your doctor to start learning before you are in the patient waiting area? or during?

[17-Apr-19 04:06 AM] Greer#0666
I have been surprised by how simple all of this has been, its just made out to be so complicated, seemingly on purpose.

Besides you and Lumbi, no one has made it out to be complicated

[17-Apr-19 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`More people starting studies means better doctors at the end of the years.`
Yes, but we're not talking about end of years, if @VoskCoin gets elected @Greer starts doing his job for him in a few weeks

[17-Apr-19 04:08 AM] Greer#0666
accept that there are things that others know that you may not.  Then consider that those people, instead of sharing what they know, obfuscate it because they believe you not worthy.  Now apply it to this and tell me how that is good for Komodo.

I left that bit out of the analogy, your doctor isn't going to see you, he's sending in an intern that hasn't made it to grade 6 yet

[17-Apr-19 04:09 AM] Greer#0666
I learned more from BeNN.sh than I did all of the documentation that I found.  Its that simple

[17-Apr-19 04:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`this is why i think that testnet should have started long ago.`
Because you have to wait for testnet to exist before learning and asking questions?

[17-Apr-19 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
I started the testnet long before it needed to enter

[17-Apr-19 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
Exist*

[17-Apr-19 04:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i think so, testnet is important`
but it's not because he wants the docs for functions and whys
again, you can't have it both ways

[17-Apr-19 04:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`the code is the docs`

[17-Apr-19 04:10 AM] Greer#0666
benn.sh deconstructed should be the start of the testnet readme, let the ops set it up how they want.  I dont use the script, I have each in a container, but couldn't have done that without simply seeing that the coins are all copies of the same daemon with the ac param creating new chains.

[17-Apr-19 04:11 AM] Alright#0419

[17-Apr-19 04:20 AM] Greer#0666
your problem is you know a few nuggets of information that you are taking for granted and while anyone with half a brain could understand these nuggets, Satoshi Nakamoto himself couldn't be expected to just understand without either an explaination or wasting a lot of time in discovering what could just be explained/documented.

I know you've seen every dumb thing every one of us has typed and done....

[17-Apr-19 04:21 AM] Greer#0666
@Alright You should write a bash script that calls another bash script that calls a python script to generate some json with my name in an array of all names from this server to pass to another bash script to use jq to select my name to keep running that statement every 10 minutes here.

8hrs I'd have like to have spent working on container management for mainnet

[17-Apr-19 04:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

To my knowledge, no one on the internal team will be spending a lot of time improving Notary Node documentation, for several reasons. I received instructions from management early on to leave them alone. 

Gcharang deals with them the most, and I don't believe he's making changes. 

If a notary node were to get elected on the campaign promise of improving the docs, that would be something to look at. 

Anyhow, have a good night, all.

if you think that makes me a poor op, I disagree.  the NN part is way easier to learn than keeping a secure reliable server

I think that not knowing what it entails makes you a poor op, and to that extent, I'm not entirely sure I'd make a good op
