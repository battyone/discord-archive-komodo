[09-Jun-19 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
just change the testnet.json

[09-Jun-19 11:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
it seems that i can kill my node then

[09-Jun-19 11:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
if we have CFEK testnet there's no point in having this one too

[10-Jun-19 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, I'm killing my testnet NN, it's silly to keep paying for this 😣

[11-Jun-19 12:12 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sounds like Im shutting down too then

[11-Jun-19 12:43 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I'll be shutting mine down too

[11-Jun-19 05:12 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll shut mine down too then.
Thanks @Alright and @SHossain for setting that up 🙏  And to everyone for participating and teaching me so much with your sharing and help.
You guys are awesome! :3040_kingpeepo:

we are currently testing a release candidate with the following pubkeys: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/beta/src/komodo_defs.h#L181
MAKE SURE YOUR PUBKEY IS ONE THAT YOU HAVE THE PRIVKEY FOR

@Notary-Operator plz submit a PR ASAP if you dont have privkey for the pubkey in the komodo_defs.h

[12-Jun-19 07:26 AM] jeezy#3408
can confirm

[12-Jun-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
less than 6 hours to make any final changes

[12-Jun-19 10:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
When do we need to upgrade tomorrow what time?

[12-Jun-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
2PM UTC on 13th

[12-Jun-19 10:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Thanks

[12-Jun-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
we need a full day of stable binaries to validate

[12-Jun-19 10:37 AM] Strob#3417
10-4! Pubkey OK!

Also I shut down BEER, PIZZA, TXS testnet.

[12-Jun-19 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
just rechecked that have access to my pubkey

[12-Jun-19 11:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
This bug looks pretty bad, and is a way for NN private keys to be stolen on VPS's. No mitigations, it's a hardware bug

[12-Jun-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
I would be pretty concerned if I was running a notary on a VPS that is shared with other users on the same hardware. They say they can leak OpenSSH private keys or anything else

[12-Jun-19 11:57 AM] phm87#7395
if BTC bubbles to 1000 000 and KMD higher, a huge incentive will exist about this attack-vector. Thank you dukeleto

[12-Jun-19 12:23 PM] VoskCoin#1869
its not a pubkey that I sent to @kolo

[12-Jun-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
then you need to get it fixed ASAP

[12-Jun-19 12:25 PM] kolo#1111

[12-Jun-19 12:26 PM] VoskCoin#1869
sent you a PM

[12-Jun-19 12:26 PM] VoskCoin#1869
do you also want a PR?

[12-Jun-19 12:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 there is no public exploit yet, but that should not make NN ops feel much better. Smart people will most likely develop their own just based on the description of the bug

[12-Jun-19 12:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it's a hardware bug with no software mitigation. If a public exploit does come out, that would be pretty bad for a lot of existing server hardware

[12-Jun-19 12:52 PM] kolo#1111
Please, do not bomb James or do PRs to Komodo directly. All questions about keys should be in my DM. Or bad things can happen

[12-Jun-19 12:55 PM] kolo#1111
@Notary-Operator  Here are latest keys: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/komodo_defs.h - should be final, but verify that your key is what you wanted it to be

I lost my private keys, only realised last night. Was mighty close.

[12-Jun-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Would have been a total disaster 🤣

[12-Jun-19 01:49 PM] SHossain#0007
did you find it or creating new one?

[12-Jun-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I compiled iguana on offline PowerMAC and generated new keys, ten saved them on 4  brand new USB sticks, so it cant happen again 😄

Its really weird, the USB was sitting on my desk entire year, never went missing... now its just gone, wife may have taken it when she moved out I guess

[12-Jun-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r also beware of cats

[12-Jun-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r the wife wants those NN keys 😉

[12-Jun-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
she has no idea what they are

[12-Jun-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it used to be hers before I used it... either that or I put it somehere else after too many drinks and cant rember where it is 🤣

[12-Jun-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in anycase, new keys was a much better idea.

[12-Jun-19 02:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
My last PR made to show my pubkeys on github page was never merged.

[12-Jun-19 02:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Still, I've got my season 3 pubkeys, tripled checked along with private key for accuracy

[12-Jun-19 02:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
@blackjok3r invest in a safe 😉

[12-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

btw I used that repo and this one when I set up my node. 
https://github.com/lukechilds/notary-node-utils
I also managed to get listunspent call down to `0.07s` consistetly on KMD and every assetchain even with blockchains runing on a HDD!

I think it almost removes any need for wallet and utxo management at silly limits. I can safly run hundreds of itxos without slowing anything down.

try that with what you did to my BEER wallet :troll:

which SuperNET repo you are using?

it has to be `jl777/SuperNET`

[12-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
just coming up to that step

[12-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'm at 

'Import private key into coin daemons
Important: Make sure your daemon is running and fully synced before importing any privkey. Importing key into daemon will trigger rescan which can take some time to finish depending on tx history.'

VRSC doesnt show in my stats

[12-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
still giving trouble..

[12-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so I'm still not ready to import key to it

[12-Jun-19 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`VRSC doesnt show in my stats`
because you haven't edited it for the way VRSC is now

[12-Jun-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you built verus from verus master, it no longer runs as an assetchain

[12-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
should I remove it, go back and build differently?

[12-Jun-19 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, you should script according to what it is

[12-Jun-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```time komodo-cli -ac_name=WLC listunspent | grep 0.00010000 | wc -l
1509
real    0m0.247s```
```cat test.sh
#!/bin/bash
for i in `seq 0 2000`;  do
        time komodo-cli -ac_name=WLC listunspent 1 7777 > /dev/null
done
```
ALL of the results for those 2000 listunspents are i this range: 
```real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.000s

real    0m0.007s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.000s

real    0m0.007s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.004s

real    0m0.008s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.008s
```

[12-Jun-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
works mint.

[12-Jun-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
3000% increase in listunspent speed, without needing to run any low numbers.

[12-Jun-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if I can get this working for BTC ... runnign thousands of utxos incase of mempool being full will be possible.

[12-Jun-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just need to work out how better to cal this special call, because if some user puts chain depth 7777 they wont get an actual listunspent retrun

[12-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you mean edit my local stats script?

[12-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I don't see just what I'd need to edit, sorry

[12-Jun-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just change verus-cli to verus

[12-Jun-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or soemthing like that... I had to do that.

[12-Jun-19 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I don't see just what I'd need to edit, sorry`
scroll back to me explaining this 3 times last night

[12-Jun-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is why its better to make your won scripts the first time around... I just used lukes directly, because they were based on mine from alst year only written 1000x better

[12-Jun-19 06:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
or at least try to understand them, that way you can mod them

[12-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Im working on understanding them

[12-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
still searching for precisely what Im meant to change to get the existing/known webworker stats script I'm running to ourput VRSC status.. I'm missing it.

[12-Jun-19 07:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it needs to be set up like an external (like BTC and others) and not as an assetchain

[12-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Ive not resumed to stage of guide where iguana gets installed but im about to just go ahead and proceed if the stats script is giving me errors I wouldnt have otherwise

[12-Jun-19 07:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
still clueless on VRSC mods necessary since things did not go as everyone expected and we all came to realize at once things didnt pan out for me the same way they did for all others setting up before me (going by latest guide anyways)

[12-Jun-19 07:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I assume it is running properly, I tail its debug log
