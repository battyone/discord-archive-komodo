Packages will make some detour to the african mainland till that cable to pakistan is ready

Mauritius is better connected and also has nice beaches they say

[02-Apr-19 06:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
12? ☹ that means I gotta work for it

[02-Apr-19 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can always change regions :troll:

[02-Apr-19 06:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm after I've disalbed autosplit and lowered utxos amount my node relatively skyrocketed

do we know how many of the current NN operators will run for a 2nd node / rerun ?

[02-Apr-19 06:25 AM] jorian#4555
```NA region election candidates

Alien
Chainmakers
Chainstrike
Cracker
SMK762
etszombi
lumberscout
pirate

[02-Apr-19 06:26 AM] TonyL#3577
12 candidates and 8 places?

[02-Apr-19 06:26 AM] jorian#4555
Yes

[02-Apr-19 06:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Not huge competition tho 😃

[02-Apr-19 06:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how many of those are running for a second node?

[02-Apr-19 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is thinking that maybe putting 3 options was a bad idea_

[02-Apr-19 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
etszombi ? wtf ... that was a dead node for like half of last season in EU 😕

[02-Apr-19 06:29 AM] jorian#4555
Ptyx got burned for that

[02-Apr-19 06:29 AM] jorian#4555
Better to be safe and run for 1

[02-Apr-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why I justwent for 1... cant end up that way

[02-Apr-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Could probably handle 2 no worries

[02-Apr-19 06:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, part of my hope is to create a network where it doesn't suck to be in Sydney

[02-Apr-19 06:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I recn best way to get 2 or 3 nodes, is to run for one each year for 3 years, and finish in top half every year

If nodes spread out more and dont all keep grouping in the same DC's where you are will matter less

[02-Apr-19 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ping times in syndey were nearly 3x when it came to propagation, it was like orphan city

[02-Apr-19 06:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
Pirate is going for 1 EU 1 NA

[02-Apr-19 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... Syndey has a huge number of nodes though the whole top of SH is there...

[02-Apr-19 06:32 AM] TonyL#3577
If elected I want to setup physical one in some location where no operators have servers yet. But if buy before elections kinda huge risk to end up with piece of non needed hardware

[02-Apr-19 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep... I purchased the server used it from home for testnet then when got spot found DC and went and installed it and brought storage drives last year.,

[02-Apr-19 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ressonably low risk, but used very old cheap server :abusedsmily:

[02-Apr-19 06:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I was gonna run in SH, but provider wnated 12 months paid up front. So I went NA, which is monthly. If I dont get a spot, I might hang on it it, or get rid of it. Not sure... but I have like 4 vultr VPS that I could shut down instead....

[02-Apr-19 06:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are people running VPS on the test net? Or are you required to run the actual server you will use until the elections?

[02-Apr-19 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can use VPS for either really...

[02-Apr-19 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im using a 4GB VPS in syndey but my stats are terrible

[02-Apr-19 06:42 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Can you get VPS with good enough specs though, arent there minimum requirements?

[02-Apr-19 06:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have to do VPS, my 10MB will not cut it

[02-Apr-19 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, people used them this year... AWS has VPS that scales to insane numbers, but its too expensive

[02-Apr-19 06:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Surely renting dedicated hardware would be much better.

[02-Apr-19 06:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
less coins on testnet so reasonable VPS can handle it. I'm using fullspec to testdrive it. you can do either.

[02-Apr-19 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
buying dedicated hardware is the best 😄

[02-Apr-19 06:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or that :P

[02-Apr-19 06:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Surely renting dedicated hardware would be much better.`
at about 19x the overhead cost

[02-Apr-19 06:45 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I looked into it. Its about $300 aud per month here in aus for the required specs

[02-Apr-19 06:45 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
For a dedicated machine.

[02-Apr-19 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im paying $450 a month for rack space and power for my own hardware lol :abusedsmily:

[02-Apr-19 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Apr-19 06:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Geez that is exy

[02-Apr-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
power was the killer here.... QUAD CPU server draws silly power... but the unlimited bandwidth is nice... Most DC had a cap on bandwidth this one is unlimited

[02-Apr-19 06:48 AM] mrlynch#5735
so for the post electiom testnet you don't need to run the server that will go on mainnet?

[02-Apr-19 06:48 AM] mrlynch#5735
and use a vps instead?

[02-Apr-19 06:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either

[02-Apr-19 06:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
_decided to eat rice and beans for the month and spend the rest on dedicated server_

[02-Apr-19 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this was all confusing last eyar... they said you needed he server setup before... but plenty of peopel just didnt and they still got their spot... I delayed installing server until last minute to save $$$ but I had all teh software ready to go on it months in advance

[02-Apr-19 06:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
if it was confusing last year maybe it doesn't have to be this year

Last year the hardfork was moved forward too... otherwise it was 3 months server rent for no reason waiting for hardfork... doubt thats happening this year

[02-Apr-19 06:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
if i can do the testnet with a $40 vps i'd rather not spend the $350 for the full server 😬

[02-Apr-19 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly

[02-Apr-19 06:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
and if pirate wins in both regions that would be $700 😬

the 48hr stat is best stat

[02-Apr-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is basically last .... but oit is expected using a $20 VPS (in the worst location) vs. $400-500 servers.

[02-Apr-19 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
my server was 10x price of yours (assuming AUD?), and I'm almost 10 blocks ahead :troll_hurt:

[02-Apr-19 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well we add 1 mor coin and my server is 0 😆

[02-Apr-19 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I only set it up to get the testnet started... I guess I can updrade it later on.

[02-Apr-19 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think I need to prove I can run a notary though lol

[02-Apr-19 08:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tbh, I wouldnt be doing as well if not for paying attention in LABs, so probably more to your credit than the hardware

not if you had autosplitter issues for the 1st 19

[02-Apr-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It can just fine @TonyL  You just need to make sure the I/O is good and the location is reasonable. The CPU use is liek 0, the biggest diffrence I see with much newer and more expensive hardware is that the I/O is directly connected to the CPU rather than SATA.... The actual CPU speed is moot 99.99% of the time its not even being 1% used.

[02-Apr-19 08:35 AM] TonyL#3577
I just wondering that more threads is better in case of 50+ daemons usage (not in spot of tasks heaviness on these threads but in spot of multitasking in general)

[02-Apr-19 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
More threads is better yes. 48 on my server. But only assigned 24 to notary VM in the end 48 was just crazy overkill... The more coins we get the mor important thread counts will be over single thread preformance. 
Slow single threads only draw back is waiting for daemon to sync and load.
