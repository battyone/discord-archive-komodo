Don't know if it helps, but I use vi to edit my files and it colorizes (is that a word?) the text to show open and closed "" {} and so on. If the colors mismatch somewhere then I know where to look. Thats how I found where to fix my IP problems in m_notary_testnet last night

[14-Apr-19 10:38 AM] newvulcan#4719
By the way, I did a git stash afterwards to get m_notary_testnet to restart - is that the right way to do it ?

[14-Apr-19 10:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
check yo slashes

[14-Apr-19 10:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and other syntax. colorising makes it simple

[14-Apr-19 10:40 AM] And1_89#6578
but i didn't edit the m_notary_testenet how can there be a syntax error there?

[14-Apr-19 10:40 AM] phm87#7395
A previous commit had a synthax pb

[14-Apr-19 10:40 AM] mrlynch#5735
@And1_89 edit m_notary_testnet -> comment out # git pull and check to make sure you have all the " escaped with a \ there were 2 lines missing that .. where the ip's are listed

woulda got to sleep earlier, but had to wait for the moon to be at the right azimuth

[14-Apr-19 11:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
my node was offline for about 8hrs while I tried things, then tried other things.

[14-Apr-19 11:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
each change I gave time to evaluate, which is why so long. I recon poking so much too fast only causes problems

[14-Apr-19 11:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and disabled cron when testing, else it might have interfered

[14-Apr-19 11:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, poking to fast ain't good.
I would have waited for a romantic moon and to check the azimuth, but I forgot my sextent.

[14-Apr-19 11:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I spent a few minutes in the sextent, but it got too kinky

Btw ... i wish somehow support newcomers, so, i offer a small bounty from my personal funds for the best **Testnet 2019** node https://notarystats.info/testnet.php . Rules are simple, who will be #1 at **21.04** in the testnet stats will receive following rewards from me:
```
- 5000 RFOX
- 1000 VRSC
- 100 KMD

p.s. May be i will offer some additional prizes for #2 and #3 place. But for now only #1 will have guaranteed prize!
