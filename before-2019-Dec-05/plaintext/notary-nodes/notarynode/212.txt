@blackjok3r @SHossain GIN has txindex=1 by default, like KMD

[30-May-19 07:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r @SHossain actually I think i am wrong, must be confusing with another coin

[30-May-19 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think it's actually more subtle

[30-May-19 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
GIN is a masternode coin, and the mn features require txindex=1

[30-May-19 07:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have added dpow to so many coins that i can't remember the specifics of each anymore

found it! that is the conf they told me to use, with txindex=1

[30-May-19 07:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
so even tho their codebase defaults to txindex=0, none of their stuff works without it. they set it manually

[30-May-19 07:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r @SHossain TLDR, you only need to care about txindex=1 for emc2

trying to figure out why my node isn't doing much for  COQUI .   I notice that the node only has one incoming connection, and  that a good percent of the outgoing connections aren't synched  fully       ./komodo-cli -ac_name=COQUI getpeerinfo

[30-May-19 11:43 PM] NNoperator#3835
Seven of my peers are stuck in the 776 area,  not a very clean consensus...

I can list IPs if that would help

[31-May-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK so I just nerd to fix gin without txindex and all 3rd party are good to roll.

[31-May-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can't do this until next week but that gives duke some time to get emc2 right, and kolo to finalise pubkeys.

@mrlynch I'll need like a day to devote to it, kind of slammed atm

I actually did ask a while back about needing new Pubkey and when but didnt get certain response, missed announce last week pparently

i'm getting new pubkeys generated ASAP

I can create new kmd keys on ledger nano s if preferable..

[31-May-19 09:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
then i have to dump privkey manually though right?

[31-May-19 09:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
better to just use agama on OSX?

@Dr.Terminus  a message was written by kolo but new NN operators were not notified I think (I read the message later). I am doing the whole NN setup but keys can be generated on a separate server/VM (you can generate keys on one server and do the whole NN setup later), here is the link to generate keys:

I'd prefer to have all coins and AC running to be able to verify that the WIF works (importprivkey then validateaddress) but reliable NN op told me that the tool of decker is reliable

CG is correct : the message is in the #notarynode-announce channel but new notary nodes that do not have the Notary-Operator discord tag were not notified

[31-May-19 11:01 PM] phm87#7395
@Dr.Terminus  I sent my 2 pubkeys to kolo. I think that we should write a little text about us in a form (for marketing) that I saw somewhere, the aim is to present us as NN

[31-May-19 11:08 PM] phm87#7395
the explanation and link is also available in the #notarynode-announce channel

install iguana from supernet repo, good practise.
run iguana, initialize a coin, you've probably already got one runnign somewhere, just use `~/SuperNET/iguana/coins/morty_7776` as an example
 `walletpassphrase` or `encryptwallet` with a super duper long and secure passphrase, and the curl response output of `btcpubkey` is what you submit.
all pubkeys are used in public as is.
