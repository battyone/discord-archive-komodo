it's safer to run the API on an internal-only network, and also ask other trusted peers. Any mismatch in API responses for a given txid should alert a human, something fishy is going on

That s what a packaged version would do.

Up to the admin to filter anything

[13-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Seeing it as : run this image on a vmware / virt and filter everything you need before releasing it internally

[13-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or leave it as is to auto add a public query node

[13-Sep-18 08:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
vmware is a pretty heavy dependency

[13-Sep-18 08:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
docker would be much cleaner

Docker would be the best choice IMO

while using 
```
bitcoin-cli sendmany "ACCOUNTLABEL" "{\"${REMOTEADDRESS}\":\"$(bitcoin-cli get-balance)\"}"
```
 I see this which makes sense because I'm trying to send the whole balance and not deduct the fees from it:
```
error code: -6
error message:
Insufficient funds
```

how can I choose an optimum amount (so I'm not paying too much but not waiting for too long for the transaction)?

[15-Sep-18 12:47 PM] ns408#8889
Would it be sufficient to reduce the amount I'm trying to send by `0.0001`?

[15-Sep-18 01:16 PM] ns408#8889
Can't use sendtoaddress as I have got two accounts on the same system.

As for sendmany subtracting the fee option, I have read it in the man pages but how are you guys calculating that value?
To make things a bit more clear, let me present the scenario:

- bitcoin  wallet has got two accounts on a single machine
- one account has zero balance (account a)
- the other account labelled 'temp' has 0.1 in it. (account b)
- now when sending funds from (account b) to a third party account, how would you calculate it?

If you haven't tried using sendmany before, it won't be clear.

[15-Sep-18 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
accounts are also deprecated

[15-Sep-18 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
BTC core deleted them, and they are frowned upon to use in Zcash and Zcash forks, because much of the code is disabled/deprecated/bitrotten, fyi

I was looking at the code @blackjok3r , it looks small, but depends on a lot of other code that allows customizing wallet locations

[15-Sep-18 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, yes, we should merge that to KMD

Hi, what incentives do notary nodes get to operate their nodes? Other than the 300k KMD paid to them per year, do the notary nodes get anything else for this?

[18-Sep-18 06:50 PM] kolo#1111
Notaries get easy diff on mining. Nothing but that.

[18-Sep-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
also it is more like 20K KMD per year,not 300K

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] joey#9690
Okay, so KMD notary nodes get:
- 20k KMD per year,
- Easier difficulty on mining (what is the exact amount that difficulty is reduced for them?)

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] joey#9690
Okay

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] joey#9690
I don't mean to be negative / FUD, but some concerns raised by my team and the others I've introduced this solution to, is that the notary nodes need to have some incentive to: 
1. Not provide incorrect data
2. Pay for DDOS protection and general maint/uptime

[18-Sep-18 07:05 PM] joey#9690
I see, but the reward for running a node is around 300 KMD a year (20,000 / 64), is that correct? Or is it 20k KMD per year per node?

[18-Sep-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
per node

[18-Sep-18 07:05 PM] joey#9690
Okay, that makes a lot more sense

[18-Sep-18 07:05 PM] joey#9690
That reward is issued through block rewards on KMD?

[18-Sep-18 07:05 PM] joey#9690
(via lower difficulty)

[18-Sep-18 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[18-Sep-18 07:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
@joey 

Each notary node's pubkey is hardcoded into the consensus rules to allow us to mine at a low difficulty; which when mining 24/7/365 equates to roughly 20k KMD a year in mining rewards.

There are 64 notaries spread geographically across 4 regions (16 notaries per region). Only the top 8 nodes with the most notarisations from each region will keep their positions next year. The bottom 8 will lose their position and will have to campaign to be re-elected along with any other member of the public.

The incentive is to keep the position. There is quite a lot of competition between the operators coming up with all sorts of insane optimisations to try and increase their notarisation counts.

Im checking out about adding HUSH to iguana

[20-Sep-18 02:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Out of curiosity, how do the notary nodes defend against the spectre and meltdown attacks?

Also, what about the Intel ME?

[20-Sep-18 04:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
By keeping system updated

[20-Sep-18 04:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It‚Äôs still not guaranteed to be secure

[20-Sep-18 04:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There is no definitive solution to these vulnerabilities unless a processor is changed

[20-Sep-18 04:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And there is no processor immune to it
If m not wrong

[20-Sep-18 04:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Only low end old processors

[20-Sep-18 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Bryan_Beus  I just used a CPU so old that its not vunreable to them....

[20-Sep-18 10:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@grewalsatinder 

I hear sys76 disabled the ME, as did a few other privacy and FOSS-oriented laptop makers.

But I also hear that it's only a deterrent.

@blackjok3r 

g2k.

I was wondering about this. 

There was some news I read not long ago about some open-source CPUs that are on the horizon, but they were around $10K each...

[20-Sep-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I usd the last of the Opterons from A64 days, as far as I know there is some small Spectre exploit but thats fixed in OS level, so far none of the "security" updates have applied to my server.

[20-Sep-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
