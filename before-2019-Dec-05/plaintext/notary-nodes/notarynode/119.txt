has anyone had success on BEER using `importprivkey <WIF> "" false` then re-funding the node?

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
or does listunspent just break no matter what after some time

{Reactions}
✌ 

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
what does `break` mean in this context?

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
@Alright i did that just yesterday 👌

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have done that a few times

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
it's empty

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
shouldn't be

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Listunspent requires confirmations

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Alright  yes I did success

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
but i consolidated on a 2nd node right after the attack

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you use false, you aren't rescanning, and listunspent won't have data

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
need to rescan to have listunspent know stuff

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
and i merge/consolidate on a regular basis

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
then re-funding the node

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto ^

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
so listunspent never shows data, even after refunding? That is weird

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
No it's fine for a while

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
I would make sure that you have the correct "account", just in case

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
then breaks

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
interesting

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If u can reproduce this exactly I can look at it

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Never seenbit happen here

[12-Apr-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
non-deterministic listunspent sound scary

[12-Apr-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesn't seem possible but who knows

[12-Apr-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
perhaps something is spending all your funds, like an autosplit cron, and the funds are sitting unconfirmed for a while

[12-Apr-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wait

[12-Apr-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe I know what that may be

[12-Apr-19 11:27 AM] CHMEX#0686
I mean getnewaddress would be the same

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
pretty much

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Whenbu start the daemon... Does it print that tx are expired?

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
no

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are pools of addresses internally

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
nothing in mempool

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
from my node at least

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
getnewaddress addresses are slightly different than change addresses, for instance

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
mostly only in internals, you can ignore at RPC layer, usually

[12-Apr-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is one bug ewith the wallet, where when it rescans on daemon load, it tries to addntx to mempool, and they fail the contextual check due to being expired and may be deleted from the wallet.

[12-Apr-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I fixed this on labs but not sure

[12-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
yes I've seen that, but it's not the case here

[12-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
I can reliably reproduce this on my node right now. I've been fixing it every couple hours for past couple days 😂

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
tell me what to test and I will

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright can you make it happen on regtest?

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
give me a failing test

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
I haven't tried to make it happen

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol... I'm not sure what to test... But if u can give me the wallet maybrni can debug it

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
so maybe "reliably reproduce" isn't what I'm doing 😛

[12-Apr-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Are unusing wallet filter?

[12-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
no

"Are you using crazy LABS features from the future?" - Doc

[12-Apr-19 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hahah not since the large merge when we knew labs was 99% stable has anything been merged

[12-Apr-19 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`"Are you using crazy LABS features from the future?" `
I had issues where labs iguana would refuse connections on startup and I switched back to the "official" test repo

[12-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
do not use LABS iguana

[12-Apr-19 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mr lynch is running my iguana in gbd right now, to try and track that down, my advice is to notnuse labs iguana right now, or black test branch.. A-team is using it and is sucking... But to find the "stops notarizing after 8 days" bug I need tondo these things

[12-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
there's a difference between joker's iguana and LABS iguana

[12-Apr-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Momom is using 5 block offset on labs

[12-Apr-19 11:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`do not use LABS iguana`
It was a specific purposeful build

[12-Apr-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will not reach consensus on mainnet

[12-Apr-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can't hurt anything but it won't notarize

[12-Apr-19 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it worked when you told me to use it 😛

[12-Apr-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes there is one or 2/commits that work perfectly as rocket iguanas

[12-Apr-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But ifbu update fro. that branch maybe no the case, or isn't

[12-Apr-19 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that branch worked great when it worked, but I dunno what the startup issue was and with so many restarts back then I just ditched it

[12-Apr-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It crashes

[12-Apr-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need back trace @mrlynch  is doing it for me right now

[12-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419

refunded it via 8c6b1a06a1f329812cacf9a9d42e1b76580fc15592b19bae0a724855e1eb485f tx 
this gets confirmed but listunspent was empty until 
`dc1e8a563aff1b308a209ae4faee19d580f90c930377326adcff7eabcd06b564` was confirmed which is a split tx that my node didn't have in mempool prior to the restart

[12-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
so listunspent should not have been empty after 8c6b.... confirmed

[12-Apr-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So the first tx is not being added to walletl?

[12-Apr-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or the cron utxo splitter is spending it rightaway

[12-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419

restart seems to have made listunspent show up

[12-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
still something majorly wonky about this, should not have had an empty listunspent

listunspent seems to be off on my BEER too (that or cleaner is)
I sent full balance to myself twice, then split and still have:
```JSON
BEER
{
  "total_transactons": 9,
  "remaining_transactons": 9,
  "removed_transactions": 0
}```
but only the split UTXOs showing in listunspent
all other chains are
```JSON
{
  "total_transactons": 1,
  "remaining_transactons": 1,
  "removed_transactions": 0
}```

[12-Apr-19 11:51 AM] zatJUM#9924
I had many issues too using a new wallet and having imported pivkey without rescanning

I'm consolidating previous wallet on another machine...

[12-Apr-19 11:57 AM] gt#2812
@Alright  i’ve had a similar issue.

[12-Apr-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I'm following properly the issue is that the change is not returned to the wallet as an unspent when not using the wallet filter? Is this the correct  description?

[12-Apr-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But only on beer?

[12-Apr-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Very strange

[12-Apr-19 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It might be some of the UTXOs that ended up 0 value that are "stuck" and only a full zap will fix (I might try that later)

[12-Apr-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is an exception in the wallet that coinbase with no value are not added

[12-Apr-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't see how that would apply to a non coinbase tho

[12-Apr-19 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
247k UTXOs do wonky things

[12-Apr-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The wallet is not designed to handle that

[12-Apr-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But rewriting it to do so is almost impossible

[12-Apr-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Changing to leveldb for wallet means also uncant clear tx

[12-Apr-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, that's why I figure I'll take the stats hit to be sure, it could be a nothing that's just wonky in the db

[12-Apr-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a problem inherited from.btc

[12-Apr-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
surely not
