Not much, nothing changed, except if you don't look inside demo scripts

[26-Mar-19 02:21 AM] kolo#1111
All pull requests to NN repo merged. Giving 2-3 days before merging proven to help to avoid/fix mistakes üòÉ

[26-Mar-19 02:21 AM] kolo#1111
I will keep that practice

[26-Mar-19 02:27 AM] PTYX#6840
if i dont know which demo scripts i need to be looking at, it's sort of guessing

[26-Mar-19 02:28 AM] PTYX#6840
we also have to think about the new notaries, not only the ones that can dig through the scripts.

[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] Strob#3417
Maybe I could help to update the guide since I just trhough all of it and I  took notes all along. For example we need Linux 16.04 lts mini and bitcoin  16.3 installed in opt directory. We also need to add the part about installing the game wif.

[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] kolo#1111
Game was in a separate manual

[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] PTYX#6840
@Strob that would be greawt

[26-Mar-19 02:35 AM] kolo#1111
Why /opt?

[26-Mar-19 02:35 AM] kolo#1111
@Strob Please, don't change structure without review. DM me what you want to fix first

[26-Mar-19 02:36 AM] Strob#3417
ok yes sure

[26-Mar-19 02:37 AM] PTYX#6840
Do we even need to use the basilisk.old anymore?

[26-Mar-19 02:41 AM] Strob#3417
I put it in opt cause it's an older version so we can't install it from the repo. And since it's a third party app already built, shouldn't it go to opt?

[26-Mar-19 02:42 AM] PTYX#6840
can i get a link to the incumbent notaries?

[26-Mar-19 02:42 AM] PTYX#6840
and the nodes they are running? i can't find it on google

the election site does not sync with the github repo yet

[26-Mar-19 02:53 AM] Mylo#8306
so any updates won't be reflected

good luck this year @PTYX

[26-Mar-19 02:55 AM] PTYX#6840
same to you guys

[26-Mar-19 02:55 AM] Mylo#8306
tl;dr; the top 7 in each region are auto-relected, leaving 32 spots up for grabs

[26-Mar-19 02:59 AM] PTYX#6840
I see a few 0 scores on the list. Wouldn't it make sense to prevent those operators from re-running and bring in some new blood?

[26-Mar-19 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think ppl who are on 0 dont want a node anyway lol

[26-Mar-19 03:01 AM] PTYX#6840
but they probably have KMD and some have ran twice from what i am able to see

[26-Mar-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meshbits says not running, emmanaux has libscotts node I think and said not running... batman and badass not sure, but who in their right mind would vote for them üòõ

[26-Mar-19 03:02 AM] PTYX#6840
if the point is to secure the network then it can be counter intuitive to encourage 0 score re-elections.

[26-Mar-19 03:02 AM] PTYX#6840
batman and badass......yeah they don't show up too much around here

[26-Mar-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think letting anyone run is fine.... Its clear to voters who does a bad job, as they can look at the website... Guess maybe a second source of info would be good just to verify that site is right.

[26-Mar-19 03:03 AM] PTYX#6840
that leaves the door open to whales electing themselves and not performing though

[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe that's a rule for next year, it's been 12 months for suggested rule changes and improvements to process.   will not be done at last minute.

it is a good suggestion though.

[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] PTYX#6840
yes of course not, next year üòÑ

[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
theres one way to fix that, and thats to pay per notarization üòÑ I made a solution for that, but it totally destroys coin emission becuse notarizations are random not fixed like blocks.

[26-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Mylo#8306
we've already had the internal "you've had all year to make suggestions" debate between marketing & tech.   sorry, has to be within 6 months to give everyone optics on the problem/solution.

[26-Mar-19 03:06 AM] PTYX#6840
so there have been no recommendations to improve the notary election process all year?

[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changing things too much for KMD iteself is a bad idea.... It should work ok, as long as voters are not stupid

[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Mylo#8306
no z voting, no vote buying, one or two other minor changes and suggestions and the election website.

[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] PTYX#6840
no vote buying. i'm not sure how you can prevent that

[26-Mar-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean sone voted for me lol... and I had no idea what I was doing... but probably did the most work out of any OP this season. Was a lot to learn, but its about giving people a go until you get the ebst team you can. Until we find these people, someone has to make up the spots.

[26-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Mylo#8306
the campaigning vote-buying, with airdropped kmd from mining rewards.  this is not allowed.  off-chain, cannot police.

[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] PTYX#6840
we should then put a pin on whale re-election prevention for the next round

[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] PTYX#6840
and low performance re-election

[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
speical vote chain could have been made, but youc ant prevent off chain buying of votes so it was decided not to worry about it....

[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS solution is to cull the botton 25% of nodes... so average notarizations is 2000, you have to amke 500 to be allwoed to stay.

[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Mylo#8306
but what's to stop a whle going to another team etc.   it's a hard thing to police

[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
People still wont liek that though as when all nodes are doigna  good job there is 0 chance for entry by anyone

[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] PTYX#6840
are notaries able to run nodes in whatever region they want? and can they have multiple nodes in one region?

[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Mylo#8306
1 per region

[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] PTYX#6840
or is there a link to the rules of this round?

[26-Mar-19 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems the website says youc an have multiple poer region to me

[26-Mar-19 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
clear change of rules unless I missread it

[26-Mar-19 03:11 AM] PTYX#6840
i haven't read it. link please

[26-Mar-19 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```

Individuals may run for as many open Notary Node positions as they wish. For example, someone may choose to run for all 8 open positions in a single region, while another individual may choose to run for 2 open positions in each of the four regions. Both are acceptable.```

[26-Mar-19 03:13 AM] PTYX#6840
So can I just have one voting address, and then spread my vote in the regions i'd want?

[26-Mar-19 03:13 AM] PTYX#6840
if it doesn't really matter where i run them, i should be able to spread out my votes as i wish

[26-Mar-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IU'm pretty sure I know why that was changed... and I agree to it somewat. It allows people to use their own actual servers where they live, than being forced to rent overseas

[26-Mar-19 03:14 AM] Mylo#8306
no i think one spend on the vote.   will clarify by april 1 on website, i'll pass onto the election website team (which i'm on)

[26-Mar-19 03:14 AM] Mylo#8306

Still only running for a single spot here... no use diluting votes

[26-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Mylo#8306
when z-voting was there you could allocate to wherver but i think the validation is the vote is only spent once, cannot shuffle

[26-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Mylo#8306
but will have an answer on website

[26-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Mylo#8306
any other Qs plz mention me,

[26-Mar-19 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. We decided that ac_public meant we can look at the votes on chain after the fact and ban cheaters... It was possible to make aspeical chain, but not worht the effort

[26-Mar-19 03:17 AM] PTYX#6840
I think more than anything there needs to be an updated, easy to follow guide for the new notary candidates

[26-Mar-19 03:18 AM] PTYX#6840
that would be great if it can be put on the website as well.

[26-Mar-19 03:18 AM] PTYX#6840
the more visibility for the new candidates the better

[26-Mar-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, I will make one, but tbh ... doing things the "offical" way will get you a useless node that cant compete.. Most good OPs wrote all thier own scripts and solutions to run a node.

[26-Mar-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I even modified the ntoarizer itself in the end... a LOT lol

[26-Mar-19 03:19 AM] PTYX#6840
well, it does depend on the wanted outcome of the elections. if it's to keep everything in-house and very exclusive then that's fine.

[26-Mar-19 03:21 AM] Mylo#8306
as with any election, there's goinig to be things that can be done better, the aim is to set a better standard than last year as foundation for next year.   hence the "more notice for improvements & suggestions" given the other work going on

[26-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Mylo#8306
the website, that will be updated by april 1, and again, this can be improved upon next year.

[26-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Mylo#8306
if it doesn't deliver this year etc. etc.

[26-Mar-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
Going to start gathering pubkeys/IPs for a testnet, please PM these to me if you wish to participate immediately. After the initial setup, I'll setup a fork of SuperNet repo in which new participants can PR their pubkey/IP to.

What does everyone want to notarize? a TXSCL*** chain would be simplest, but it could be anything

[26-Mar-19 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do PIZZA

[26-Mar-19 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its already in the code

[26-Mar-19 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do we want to use the new iguana in testnet?

[26-Mar-19 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or the old broken one?

[26-Mar-19 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
lol

[26-Mar-19 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
whatever will be in master eventually

[26-Mar-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
think iguana is using dev branch of supernet... I do need to make a PR it does seem to work fine from the 3 nodes who have tested it.

[26-Mar-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
surprised more ppl havent tried it...

[26-Mar-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r do you have enough BEER and PIZZA for everyone?

[26-Mar-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[26-Mar-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
not sure I have any myself

[26-Mar-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
ok cool

[26-Mar-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
beer definatly, pizza I think its might be in a few address but I should be able to find it

[26-Mar-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
def have 100k at least of both

[26-Mar-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419

[26-Mar-19 03:31 AM] Mylo#8306
old broken iguana still works, stop fudding

[26-Mar-19 03:31 AM] Mylo#8306

[26-Mar-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really need the new one tested properly  before the change over

[26-Mar-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess we will know in a fwe days when LABS changes era

[26-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Mylo#8306
oh ok...  that is a nicer way to put it

[26-Mar-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
problem seems to be that diffrent servers react diffrently to diffret timings....

[26-Mar-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it may be up to each OP to modify those to get the best params

[26-Mar-19 03:34 AM] Mylo#8306
ah, the old 'don't move the server, the dust is keeping it running' principle

[26-Mar-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well I found that you can just speed up the whoel notarizer ... rather than buy a faster server üòõ
