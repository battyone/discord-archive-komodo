no notarizations yet..

[15-Apr-19 10:15 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
occurs to me I have not opened p2p ports for each coin or port 17711 for iguana.. This must be done on any/all vps hosts ?

[15-Apr-19 10:15 PM] phm87#7395
I don't remember if it is mandatory to open ports for coins but I think it is required for iguana

[15-Apr-19 10:16 PM] phm87#7395
but the readme of 2018NNtestnet repo of Alright says to open p2p ports of everything

[15-Apr-19 10:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders why it's called "readme" 🤔_

[15-Apr-19 10:23 PM] phm87#7395
indeed

[15-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thought it had to be done in fail2ban

[15-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no?

[15-Apr-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```Fail2ban scans log files (e.g. /var/log/apache/error_log) and bans IPs that show the malicious signs -- too many password failures, seeking for exploits, etc.```

[15-Apr-19 10:25 PM] newvulcan#4719
Are you using ufw @Dr.Terminus  ? Was recommended to me and way better than using iptables to control the firewall. I used getinfo for every chain, made a note of the rcp and p2p ports and allowed them through. There's also a post somewhere on this thread with them listed - have a search for ufw

[15-Apr-19 10:25 PM] phm87#7395
@Lumbi  did you open the port for KMD ?

Don't forget to allow the ports for bitcoind etc

[15-Apr-19 10:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no need to run bitcoind for testnet

[15-Apr-19 10:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't open RCP ports either ;)

[15-Apr-19 10:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
@phm87 I only have those 4 and it works :troll_hardcore:

My testnet has no firewall 😂

[15-Apr-19 10:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Way out on top last 6h, but didn't restart, yet

[15-Apr-19 10:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Think it's time to try a new location, London clearly makes things too easy

[15-Apr-19 10:32 PM] newvulcan#4719
Not that it makes much of a difference to my server load, but tis good to know I don't need bitcoind running

[15-Apr-19 10:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
May as well really at least it keeps it in sync lol,bitcoin doesn't use much anyway

[15-Apr-19 10:33 PM] phm87#7395
Hi @blackjok3r  I'm happy to see you. If you have other small easy tasks to enhance KMD, please feel free to let me know (I added a help message for -whitelistaddress= into jl repo)

[15-Apr-19 10:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I saw that thanks, nice work. Right now I think everything I'm doing is involved, and seems maybe most of the bugs ATM are caused by changes I've made or been asked to make, so I think I should fix them :abusedsmily:

[15-Apr-19 10:35 PM] phm87#7395
ok but I can help to document or easy dev tasks (very easy we'll say), no emergency but I'd be happy to help

`Don't open RCP ports either ;)`
or do and post user and pass so we can play with your wallet remotely :troll:

[15-Apr-19 10:37 PM] newvulcan#4719
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 hmm, yes you do have a point, might as well not have the firewall running if I've got those open

[15-Apr-19 10:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Like I said not firewall here but i set my node up inna hurry and am using it for testing all kinds of stupid things

[15-Apr-19 10:42 PM] phm87#7395
for most of the coins I've played with, a remote machine cannot access a coin RPC of another machine except if rpcallowip of the remote machine is into the coin.conf (or as parameter). I though it was the same for komodo. I play a lot with this because my pool is on several VM on several servers

[15-Apr-19 10:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` a remote machine cannot access a coin RPC of another machine except if rpcallowip`
that doesn't stop the scripts that people blindly run

[15-Apr-19 10:45 PM] phm87#7395
indeed a malicious script can trick such things

[15-Apr-19 10:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
think if how many scripts have been run in this test that tell your wallet to send coins

[15-Apr-19 10:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Generally unless the port is listening a firewall doesn't do a lot, its more a backup I think incse u accidentally installed Apache like in my labs node

[15-Apr-19 10:46 PM] phm87#7395
quite a lot but kmd and coins are on an isolated VM

[15-Apr-19 10:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
isolated or not, I posted a script that creates, signs, and sends coins via raw commands and would be surprised if more than 50% of the people that ran it even looked at what it did before running it

{Reactions}
💯 🙈 

[15-Apr-19 10:49 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't use your script but I read its beginning

[15-Apr-19 10:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and from a security perspective, running the labs scripts without reading them is even more dangerous (given how at least one of them calls 2 or 3 others)

[15-Apr-19 10:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Years ago, my friend created a small mod for minecraft that had a script in it that sent him all their account details. I think he said he got about 2000 account login details.

[15-Apr-19 10:55 PM] phm87#7395
I use vmware regularly and VirtualBox sometimes. Next virtualization thing to learn is Proxmod

[15-Apr-19 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I'm using kmv/qemu at home now the server is still.on VMware. Thinking about changing it to proxmox but it appears my exsi bugged out, I'm 100 days uptime on all VMs ATM, and the trial still says it has 60 days left guess same as last time if I need to restart host trial will need a reset but apart from that its working great. Lol

[15-Apr-19 10:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Why pay

[15-Apr-19 10:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Haha

[15-Apr-19 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_walks over to joker's box and says "did you mean __this__ reset button?" 👇🏽_

[15-Apr-19 10:59 PM] phm87#7395
I'm also playing with trial things and free stuff of exsi but I heard so good stuff about proxmod that I am convinced now (but I also know that I will start from zero)

[15-Apr-19 11:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I think I have the possibility to switch but it will take much time which I'm low on right now. Haha I reset the host once this year and it totally broke the whole server trial ran out, and it tooke me nearly 2 days to work out how to reset it without reinstalling esxi

[15-Apr-19 11:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Very stressful lol

[15-Apr-19 11:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
usually ~ how long before seeing first NOTR ?

[15-Apr-19 11:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once everyone updated usually maybe a day?

[15-Apr-19 11:02 PM] phm87#7395
maybe take a backup of VM at a point (or just private keys if you are in a hurry)

[15-Apr-19 11:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmm the way my server works it setup I think it will be a few days downtime. Likely to keep VMware tbh and just make a new notary node VM.

Man what's wrong with me tried early night got 3h sleep hahaha

[15-Apr-19 11:06 PM] phm87#7395
I have a NN noob question about the IP : my IP that is hardcoded into github, should it be the IP of iguana and/or KMD and/or AC ? (I don't care about how to trick iguana, I already have one idea without changing its code) I think that this IP must the the IP of iguana but not necessary for the nodes but I am not sure

[15-Apr-19 11:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Iguana, my testnet IP is not on github BTW.

[15-Apr-19 11:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[15-Apr-19 11:07 PM] phm87#7395
how could it work without your IP ? I don't understand

It shares them anyway, I've tried to say this a few times...

[15-Apr-19 11:08 PM] phm87#7395
I hope that this problem doesn't exist on mainet of NN

[15-Apr-19 11:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not a problem. You may have better connectivity if you put IP on git but as long as u connect to about 4 nodes, that have the IP public it works just fine

[15-Apr-19 11:10 PM] phm87#7395
not a huge problem though if it is only the IP and not an additionnal NN

[15-Apr-19 11:10 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you

[15-Apr-19 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Can be problems. When u change  the IP, but even then, not really

[15-Apr-19 11:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will move my node some sillyplace today with no IP update and see what happenes

[15-Apr-19 11:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Bet its fine

[15-Apr-19 11:15 PM] phm87#7395
Can you confirm that this testnet of NN will continue until (at least) the end of elections ?

[15-Apr-19 11:22 PM] kolo#1111
IP problem should be solved long ago, back to the times when only 1-2 seeds needed

[15-Apr-19 11:38 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the testnet can theoretically continue as long as there are enough people running it

[15-Apr-19 11:39 PM] phm87#7395
