do we need 1TH?

[08-Aug-18 01:26 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôm not sure exactly what‚Äôs needed. From what I understand the profit switching pools will come back in force and overpower

[08-Aug-18 01:28 AM] Mylo#8306
ah right...then pump the difficulty and we are still with not much hashpower to move the chain...

[08-Aug-18 01:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly... if we bring the difficulty down low enough that its profitable to mine, the mystery asshole will come and break the difficulty until its too high for him to profit.

[08-Aug-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need just enough hash on it, thats its not profitable to mine, which means.... we lose money üò¶

just needs a CPU algo IMO. But That could be super difficult to actually do.

[08-Aug-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at some point the BR will be so low, nodody will mine it though, may just need to wait it out

No UTXO's guys

[08-Aug-18 11:24 AM] ns408#8889
thanks @blackjok3r

Any change in utxo values for any of the assets?

[08-Aug-18 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no, just that we started mining them all... Without a custom split script iguana auto split will fail.

[08-Aug-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I suggest reseting all wallets as that will send the balance to yourself. Then set up one of the scripts someone has shared to split on cron. You can leave iguana to auto split, but if it fails, at least you have a backup

[08-Aug-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Running something like mine, required daily checking as it can stop working because fo such low reverve utxo numbers.

[08-Aug-18 12:29 PM] ns408#8889
>no, just that we started mining them all... 
Okay.

>Without a custom split script iguana auto split will fail.

We are using a custom autosplit script which checks for utxos every hour: https://github.com/Meshbits/komodo_scripts/blob/master/bin/misc/cron_recharge_utxos.sh

All of those blocks have gone to external miners

[09-Aug-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@jl777c can you just confirm what UTXO type iguana needs?

[09-Aug-18 03:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
is it P2PK only

[09-Aug-18 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
p2pk for notarization, p2pkh for splitfunds

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
so splitfunds will take in p2pkh inputs and give p2pk outputs right?

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] lukechilds#2707

I'm launching a new chain tomorrow to incentivize testing. 
http://pad.supernet.org/staked
Post an address there, you will receive an equal amount from the initial premine as everyone else. The plan is to snapshot/airdrop every 6 days with 1 day in between.(testing different params each week) If you find a bug or break the chain, you will receive extra coins from the premine of the new chain. We will continually do this until we arrive at a stable chain, and this stable chain will live on as STAKED.(name up for discussion)
premine will be distributed at 3 PM GMT, pay attention to the POSTEST64 channel in the CHIPS discord if you're interested
If anyone has ideas for test scenarios we could do, please let me know

[14-Aug-18 07:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
one small suggestion

[14-Aug-18 07:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
It might be good to have two scales

[14-Aug-18 07:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
AC scale on the left

[14-Aug-18 07:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
and BTC scale on the right

[14-Aug-18 07:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
that way you can scale the BTC scores up to take full advantage of the space on the graph

[14-Aug-18 07:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
at the moment it's quite hard to see fluctuations in the BTC score because they're so small relative to the AC score

[14-Aug-18 07:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
@webworker01 does that make sense?

[14-Aug-18 07:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
also, are we able to go back further than 30 days?

[14-Aug-18 07:33 PM] lukechilds#2707

you're on fire man

[14-Aug-18 07:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, would be great if the BTC and AC lines matched

[14-Aug-18 07:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
but no biggie

[14-Aug-18 07:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
haha

[14-Aug-18 07:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
you're doing a great job

[14-Aug-18 07:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
for the dates, would be super cool if you could do something like`?from=2018-08-13&to=2018-06-13`

[14-Aug-18 07:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
and also, final final thing I promise, if there was another page to view all notaries notary stats together

[14-Aug-18 07:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
but this is awesome

but for notarisation stats

[14-Aug-18 07:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
it is a bit hard to see what's going on if everythings good

[14-Aug-18 07:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
