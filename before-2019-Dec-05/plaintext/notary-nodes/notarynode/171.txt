I finally managed to get my node back to more than 30 not within 6 hours. I removed all the unnecessary settings in .conf to get back to the most simple one (I was trying to see if I could force more ram usage to help but it didn't). Yesterday I also shrank my wallets so it may have helped too.

[26-Apr-19 12:03 AM] NNoperator#3835
Here is a perpetual transactions block that @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  was expecting to see.   UTXO splitfund  and Notarization (consuming 100% of split! ) all in the same BEER block.   This is a pointless and Sisyphean.   Please fix this, it is pointless waste.   https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/block/00008203f442acfedf531ae8dd43de25fbcb9e299a91849f927c34d2c48e61d9

@NNoperator just on general principle I'm going to go back to mining asset chains (even at the current market loss), because you just don't get it

[26-Apr-19 12:06 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
it's none of your dam'd business how someone else chooses to spend their funds

[26-Apr-19 12:06 AM] NNoperator#3835
mining serves a purpose,  splittingfunds for  1 UTXO does not.  I am sorry you miss my point

[26-Apr-19 12:06 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
what purpose does mining empty blocks serve that transactions don't?

[26-Apr-19 12:07 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
10 blocks is 10 blocks

[26-Apr-19 12:07 AM] NNoperator#3835
one is necessary the other is needless and wasteful

[26-Apr-19 12:07 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
10 empty blocks vs 9 empty blocks and 1 with 1 tx
what's the difference?

[26-Apr-19 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
to a NN, *none*

[26-Apr-19 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
who's property is it?

[26-Apr-19 06:30 AM] jorian#4555
it is the property of the chain that wants to be notarized

[26-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
they should be responsible for making sure all nodes have UTXOs then

[26-Apr-19 06:31 AM] jorian#4555
since they send a yearly fee of 365 or 800 COIN (that number keeps changing somehow) to kolo in order for it to be distributed among NN

[26-Apr-19 06:31 AM] jorian#4555
why would a chain be concerned with splitting UTXOs when they pay for the service

[26-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
really the only coin this matters for is BTC

[26-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
I can understand the concerns there, but we're talking about pennies otherwise

[26-Apr-19 07:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian it depends on txfee, GAME is 3000 because of their txfee for example

[26-Apr-19 08:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe NN stats for reelection should be ntx efficiency, not just raw ntx count

[26-Apr-19 08:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
e.g. (raw ntx)/(funds spent)

[26-Apr-19 09:00 AM] NNoperator#3835
If you take this argument to (ridiculous) extremes  KMD also matters,  if all the nodes had UTXO split count of 2 there are frequently KMD blocks that happen where all NN  supply of usable UTXOs would be depleted.  We would not be able to cover all the transactions.

[26-Apr-19 09:11 AM] NNoperator#3835
My point remains, as we continue to get more and more AC to notarize, and if a good fraction of NN choose to splitfunds in low single digits, we better stock up on KMD UTXOs because we are going to burn through them much faster.  It would be interesting thought experiment to figure out the amount (assuming all NN split the same) of UTXOs where KMD would deplete for all NN in a single block.

[26-Apr-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
split to 50 every 10minutes... covers over a 100 chains

[26-Apr-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
more chains increase to 100

[26-Apr-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
diffrenc from 50-10 0 isnt a lot, less than 50 is zero diffrence. Use thge lowest amount you can sustain tobe in every notarization.

[26-Apr-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you have too little number, you wont be able t oparticipate and will notarize less. Pretty simple

[26-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Alright#0419
KMD does not matter as KMD funding comes from mining

[26-Apr-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
it's really semantics here

[26-Apr-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
I just found it strange that jorian says the coins are not the OPs property

[26-Apr-19 09:31 AM] NNoperator#3835
If we had a big block and it contained 20 chain notarizations,  we would deplete all nodes if the only chose to splitfund at 4.

[26-Apr-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you split fund at 4, you cannot participarte as you have no reserve

[26-Apr-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you hurt your own counts ü§∑

[26-Apr-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
issnt a problem

[26-Apr-19 09:32 AM] NNoperator#3835
and dPow would break

[26-Apr-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the goal is to get AS MANY NOTARIZAITONS as POSSIBLE within the rules. The rules are to notarize.....

[26-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
if it hurts their counts, they can decide to do it or not

[26-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
they can decide regardless

[26-Apr-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cannot poplice a minimum ammount, but I tell you if you run too low your node will reserve a KMD utxo and then will no longer be able to aprticipate

[26-Apr-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hurting its counts... so nopbody will do this

[26-Apr-19 09:33 AM] NNoperator#3835
I am trying to show that it does matter if all nodes do this.  dPow will break down

[26-Apr-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its nonsensical to do so

[26-Apr-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cannot and will not break unless people dont know how to operate their nodes

[26-Apr-19 09:33 AM] NNoperator#3835
Yes it is nonsensical.

[26-Apr-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ifs not our fault that using less utxos gives a speed advantage. If thats not what its supposed to do change the software. its the only wya to change the rules.

[26-Apr-19 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
just make listunspent return a single 0.0001 utxo every time it's called

[26-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
and having more utxos does not harm you

[26-Apr-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ive had a few ideas on how to more efficnatly select utxo, but not getting time to explore it.  yes a custom listupsent just for iguana is needed

[26-Apr-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
returns the txid and vout to iguana only... locks in daemon saving and extr rpc call.

[26-Apr-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can also cache the utxos daemon side to skip wallet calls to make it almsot instant response. But it would take a while to develop. For very little outcome, apart from making notary even easier to manage than its already,

[26-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
do you guys think average time between notarizations is a good metric of up time?

[26-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
like if you don't notarize for days, it negatively impacts you?

[26-Apr-19 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
I really think notarization counts alone is a flawed metric because of latency

[26-Apr-19 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
regions are meant to alleviate this effect, but they aren't great at it

[26-Apr-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a penalty for down time is reasobable, can be a modifier to the `score` that is alrady used... but it can punsh people for real life emergencies etc also.

[26-Apr-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like DAA, well meaning changes, no matter how small can have some really bad effects

[26-Apr-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
current dPoW algo isnt perfect, but it is tuned and it works

[26-Apr-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
changing it in anyway risks making it worse

[26-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
yea I understand, not proposing changes right now, just throwing out ideas

[26-Apr-19 09:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Wouldn't latency also have a bearing on time between notarizations?

[26-Apr-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes cris

[26-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
*if*(big if) we were to make changes, they have to be well thought out

[26-Apr-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i think going to a dedicated DPOW chain would eliminate all the ping time and most server differences

[26-Apr-19 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
And tested.

[26-Apr-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only changes, I see possible is if a node doesn ntoarize anything for a day, remove som score... doesnt seem that many nodes do that as it is.

[26-Apr-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is a total overhaul of the entire dPoW network

[26-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
that makes that chain a single point of failure I believe

[26-Apr-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it also opens it up to hashrate attacks, etc

[26-Apr-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what I mean by similar to DAA

[26-Apr-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
where the simplest well meaning changes allows some horrible timewarp attack

[26-Apr-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
so what is the super horrible apocalyptic problem that requires to change dPoW?

[26-Apr-19 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
nothing really, I just think the latency thing encourages bad things like all nodes in same DC

[26-Apr-19 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and running dangerously low amounts of utxos... but anyone who does this in a production server with lots of chains will fail to notarize so I dont see it as an issue.

[26-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is self correcting

[26-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that is like changing PoW equipment because some miners use silly inefficient equipment

[26-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
ASIC resistance!

[26-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the purpose of dPoW primarily is to secure the networks. The game theory of NN is to maximize notarizations

[26-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
as the maximum notarization helps overall security, this is both simple  and aligned

[26-Apr-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont think there is any actual proof that better ping time helps notarizations in statistically meaningful ways

[26-Apr-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly a node with horrible connectivity wont do well, but that is not surprising

[26-Apr-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization protocol takes many seconds to complete. ping times less than a second likely wont affect results that much

[26-Apr-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if 80% of nodes are in EU, the other nodes cant notarize as much, this is fact. But this is a testnet/labs anomaly becuase there are no regions.

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[26-Apr-19 09:50 AM] CrisF#3405
And regions seems to be the most effective to max notarizations with some decentralization.

[26-Apr-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not my fault testnet didnt require regions

[26-Apr-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so why does lack of regions in testnet make it some sort of reason to change dPoW algo?

[26-Apr-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`ping + listunspent call time` 
This is what I found, if you ahve bad ping time, decrease listunspent time negates it a LOT. We are talking far less than 1s mening the diffrence between last and top in SH region from my testing. (that is if other nodes didnt optimize listunspent call time also)

[26-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so why not cache listunspent results?

[26-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
allocate utxo from a fixed list until it is used up, then refill cache

[26-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
this is an implementation issue, not algo

[26-Apr-19 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
I hacked up listunspent to return a single 0.0001 utxo each time

[26-Apr-19 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't help much from what I can see

[26-Apr-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes listunspent can be fixed easily really... You need a iguana `getutxo` calll for KMD ONLY ... that selects, from cache, locks.

[26-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
but I didn't really gather real data on it

[26-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
would need something to compare it against

[26-Apr-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
no offense, but such anecdotal result is not meaningful

[26-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
yes agreed

[26-Apr-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
filtering listuspent to return just 1 result does nothing, as it still needs to read the entire wallet.

[26-Apr-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
only a fully debugged, efficient utxo cache and release system is valid

[26-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
just sharing my thoughts, not supporting one view point or the other with them

[26-Apr-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to do a litunspent every say 15mins, save the result then remove each utxo from the list every time they are chosesn

[26-Apr-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, just make a fifo of utxo to return, refill with listunspent when it is empty
