The address he had back then was never reused, and only contains incoming TX (2)

i think they used to be at https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/agama/ but  it's an empty dir now

@Deleted User what os?

[25-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Mylo#8306
@Mylo  I found these ones when tried to reproduce some issue, but not very old

the privkey for hush is the same format as KMD or do i need generate a new privkey specially for hush?

[25-Sep-18 05:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if i have to generate it myself, how do i?

[25-Sep-18 05:13 PM] SHossain#0007
HUSH WIF = BTC WIF

anyone care to share his EMC2  build procedure steps?

[26-Sep-18 04:55 PM] jeezy#3408
the official doc leaves some room for optimization,

[26-Sep-18 04:55 PM] jeezy#3408
maybe someone got a best practice build down for NN

[26-Sep-18 04:55 PM] jeezy#3408

[26-Sep-18 05:00 PM] jeezy#3408
so you have boost lib system wide yea

[26-Sep-18 05:12 PM] cipi#4502
lol, i still wonder why everybody is messing around with libdb4.8, instead of passing `--with-incompatible-bdb` to the configure flags and use the libdb5.3, which is present in the linux distribution, but ok 😃

[26-Sep-18 05:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I tried @cipi and it would segfault when starting einsteiniumd. In my experience it works with some coins and not others

[26-Sep-18 05:30 PM] cipi#4502
strange, i did that with all coins on BarterDEX and never had problems

[26-Sep-18 05:31 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes it is strange, I've never been able to pinpoint why it works sometimes and not others. But I always try it first to save time.

[26-Sep-18 05:41 PM] jorian#4555
yes, didn't work for me as well

[27-Sep-18 12:03 PM] starfleet#5156
I have a question regarding EMC2 when improting the private keys with `/src/einsteinium-cli importprivkey NOTARY_WIF`

[27-Sep-18 12:09 PM] starfleet#5156
I get the error ```error code: -5
error message:
Invalid private key encoding```

[27-Sep-18 12:10 PM] starfleet#5156
Am I missing something here? Which format is NOTARY_WIF?

[27-Sep-18 12:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
I believe you need to import the BTC WIF

[27-Sep-18 12:10 PM] starfleet#5156
Yes I did that

[27-Sep-18 12:10 PM] starfleet#5156
gives same error

[27-Sep-18 12:11 PM] starfleet#5156
do I need any special format?

[27-Sep-18 12:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
ok than nevermind my comment no idea than.

[27-Sep-18 12:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
@webworker01  can you help

Ok thanks, will look tonight. Am traveling now. Thanks @webworker01 and @patchkez

[27-Sep-18 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
FYI, Hush is the same WIF as your BTC, for EMC2, use decker's script

[27-Sep-18 06:23 PM] Herbison (The Galt Mines)#4081
What branch of iguana are we supposed to be on and has EMC2 been funded yet? I am on DEV and iguana seems to be stopping or crashing.

[27-Sep-18 06:37 PM] infotech-al#5583
I have used DEV

[27-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Am on dev too

[27-Sep-18 09:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Herbison (The Galt Mines) yes, EMC2 has been funded. You must import your btc wif, and I currently use supernet dev branch

[27-Sep-18 09:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What about his concern of stopping or crashing? There is an issue there for sure. And its not lockunspent, staked notaries r running that without issues.

[27-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Herbison (The Galt Mines)#4081
I am trying the import uncompressed wif from Deckers updated script the compressed wif didn't appear to work.

[27-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Herbison (The Galt Mines)#4081
at least it never gave an address or balance.

[27-Sep-18 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
I always use compressed ones

[27-Sep-18 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
should return the address without any problem

[27-Sep-18 10:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I had iguana crash twice today as well on dev branch

{Reactions}
👌 

[27-Sep-18 11:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ahevent had any but my node has lost its "mojo" latley... If anyone could get a backtrace of a crash on dev that would help a lot. I am 99% sure its not lock unspent as STAKED notaries dont have a problem.

[28-Sep-18 03:37 AM] Herbison (The Galt Mines)#4081
I am compiling and resyncing EMC2 with Mylo's instructions in hopes that it works better. So far so good.

[28-Sep-18 03:59 AM] Herbison (The Galt Mines)#4081
FYI Deckers Site + Block explorer shows that many or most EMC2 addresses have not been funded.

[28-Sep-18 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Herbison (The Galt Mines) talk to @kolo about that, he is The Funder

[28-Sep-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh I have just been funding external coins with shapshit... buy 20 of them and never worry about it again.

[28-Sep-18 07:23 AM] Mylo#8306
ah...i'm on beta `d87f497fe1528e20b8a262abcaccf2f9daa8ee8b` think it was about 4 days ago i updated and beta/dev were in sync possibly...?

[28-Sep-18 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your on beta and your node is working ? lukechilds reported yesterday that on beta his node was totally stopped dead, changed to dev and its back near the top again 😕

[28-Sep-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm lost ... seems dev was merged into beta 4 days ago.

[28-Sep-18 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nothing makes any sense lol

[28-Sep-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
over the last 12H the amount of failed's has dropped by like 70% so it has to be people updateing that fixed it as there were no code changes.

[28-Sep-18 04:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
Those issues are different

[28-Sep-18 04:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
They are explaining how interest works with KMD and asking them to do the dirty work for us

[28-Sep-18 04:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm saying I'll hand everything to them on a silver platter, I just want confirmation if I put the work in they'll pull our changes into the official image

[28-Sep-18 04:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
which is a much more reasonable request

{Reactions}

[28-Sep-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
we aren't expecting them to add interest claiming functionality to their offical  wallets either

[28-Sep-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
we will still release our own tool which will be used with the ledger to claim the interest

[28-Sep-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
we literally just need them to approve the required KMD firmware updates and officially support them

[29-Sep-18 06:48 AM] eclips#1570
they are open to that, i have good contact with btchip who is working there

[29-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jorian#4555
That's good

[29-Sep-18 03:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
He didn't seem to open when I was chatting to him in their development slack

[29-Sep-18 03:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
He seemed to want us to build our own Ledger app

[29-Sep-18 03:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
However it wasn't clear if this would replace the official app or be a complementary app

[29-Sep-18 03:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
If it replaces their official app then not a huge deal I guess

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
I did ask for clarification but didn't hear back for a while

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
Oh just checked

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
He replied today

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
Kind of an ambiguous reply but I will get to the bottom of it

[29-Sep-18 03:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
Either way, looks like Ledger interested/reward claiming is happening

[29-Sep-18 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326

Please DM me when you see no funds, but first chechk out funding TX and verify your NN address was actually not funded. Chain is big, sync is slow, patience is good.
