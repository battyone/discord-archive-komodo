you eventually become a trusted node that everyone connects to

[31-Mar-19 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my ZEX pool has like 100 connections usually, is not restarted since sapling upgrade

my tmux has tmux :troll: 
running 9 servers from 1 terminal tab 😛

😂 🆒 

[31-Mar-19 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. How else do you think I force mined every KMD asset with CPU, pool, and debugging all on the same VM

[31-Mar-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tmux was a mad find... used it from day 1 when I built my node.

[31-Mar-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
googleed everything... knew nothing

[31-Mar-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I resisted learning how to use it forever, but after server 4 it became more of a necessity than an xtra

[31-Mar-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with a mouse the learning curve was small. Getting it to work wasnt easy though

[31-Mar-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that said I was CLI noob so everything was hard

[31-Mar-19 03:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
meh.. don't use a mouse.. gets in the way 😂

[31-Mar-19 03:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
i am curious about your learning path tho

[31-Mar-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mouse moves/sizes panes so much better

[31-Mar-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My laptop is i3... I got that shortly after node... didnt yuse mouse for ages... but got lazy again with my huge monitor

[31-Mar-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I taught myself and asked other ppl around here when i was stuck

well i'll be bugging you all come mid may 😄 .. quit my job to do this full time, refreshing my C/C++ and diving straight into the deep end

btw, for NN is it better to use bash or python for the scripts?

[31-Mar-19 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I bash everything, some prefer py
over all, I think it depends on what you need

[31-Mar-19 03:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm talking general stuff.. is py quicker than bash for managing an NN? i have all my stuff in py at work, but i see most scripts here in bash

[31-Mar-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the more intensive the action is, is the more py is better
with minor stuff, I think the difference is negligible

[31-Mar-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did all mine in bash as thats the examples I had to work from... but I want to re do the whole thing in py.. its just better

[31-Mar-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we have great libs for it now that make everything really easy

[31-Mar-19 03:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
in that case i'll port luke's and kmdlabs scripts in py

[31-Mar-19 03:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
i already have my own lib for rpc

[31-Mar-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I want to do KMDLABS in py ... with the ability to handle multiple reops ... so it can run external coins, or just forks of KMD.

[31-Mar-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`./start.py` for a notary node 🤣

[31-Mar-19 03:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
i might be able to help with that as soon as i have a better grasp of how this whole damn thing works 😂

{Reactions}
😂 

[31-Mar-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
problem is, there is much code in  komodod that enables then to work like that, external coins need code ported to them to use it.

[31-Mar-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you have no idea what your getting yourself into

[31-Mar-19 03:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
i have a rough idea.. that's why i'm doing it

[31-Mar-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not that bad, I managed to learn it pretty well in a year... but I also had quit my job and did it full time. And man, it was full time, more than I used to do at a job 😆

[31-Mar-19 03:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
i need the challenges.. i feel my brain melting at work... my iq dropping by the hour, not learning anything useful.. they don't even want to automate stuff, still doing checks manually because fek knows why

[31-Mar-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I had a lot to learn. 6 months of it I didn learn a lot at alll

[31-Mar-19 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I used it to make my pool and I hated it... took me days. That said I think it was easier to figure out what it was doing from scratch than iguana... that thing is confusing as hell ...

@mrlynch  there's some really useful Python RPC here -  https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/blob/master/stakerlib.py
e.g
```rpc_connection = def_credentials(chain)
pubkey = rpc_connection.getinfo()['pubkey']```

Is this related to this:  Then all notary nodes broadcast to each other their signature for a tx in notary id order for a fully populated 64 input transaction. Since we don't need more than 33 signatures, the top 33 notaries that responded and as ranked by the PoS scores from their slot, create a 33 input transaction for signature. In the event there is dropout of a signer from the first stage to the second, additional rounds are done, including replacements from responders in the first round.
