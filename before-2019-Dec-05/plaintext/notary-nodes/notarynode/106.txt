don't store/accept anything to your wallet if it does not come from yourself?

[08-Apr-19 12:11 PM] mrlynch#5735

I think this is needlessly complicated ... All it really needs is anm RPC to switch it on or off...

[08-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and block everything

[08-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the wallet code is checking all tx anyway sop I added an extra filter.

[08-Apr-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its not very well made, does work though.

Hello again,

[08-Apr-19 12:36 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
More problems 😦

[08-Apr-19 12:37 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
When I run ./m_notary_testnet

[08-Apr-19 12:37 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I get an ouput which include the following lines:

[08-Apr-19 12:37 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server PIZZA.(127.0.0.1:11608 validateaddress), retries: 4

[08-Apr-19 12:38 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Hae someone a clue of why is not connecting to pizza server?

[08-Apr-19 12:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is 11608 set in PIZZA.conf?

[08-Apr-19 12:42 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Yes, it is set

[08-Apr-19 12:42 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
rpcport=11608

[08-Apr-19 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure the username and passwork for RPC is set in conf

[08-Apr-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```rpcport=11608
rpcuser=MyUser
rpcpassword=MyPass

[08-Apr-19 12:43 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559

[08-Apr-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That error made my head explode a million times

[08-Apr-19 12:43 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
the user and pass...

[08-Apr-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
user+pass is normally the answer

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I notice you really went in high gear recently. Did you change your server?

[08-Apr-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1000tx on BEER just then in liek 3s 😄

[08-Apr-19 01:00 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Should I start PIZZA daemon with a specific command or it is enough by running the ./m_notary_testnet command?

[08-Apr-19 01:01 PM] Strob#3417
You need to start all the daemons fisrt

[08-Apr-19 01:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
./komodod -ac_name=PIZZA -ac_supply=100000000

[08-Apr-19 01:01 PM] CHMEX#0686

I put the addnodes in my .conf

[08-Apr-19 01:04 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
ok, one last question (i hope) the pubkey should be the btcpubkey?

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
No, it should be the pubkey of your KMD address. BTCpubkey is for mainnet

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
testnet is notarising AC's(BEER, PIZZA, TXSCLCC) to KMD

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Ok, the ine that it generates when I create the wallet

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
They're the only 4 chains you need to worry about

[08-Apr-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the pubkey is the same for all coins 😃

[08-Apr-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC or whatever... the address is generated by hashing it with a prefix

[08-Apr-19 01:07 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you do it through iguana 😉

[08-Apr-19 01:09 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Thanks to all, when my extremely busy (and cheap) server manage to start komodo again, I will try all this :S

[08-Apr-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Strob I did move, but the ping trade-off vs network speed made the move itself a nominal difference

see how I go, might get the wallet filter working on my node and send million of utxo at tit and see what happens

watching the blocks... the TX cache was like 3000->6000 then 3 blocks later back where it started

[08-Apr-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe a wallet filter isnt even needed with a good merge script and clean wallet transactions

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I noticed the other day that one of your wallet was like 200MB what were those watch-only data?

ok

[08-Apr-19 02:43 PM] newvulcan#4719
Ok, got the right software all in place, done a reboot and everything appears to have started with no errors except for the last bit (is not official notary). However although I though I had put my details into testnet, I hadn't, so I've just put a PR in - hopefully with that enabled everything should work 🤞
