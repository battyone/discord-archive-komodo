Notary Node Election 2019 & Testnet Guide

[03-Apr-19 04:36 PM] Greer#0666
yup, thats what I was attempting, but had grabbed jl777/SuperNET, was tripping up at ```SuperNET/agents/iguana
iguana main
iguana start.((null))
LITTLE ENDIAN arg.(nil)
SuperNET_MYINFO: generate session keypair
didnt find any elected notaries JSON in (elected)```
because clearly I needed the testnet repo and to edit testnet.json

[03-Apr-19 04:36 PM] Greer#0666
thanks for the additional resources, helpful

[03-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Strob#3417
but you can just use the supernet's iguana to create your pubkey : ```Temporary: start ~/SuperNET/agents/iguana just for setup, not for normal NN use, i.e., one time to get the pubkey```

[03-Apr-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Strob about the not on explorer bit, the short answer is: you'll see that happen when you didn't sign the tx that got signed

[03-Apr-19 04:39 PM] Strob#3417
ok

[03-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Greer#0666
@Strob thats how i read that but I get the error above, no keypair

[03-Apr-19 04:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what do u see when you sign?

[03-Apr-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
like `bestk.15 88e5 PIZZA height.71408 mod.0 VINI.5 myind.11 MINE........`

`>>>>>>>>>>> PIZZA dpow_sendrawtransaction` and `>>>>>>>>>>> KMD dpow_sendrawtransaction`
is the beginning of the process attempt

@Greer what are you trying to do?

[03-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Greer#0666
NN on testnet

[03-Apr-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you need to use
<https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet>
and follow
<https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet/blob/master/README.md>

[03-Apr-19 04:52 PM] Greer#0666
yup, I have that, but its missing a bunch, just jumps right into `Edit the iguana/testnet.json file. Add your pubkey and name` and `Start PIZZA, BEER, TXSCLCC and KMD daemons with -pubkey=` without being specific about which pubkey.  I think I got it now though,

[03-Apr-19 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not missing that, it's implied that you know what address you want to use and the pubkey of that address

[03-Apr-19 04:54 PM] Strob#3417
It's implied that you are a genius! 🤣

[03-Apr-19 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
people hate me for the things I say; if they only knew the things I think.....

[03-Apr-19 04:58 PM] Greer#0666
"address you want to use ...." node Bitcoin address, node KMD address, funded Bitcoin address, vote KMD address?

[03-Apr-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we're not using BTC for testnet

[03-Apr-19 04:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
because they find you overly sarcastic sometimes ? I'm fine with that though 😬

[03-Apr-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as for other, all Komodo addresses carry across all assetchains with the same privkey and address

[03-Apr-19 04:59 PM] Greer#0666
I'm not asking those questions, justifying my statement that information is lacking.

[03-Apr-19 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm guessing because someone assumed that the ecosystem addressing went without saying for anyone applying for the job

[03-Apr-19 05:02 PM] ca333#0118
yes i dont manage the keys - i would probably have to be anon otherwise. And needless to say that our ICO funds escrow parties are some of the most trusted in the cryptoverse.

_thinks he could take @ca333 with $10M on the line :troll:_

[03-Apr-19 05:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
`The important step is this command where you get your pubkey (called btcpubkey and not pubkey!!!) and the KMDwif called BTCDwif. A bit confusing but that's the way it is. `
@Strob Just clarify for the testnet only, are we still required to use the btcpubkey? My impression was that you could use a KMD address pubkey and this would work. I can get this from any wallet address, Why do I need to do it through iguana for the testnet?

[03-Apr-19 05:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@Greer I think it's better to follow this guide first, it's very detaild, but you can  skip all the btc parts https://docs.komodoplatform.com/notary/setup-Komodo-Notary-Node.html , then continue with https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet/blob/master/README.md

@NutellaLicka where'd you get that bit?

[03-Apr-19 05:06 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was quoting @Strob

@PHBA2061 thanks, thats where I ended up, you confirming thats what I should follow in that order is a big help.

Yeah I know, that's why I was confused with what he said.

[03-Apr-19 05:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@NutellaLicka on testnet you can use any secure address and it's pubkey. after the election, elected nodes needs to generate the address and pubkey inside the node itself. (you never should use seed phrase or wif of your mainnet node in another computer)

[03-Apr-19 05:16 PM] Greer#0666
I think he was referring to this:
"In the output of the executed file you will see a lot of data. **Get the btcpubkey (not the pubkey!**) (`03a47c429b6fd83dc9687ba409ee6f34823094b97bad4c0f4f60649c55bbdf497b`) and send it to Kolo. It is strongly recommended to write the above info somewhere and save it."

[03-Apr-19 05:17 PM] SHossain#0007
that is for the elected notaries

[03-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Strob#3417
It's when you use the command in the steps to create an "iguana wallet" the output will contain first a "pubkey" and a btcpubkey, you need the btcpubkey and not pubkey.

[03-Apr-19 06:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
needs to be 7 of us to update

[03-Apr-19 06:46 PM] SHossain#0007
actually doesn't need 7 of us to update. but until 7 of us update, no notarization (kind of)

[03-Apr-19 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
