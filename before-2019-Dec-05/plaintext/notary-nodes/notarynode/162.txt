Can I ask, when using KMD tipbot, if I list a number of users, does it split the balance I specify equally between the users, or do I have to specify how much each user gets ?

[21-Apr-19 12:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Try `!kmdtip help` in #tip-bot.  I believe you need to send different transactions for different amounts.  `rain` `soak` `shitstorm` etc divide evenly.

@NNoperator thanks for the data. i didn't specify or pledge any % of mining rewards but i've been contributing to the ecosystem as i saw myself fit and will keep doing it. most of the time those happens under the radar and maybe only few people are aware of those. generally i don't self promote much, just wanted to let the voters and whales to know. :abusedsmily:

If it sees Y or y there is  conditional formatting to turn green.  It is really cool to simultaneously edit a document.  I'll never get over that thrill, after working with documents (at Apple with 200 other people) that I had to lock prior to editing (and 10% of the editors would forget to lock and ruin your edits)

Is it a false impression or notarization seems to be slowing down for everyone and I feel like mine is slowing down even more ?

@Alright  You attacked SHossain??? I missed that one (even though I think I read everything here)! What happened? He is such a nice person!

[21-Apr-19 06:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I missed what supposedly happened, but imo `a guy 100% on it` can withstand an attack 🤷🏽

[21-Apr-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
Do believe dwy meant I attacked his character, maybe I'm misunderstanding that though

[21-Apr-19 06:56 PM] Alright#0419
He believes the region rule does not apply to him because his name is green. I'll leave it at that. We've been over this a million and one times

[21-Apr-19 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`meant I attacked his character`
I missed that bit too 🤷🏽

[21-Apr-19 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[21-Apr-19 06:57 PM] SHossain#0007
> He believes the region rule does not apply to him because his name is green. I'll leave it at that. We've been over this a million and one times
@Alright now you are talking non-sense

[21-Apr-19 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain he's referring to the belief that
`only thing i've been doing is keep them running reliably, upgrade when needed and test what comes up.`
shouldn't qualify as a "dev" node physically running in EU for someone elected not in EU
and yes, we have been over this a million and one times

[21-Apr-19 07:02 PM] SHossain#0007
```
kolo07/04/2019
it was swapped with @Decker to easify for both
```

[21-Apr-19 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_missed the bit where that makes elected regions of any value_

[21-Apr-19 07:06 PM] SHossain#0007
Decker was elected for EU and I won a node in AR. we swapped nodes while there was balance in region/nodes. both of our nodes performed reliably and has top performance.  This wasn't because my name is in green.

[21-Apr-19 07:06 PM] Alright#0419
You were elected in AR. You ran the node in EU and competed in AR. If it were "swapped", it should have competed with other EU nodes. Also if it were "swapped" that would mean you had 2 EU nodes.

[21-Apr-19 07:06 PM] Alright#0419
If it were truly swapped, you'd have two EU nodes being reelected in EU.

[21-Apr-19 07:07 PM] SHossain#0007
what would happen if i were to buy out a node in the EU?

[21-Apr-19 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As a random example:
If I vote for ca333 in SH and he gets it and moves to AR that he lost in, wtf was I bothering to vote SH for? 🤷🏽

[21-Apr-19 07:09 PM] SHossain#0007
> If I vote for ca333 in SH and he gets it and moves to AR that he lost in, wtf was I bothering to vote SH for?
this is not exactly what happened.

[21-Apr-19 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain did you win an elected position in EU? or in AR?

[21-Apr-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
why arent people attacking decker also?

[21-Apr-19 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`this is not exactly what happened.`
No, but I'm trying to get you and several others to see that this is a complaint/issue about the process and it's not a personal attack on/about you

[21-Apr-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
they each won in their region, but logistics issues and a swap was worked out and approved by kolo

[21-Apr-19 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and approved by kolo`
Is the central issue, imo

[21-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the world is not a perfect place, but since this seems to have made so many people upset that one person that won in EU swapped with another that won in AR, this wont be allowed anymore

[21-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c that s honestly what I told to @Alright , I just think because decker is a star and code, and @SHossain doesnt. I didn t speak about it to wake up conflicts, I just want unity, and to me Shossain is valuable, and we need him

[21-Apr-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but what exactly is the unfair gain here?

[21-Apr-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Apr-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Deleted User#0000

whatever attacks on shossain, please attack decker equally

[21-Apr-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
also keep attacking kolo for every single decision he made that you disagree with

[21-Apr-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and realize how unfair this is, if you put yourself in the others shoes

[21-Apr-19 07:30 PM] Deleted User#0000

and I love both sides.

[21-Apr-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand why it is still an issue. both sides gained/lost nothing when combined, but this wont be allowed for anybody anymore anyway

[21-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
If someone can fill me in on decker's node's situation, I will do the same. I don't believe it's the same situation though.

[21-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
He competed in the correct region as far as I understand

[21-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
He competed in the region he ran his node in

So that it's clear to all:
Everything I said on the above topic was never anything personal against @SHossain (whom I do actually like), but issues with the system and perception.
As for anyone else whom I may or may not have "attacked", what I've said likely stands on its own case-by-case basis of merit 😛
