@webworker01 PM me address, I will send back those 20KMD, maybe it will be life saver for your actual voters

Anyone with Charinstrike that can give an update on Vote2018 share payment? It was supposed to be every 4 months but I haven't see anything

[09-Sep-18 09:52 PM] vrcninja#5651
@dukeleto  I think you are running the Chainstrike SH Node correct? Can you provide an update on share payment for the Vote2018 elections?

[10-Sep-18 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@vrcninja I run it with @jeezy , and all airdrop funds are send to a dedicated address each week: https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RVwS8ghZtR89QxLXPGPJtqZEQ6KmfP7WEZ . You are right that we haven't dispersed funds to that or our 10% projects fund that is stored in: https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RF79i22W3YXMGsjzBLXNxU5KvWe31dG5pQ

[10-Sep-18 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
thanks for the reminder

https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json is very useful and I know there is another equivalent. we now have exchanges requiring that coins secure against 51% attack and 120 confirmations is too brute force, so we can use a txid lookup for notarized chain where it would simply return one of 3 values:
not notarized
notarized to KMD
the KMD notarization tx notarized to BTC

then with an api endpoint, they can use it to query for specific coin deposits. In case of error, then default to a large number of blocks.

I can offer a 777 KMD bounty for this functionality.

Notarystats.com can have this sort of api too. Atm it reports lag txids and history.
Code is available for exchanges to fork it. Should I add some functionalities or is webworker already on it ?

[11-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basically check if the block of the tx happened before or after the latest ntrz ?

[11-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then return one of the 3 choices ?

[11-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c

[11-Sep-18 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
exchanges need a simple single call api that answers the question of whether a specific deposit txid is BTC (or KMD) notarized

[11-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok

[11-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will work on it on thursday. That shouldn t be a problem

[11-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do we need some sort of double layers : check a txid of an assetchain / external coin and return kmd ntrz status and up layer kmd-> btc statud

[11-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like first param : coin and second : txif

[11-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Txid

[11-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Kmd would return btc and kmd ntrz and assetchains would return the same plus coin -> kmd

[11-Sep-18 06:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
Doesn't having a single API centralise everything to the API and open up a massive attack vector

[11-Sep-18 06:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
if someone pwns the API server they can just say TXs are notarised when they aren't and trick exchanges

[11-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nope as source code is forkable and exchanges can just run their version

[11-Sep-18 06:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
oh I see, they run their own version against their own full nodes

[11-Sep-18 06:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, that's a great solution

[11-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
:)

[11-Sep-18 06:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think that will take me a little more time as i ll have to rely on a notarizations db. But nothing impossible

[11-Sep-18 06:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
the best case is an exchange runs the API for themselves, against their own full nodes, and can also ask external sources like a "kmd official" and other trusted exchanges for additional protection

[11-Sep-18 06:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
if everything does not match, a human should probably inspect the situation

[11-Sep-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
That s the goal

[11-Sep-18 06:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am working with the coins that brought up the need for this API

[11-Sep-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
In my case it works and code is already shared but as am not a pure dev code is not optimized

[11-Sep-18 06:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
Bittrex and Cryptopia will need to hit a simple API, which they can host themselves, of whether a txid for COIN has hit the BTC chain

[11-Sep-18 06:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
they already run all the full nodes already

[11-Sep-18 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[11-Sep-18 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
All instructions are given

[11-Sep-18 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are pausing trading on various coins, and making them pay for double spend attacks, and not allowing trading again until they prove they are secure against attacks

[11-Sep-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
1 part on a ramdom full node. 1 part on a webserv.

[11-Sep-18 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think it's a time where Komodo can really help a lot of coins, if we make it as simple as possible, no simpler 😃

[11-Sep-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
our current API is unfriendly, but it's very close to what is needed

[11-Sep-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
I can help, just let me know

[11-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Btw I believe @@webworker01 already has all the info / db etc... so I don t want to "steal" the bounty if there is one. I ll talk with him about it before. As I won t be available before thursday that will let me the time to design the db and underlying logic.

[11-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Actual state of working scripts only allows for latest info on the fly. So i ll have to figure out how to rewind from beginning to be able to query any tx

[11-Sep-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am working on dpow for the coins, so dwy and webworker can share the 777 kmd bounty or decide amongst themselves

[11-Sep-18 06:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basically just parse blocks and global db build. But it can be done very fast

[11-Sep-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am focusing on the c++ integration of dpow header files to the coins, and there is only so much time in the day

[11-Sep-18 06:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Need 48h a day

[11-Sep-18 06:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Lol

[11-Sep-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
running our own api for our own use is one thing

[11-Sep-18 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might make sense to have a self-contained service that we can give to exchanges to run

[11-Sep-18 06:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
For exchanges is another level. Yeah that s why I say that my webinterface is not optimized yet

[11-Sep-18 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not a docker fanboy, but if we could say "docker run komodo-notary-truthsayer", that is nice from their perspective

[11-Sep-18 06:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
something that assumes it can talk to full nodes of all relevant coins

[11-Sep-18 06:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
and answers the "is this txid ntz'ed to btc/kmd?" question in a simple JSON api

[11-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
But at least figuring out how to auto build db for any coin then implement the api and yeah you re right : share and make it "bootstrappable"

[11-Sep-18 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll wait for @webworker01 . As I said I just want to participate and don t want to interfere in his work / current bounties / claims

[11-Sep-18 08:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think a docker container would be a big win for an ease of integration perspective

[11-Sep-18 08:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
also

[11-Sep-18 08:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
maybe this could be something NNs could do

[11-Sep-18 08:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
each NN could run a copy of the API

[11-Sep-18 08:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
so people wouldn't even need to run their own instance (even though they should too)

[11-Sep-18 08:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
they could just query the NNs

[11-Sep-18 08:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
they should query all NNs and compare the results

[11-Sep-18 08:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
and if any differ, something is wrong

That was the primary goal while developping lazynode : having some sort of network of node that share their status. Stats. Commit number. And notarizations queries.

[11-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
More global reactivity as we can identify a failure totally transparently and securely as nn is never queried.

many coins are coming to KMD, being forced to implement something by exchanges, and they don't really understand how notary nodes work or what they do. So I am hoping this document bridges that gap

[12-Sep-18 03:08 PM] Mylo#8306

Any idea why chips is lagging ?   It has been over 4 days since last notarization.

[13-Sep-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah what happened with VerusHash port?

[13-Sep-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems dev on it stopped when i moved on to other stuff?

[13-Sep-18 04:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
is anybody actively working on the API to answer "is txid of COIN notarized to btc/kmd?", it's pretty important for various coins wanting KMD dpow

[13-Sep-18 04:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
exchanges are pausing their trading and forcing them to prove they are secure against double spends, and that means the exchange needs a trusted way to decide if it's safe to make transactions

[13-Sep-18 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD needs to run it's own public version, perhaps every NN could run their own. And each exchange can run their own internally and compare to KMD official ones

[13-Sep-18 04:42 PM] SHossain#0007
@webworker01 is that something you can add in the stats site? ^^

[13-Sep-18 04:47 PM] SHossain#0007

@dukeleto update on this : I talked about it with @webworker01 . We figured out that he probably need 10* less times to get it working than me building it from scratch from db to scripts. So I told him I ll let him handle it. Most of the work would then be to have a minimal version ready for public.

[13-Sep-18 04:51 PM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User if you and @webworker01 working together on this, you guys can share the bounty

Maybe a final step would be to be able to package it and make it ready to run directly

[13-Sep-18 04:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
(But that s the next step. First is to get it done and that will surely require a full rescan)

[13-Sep-18 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
a good first step is for KMD to provide a public API, but for exchanges to trust this API for very large transactions, imho, they need to run it themselves. Maybe they would be fine just hitting our API at first while they get their own internal one running

[13-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. 1st step is to match the needs

[13-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
2nd is to make it portable

[13-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
3rd is to make it as a standalone package

[13-Sep-18 05:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Global purpose. To me. Is to get it automated just using assetchains.json gor example. So in case of assetchains adding in the future it s already handled

[13-Sep-18 06:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
if we could make it trivial for each NN to run this API, that makes the system a lot more decentralized

[13-Sep-18 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
some exchanges might not be OK with hitting an external API to decide on whether it's safe to do a double spend. If you are super paranoid sysadmin person, it's not unreasonable to feel that way

[13-Sep-18 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody could do a BGP attack and make the API say whatever they want, to allow a big double spend to proceed
