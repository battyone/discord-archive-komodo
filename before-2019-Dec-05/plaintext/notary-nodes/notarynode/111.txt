Whats the benefit of being a Notary node?

[10-Apr-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The knowledge of knowing you actively helped secure the network (and pay of course)

[10-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
oh okay

[10-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986

2190 divided out among voters isn't much to the voters

[10-Apr-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if they get 1 million votes and get elected, each vote gets 0.00219 KMD

[10-Apr-19 02:14 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
per month?

How much pungo do you think voters will recieve each month?

[10-Apr-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has no clue how many pungo there are or their creation timetable_

[10-Apr-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@Mr.Cryptodude  there's a schedule of payments to voters by one of the current Notary nodes here - https://komodoelection.com/proposals/madmax/

_wouldn't vote for them just because they call it a "token"_

[10-Apr-19 02:31 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Surely people want valuable contributions to the komodo community, rather than a bit of dust?

[10-Apr-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they don't do the math, so the dust *sounds like* not dust in the promises (unless you're just that big of a whale)

[10-Apr-19 02:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
`0.19367634/month` is not worth the potential price increase of the coin that somebody that develops/creates/markets, would do.

[10-Apr-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, the mentality is:
the vote coins are free
the promised %age is free
I get free KMD for voting

[10-Apr-19 02:38 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is a pretty simple minded way of looking at it I suppose

[10-Apr-19 02:40 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If anyone is here wondering who to vote for. Id reccommend having a think about the affects on the community and development that would come from voting somebody in. These affects could have a greater impact on the coin price in the long run (if all you care about is coin price).

`That is a pretty simple minded way of looking at it I suppose`
sadly that's the space we live in, the percentage of people in the space that actually care about crypto and security as opposed to bandwagoning on the new "get rich quick" is well below 40% in my best guess

[10-Apr-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
although, at this exact moment, I can't cast too much shade given that I'm mining a chain I know will be dead next week just because I might make a few bucks next year 😛

[10-Apr-19 02:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
... way way below 40% ☹

My bribe to the KMD community is I will help secure coins with dpow and use a portion of the funds to help drive development throughout the community.

[10-Apr-19 03:03 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically difference between `whats in it for me` and `whats in it for the ecosystem/community`.  This extends far beyond crypto. Long term, a 1% rise in KMD value thanks to projects, initiatives  and capabilities  benefits far more and longer into future  than 1% now for 1 year of VOTE token paybacks.

[10-Apr-19 03:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I understand the strategy of offering your own chains coins to extend adoption from a devs perspective, but `does not compute` for me from a voter perspective.

my bribes are indirect, only redeemable through participation beyond vote casting, and open to even the flatitious few who vote for all the other worthy candidates.

funny to see that when james says he won't vote for NNs that reward voters, suddenly many are against it, while last year it wasn't a problem and probably a lot were elected for those rewards.
