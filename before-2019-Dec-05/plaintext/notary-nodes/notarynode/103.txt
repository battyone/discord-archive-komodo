Decker owns one of 4 dev nodes this year

[07-Apr-19 10:18 PM] kolo#1111
Plus any nodes he wins by voters

[07-Apr-19 10:18 PM] kolo#1111
Hopefully 3 more 😃

[07-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
is alien_AR up for autoreelection in AR or EU?

[07-Apr-19 10:18 PM] kolo#1111
yes, AR

[07-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Alright#0419
The node in EU is being autoreelected to AR? 😐

[07-Apr-19 10:20 PM] kolo#1111
Yes, and by your good watch will be moved to AR

[07-Apr-19 10:21 PM] kolo#1111
Notarization counts are not affected in EU or AR, only in SH

[07-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Alright#0419
Can I run my AR node(if elected) in US until 2020? It's more convenient for me 😛

[07-Apr-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If @kolo says "yes" then you can

[07-Apr-19 10:24 PM] kolo#1111
Are you developing KMD code?

[07-Apr-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain isn't

[07-Apr-19 10:25 PM] kolo#1111
And if someone wants to run in AR winning in US and wishing to swap with you

[07-Apr-19 10:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
who, in their right mind, would give up good ping times for worse ones?

[07-Apr-19 10:26 PM] Alright#0419
I would still compete in AR region?

[07-Apr-19 10:26 PM] kolo#1111
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 actual pings here in between are better than in US

[07-Apr-19 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kolo that entirely depends on the host and location

[07-Apr-19 10:27 PM] Alright#0419
me asking whether I can host it in US if elected in AR is for the sake of making my point

[07-Apr-19 10:27 PM] kolo#1111
EU is closer

[07-Apr-19 10:28 PM] kolo#1111
Answer wont change since days ago you already asked me. If there is strict development need.

[07-Apr-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
He was elected in AR. He runs it in France because it's more convenient. It's not 1/4 dev nodes. He's being auto-reelected to a region he didn't run the node in for the majority of the year.

[07-Apr-19 10:28 PM] SHossain#0007
`it was swapped with @Decker to easify for both`

[07-Apr-19 10:29 PM] Alright#0419
You have two nodes in EU

[07-Apr-19 10:29 PM] SHossain#0007
`it was swapped with @Decker to easify for both`

[07-Apr-19 10:29 PM] kolo#1111
@Decker invented all possible ways to speed up notarizations, clear wallets and coded them. He also stabily wins in AR region.

[07-Apr-19 10:30 PM] kolo#1111
@Alright can say decker won re-election and gave node to @SHossain . That also fits your witness system?

[07-Apr-19 10:31 PM] kolo#1111
:troll:

[07-Apr-19 10:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we can say a banana is a grapefruit, but that doesn't make it so

[07-Apr-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
I don't know what you mean by witness system, but I very much dislike that these rules are not objective

[07-Apr-19 10:32 PM] Alright#0419
I guess we didn't have a rule for swapping nodes

[07-Apr-19 10:32 PM] Alright#0419
but we absolutely should

[07-Apr-19 10:32 PM] Alright#0419
I think we do have a rule of 1 node per person per region though, no?

[07-Apr-19 10:33 PM] kolo#1111
I spent too much time explaining exceptions for development, when it doesn’t fit in years rules

[07-Apr-19 10:33 PM] kolo#1111
For development only

[07-Apr-19 10:33 PM] Alright#0419
the reason we have dev nodes

[07-Apr-19 10:34 PM] kolo#1111
All 64 nodes are dev nodes here. If you win get ready to do same daily

[07-Apr-19 10:35 PM] kolo#1111
Somewhere ~3 years ago I came here also to just one time setup one server for KMD 😉

[07-Apr-19 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
clear cut objective rules

[07-Apr-19 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
no grey areas

[07-Apr-19 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
This is what I want. This is what we need.

[07-Apr-19 10:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I spent too much time explaining exceptions for development`
When you get to be the sole decider of that which is supposed to be decentralized, is "too much time explaining" even possible?

[07-Apr-19 10:39 PM] kolo#1111
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 he already asks that question many many days. I can now only allow to dislike me for allowing guys to swap nodes.

[07-Apr-19 10:39 PM] Alright#0419
I don't dislike you. I dislike the lack of transparency and objective ruleset

[07-Apr-19 10:39 PM] newvulcan#4719
Just checking - Have had gamecreditsd running for a while, but haven't had any blocks downloaded - is that correct ? Have 8 connections in getinfo

[07-Apr-19 10:40 PM] kolo#1111
How should I solve situation when important core developer appears in between elections?

[07-Apr-19 10:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kolo I don't "dislike you"; I haven't even had enough interactions with you to form an opinion in that manner
I'm asking, as I always do, what I feel to be honest and valid questions. Especially in light of the fact that Komodo is *routinely* accused of being centralized

[07-Apr-19 10:42 PM] kolo#1111
That’s why this year I declined any lists of candidates published, allowing anybody to just get needed amount of VOTEs to win

[07-Apr-19 10:42 PM] kolo#1111
Will try better next year and hope nothing special happens to require some gray moves

[07-Apr-19 10:43 PM] Alright#0419
I might not be an "important core developer", but I assure you I will find bugs if I have a notary pubkey. I've been waiting a year for this.

[07-Apr-19 10:43 PM] kolo#1111
Awesome

[07-Apr-19 10:43 PM] Alright#0419
and I'm not sure how that relates to the current situation

[07-Apr-19 10:44 PM] kolo#1111
But if you will need e.g. work with hardware, requiring you to have server accessible by foot - you won’t be allowed. And no one else

[07-Apr-19 10:45 PM] kolo#1111
Even if no harm for competition or network is done

[07-Apr-19 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
Do believe that's what the 4 dev nodes are for

[07-Apr-19 10:46 PM] kolo#1111
Yes and that’s why this year Decker owns one wherever it’s convenient

[07-Apr-19 10:47 PM] Alright#0419
I know you don't want new rules for this upcoming year, but I'd like to propose a simple one. No swapping. Run your node in your region or be disqualified.

[07-Apr-19 10:47 PM] kolo#1111
It was correct last year also. Since the start

[07-Apr-19 10:48 PM] kolo#1111
With couple of exceptions did for better result of all network

[07-Apr-19 10:48 PM] Alright#0419
subjectiveness

[07-Apr-19 10:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"No swapping" "With couple of exceptions " isn't "No swapping"

[07-Apr-19 10:49 PM] kolo#1111
I assume swapping once is a minor mistake

[07-Apr-19 10:50 PM] kolo#1111
You did not answered back than how to qualify cloud nodes, round robin nodes and anycast nodes

[07-Apr-19 10:50 PM] kolo#1111
Will appreciate most fair solution

[07-Apr-19 10:51 PM] Alright#0419
2020, get rid of regions?

[07-Apr-19 10:51 PM] kolo#1111
Needed for geopolitical reasons

[07-Apr-19 10:51 PM] Alright#0419
tor possibly?

[07-Apr-19 10:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo getting rid of regions would be worse; for "decentralized reasons" and not "geopolitical reasons"

[07-Apr-19 10:51 PM] kolo#1111
It’s still crypto which can be banned fast in whole regions

[07-Apr-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
tor possibly? 😂

[07-Apr-19 10:52 PM] kolo#1111
Untrustable

[07-Apr-19 10:53 PM] kolo#1111
My (subjective ) opinion is that while at least one tail of cloud waive in announced region - it’s ok

[07-Apr-19 10:53 PM] kolo#1111
Fits into main reason of having regions

[07-Apr-19 10:53 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean by untrustable?

[07-Apr-19 10:54 PM] Alright#0419
if we keep NN comms within tor, how does that not make regions irrelevant?

[07-Apr-19 10:55 PM] phm87#7395
about the dwy attack that may occur on BEER from tomorrow 3 PM UTC, do you think that this mitigation scipt is suitable or a better one exists ?

`do you think that this mitigation scipt is suitable or a better one exists ?`
both 😛

[07-Apr-19 10:56 PM] Alright#0419
Not sure tbh 😂

[07-Apr-19 10:57 PM] kolo#1111
Because not limiting regions will result all nodes in OVH

[07-Apr-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
That will work for all UTXOs that are not 0.0001 p2pk I think

[07-Apr-19 10:57 PM] kolo#1111
And we won’t be able to see that until OVH band crypto nodes and network dead

[07-Apr-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
but who knows, maybe they will be 0.0001 p2pk UTXOs

{Reactions}
😟 

[07-Apr-19 10:58 PM] phm87#7395
OVH can't go against EU rules

[07-Apr-19 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
I believe regions introduce a high degree of subjectivity and that anything we can do to not have them is worth it. You can't know for sure every node will be in OVH

[07-Apr-19 11:00 PM] phm87#7395
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  Do you have a better mitigation script to suggest against dwy attack ?

[07-Apr-19 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
delete the wallet, import without rescan and re-fund your node

[07-Apr-19 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
and deal with it later 😂

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-Apr-19 11:02 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you

[07-Apr-19 11:02 PM] Alright#0419
I'm having trouble getting our dwy bomb script working with sapling, may be sometime later this week

[07-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
@phm87 that was a joke, you would have to eventually deal with it on mainnet

[07-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
and if it were a persistent attack, you would need to do it very often

[07-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
and obviously you wouldn't be able to re-fund all coins on mainnet

[07-Apr-19 11:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 I don't have one to suggest, I can't share *all* of my secrets

[07-Apr-19 11:04 PM] Alright#0419
The one from StakedNotary is the best we have atm I believe

[07-Apr-19 11:04 PM] Alright#0419
cleanwallettransaction helps a hell of a lot as well

[07-Apr-19 11:04 PM] Alright#0419
you'll need a combination of the two

[07-Apr-19 11:04 PM] phm87#7395
I'd prefer to use 2 or 3 nodes (docker maybe) and do your trick and change of node when it needs it but unsure of frequency

[07-Apr-19 11:05 PM] Alright#0419
frequency?

[07-Apr-19 11:06 PM] phm87#7395
should I run ./dwy_attack_mitigation.sh once per second or once per 60 seconds ?

[07-Apr-19 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
believe I had it cron for every 6 hours on my LABS node when we were testing this

[07-Apr-19 11:07 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you
