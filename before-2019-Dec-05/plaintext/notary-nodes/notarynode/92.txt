not sure why that was decided against

[06-Apr-19 08:15 AM] Ludom#5832
Last year, some people proposed to much node and they lose for this reason

[06-Apr-19 08:15 AM] Alright#0419
run for 2 nodes, post a single z address, distribute to one or both depending on need

[06-Apr-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
*still thinks we should be allwoed 2 nodes in the same region so there doesnt need to be special exemptions*

[06-Apr-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then I would run for 2 no problem

[06-Apr-19 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
*refuses to rent servers*

i‚Äôm surprised AR has the most

[06-Apr-19 08:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I noticed a proposal which included a z-address

[06-Apr-19 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
AR is the best region... but also the most competetive

[06-Apr-19 08:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and another proposal for all regions from an existing NN team which is in top half of all regions already ü§∑

There are still proposals which include voter share, despit jl saying he wouldnt vote for ppl who do that this time.

[06-Apr-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
can we make a list of candidates not offering bribes

[06-Apr-19 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To be clear, donating to ecosyem projects is not vote share?

[06-Apr-19 08:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm offering community comps open to all including those who dont vote for me, does that count?

[06-Apr-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
that is fine

[06-Apr-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
having funds that help the community, directly is best, indirectly is good too

[06-Apr-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and just sending it back to voters does more harm than good

[06-Apr-19 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine is pretty simple 'if I have KMD left over i will dontate it to LABS or other ecosystem projects if they need it up to 50% of node revenue"

[06-Apr-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
even making a bounty fund that you control is better

[06-Apr-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
having a community run bounty fund would allow notaries that are not creative enough to come up with worthwhile things to donate to that

[06-Apr-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS will have the bounty fund... maybe it can also have a mecanisim to pay shared KMD revenues ü§î

[06-Apr-19 08:25 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`even making a bounty fund that you control is better`
ü§î I kinda like that better than my idea of donating to 2 dev funds

[06-Apr-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or the bonty CC can be deployed on KMDCC chain

[06-Apr-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, if it turns out your self-managed bounty fund goes only to yourself, i think people will see that, so maybe constrain the bounties for some specific area, be it something useless like exchange listings, SuperBowl ads, CMC banners, GUI, websites, etc

[06-Apr-19 08:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I saw a payout schedule which returned a large percentage last year, but the economy wasn't really significant. Something like 6 kmd per 1000 votes... seems more mrketing than product tbh. Just like national elections üòÇ

[06-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
is there any limitation on coinbase vouts in easy mined blocks?

[06-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
can I split it in the coinbase itself is what I'm wondering

[06-Apr-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
bribe promises just creates extra work for small pennies and creates a bad impression

[06-Apr-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
splitting coinbase would make you forfeit txfees

[06-Apr-19 08:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
its a false economy for anyone doing the math

[06-Apr-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
even the big giant ones that occasionally happen

[06-Apr-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
correct

[06-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
Believe that only affects ac_private chains?

[06-Apr-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
much better to have it concentrated in the hands of a single purpose fund

[06-Apr-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe burn txfees is only non-KMD chains, so probably you can

[06-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Ludom#5832
Ind√©Nodes runs a Community found since day 1

[06-Apr-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We set on up, but on our sliding scale of KMD price, it never got activated in teh ber market.

[06-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Ludom#5832
It finances mostly the Komodo Meetup but not only

[06-Apr-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main priority is the nodes uptime and costs are covered...

[06-Apr-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
exactly

[06-Apr-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
kickbacks to people that are making far more from 5%, is not getting any extra value

[06-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Ludom#5832
Promotion of Komodo in french speaking communities

[06-Apr-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
language specific expansion is a good use for selfmanaged bounties

[06-Apr-19 08:30 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
On KMD chain, you can have multiple outs and get fees, so assumptively it could be done in-daemon as well @Alright

[06-Apr-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
as that is not so expensive and leverages all existing materials once it is translated

[06-Apr-19 08:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what are the rules regarding nepotism? Is it okay if separated to third generation?  :6849_pepeold:

[06-Apr-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
disclose it and you can have your dog manage your bounty fund

[06-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Ludom#5832
We don't need really translation in French

[06-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ cannot be done on assetchains? That txfee burn affects all assetchains?

The people can read english

[06-Apr-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
then promotion to languages that have populations that read english

[06-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Ludom#5832
Supporting community is more about creation of original content

[06-Apr-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe paying for someone to be active on social media in that language

[06-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Ludom#5832
in French

[06-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Ludom#5832
Exactly

[06-Apr-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
original content is good too, but much harder than just being active in SM

[06-Apr-19 08:32 AM] Ludom#5832
Social media is a thing

[06-Apr-19 08:32 AM] Ludom#5832
But we reach influencers

[06-Apr-19 08:32 AM] Ludom#5832
It's better

[06-Apr-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Apr-19 08:33 AM] Ludom#5832
Some influencers are not on social media

[06-Apr-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
social media, new content, events, new dev work, the list is varied as to what is possible and each NN should think carefully about what they would actually be good at managing

[06-Apr-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
if we are in a bull market, then a $5 price is not unreasonable, so there could be $7500+ per month, which would allow for at least decent amounts of new initiatives

tbh, I'm not sure if any can be done or not, but iirc the if does cover all assets

in the future years where it could go significantly higher, some major efforts become possible. so while it isnt a big deal for now (how to allocate excess funds wisely), i think in the future a big part of NN success is the value gained from this extra funds

[06-Apr-19 08:35 AM] Ludom#5832
It'll be in Lisbon

[06-Apr-19 08:35 AM] Ludom#5832
In september

[06-Apr-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so for NN that are not able/willing to manage their own bounty fund, then donating to Indenodes fund is possible

[06-Apr-19 08:36 AM] Ludom#5832
Yes it's possible to donate but we don't ask for it

[06-Apr-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
just making suggestions for NN candidates about a better usage of funds than bribes to voters

[06-Apr-19 08:37 AM] Ludom#5832
We allow 1/4 of our NN revenue to the found

[06-Apr-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
I noticed indenodes has a significant amount of unclaimed rewards blocks

[06-Apr-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
you doing anything special?

[06-Apr-19 08:38 AM] Ludom#5832
And we controle assets from the Nxt community fund

[06-Apr-19 08:38 AM] Ludom#5832
Yop, I pray the great satoshi every morning

[06-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Ludom#5832
Without kidding, it's just luck

[06-Apr-19 08:40 AM] Ludom#5832
It's already enough difficult to perform in notarization to try to catch the unclaimed rewards

[06-Apr-19 08:40 AM] Ludom#5832
And we are the only group that controle 4 nodes

[06-Apr-19 08:41 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@jl777c for clarity, you define "bribes" as going directly to voters and %age to dev funds and the like are not that, correct?

[06-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Ludom#5832
It gives us 4 more chances to claim the good reward as a single node

[06-Apr-19 08:41 AM] TonyL#3577
`can we make a list of candidates not offering bribes`

```Part of the NN rewards I'm planning to spend on different testing bounties and community activities. For example ROGUE freeroll tournaments, crypto-conditions Tetris championship, crypto conditions modules testing bounties and so on.```

I plan to make a bounty fund for CCs and other apps testing / competitions

[06-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Ludom#5832
I'm really waiting on Rogue

[06-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Ludom#5832
So much possibility to make bounties

[06-Apr-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
More games are coming what means more possibilities for bounties and e-sports like competitions

[06-Apr-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
paying for votes directly is what I am against

unless your "devs" just happen to all be the ones that voted for you

[06-Apr-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
now for devs that are also NN, paying for your time that you could otherwise billout for, this seems ok to. ie. directly developing useful things for the ecosystem

[06-Apr-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so really all I am against is saying "vote for me and X% will be kicked back to the ones that do"

[06-Apr-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, technical skill is the most valuable thing for an NN

[06-Apr-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but when the tech part becomes easy, then it is the usage of excess funds that will likely sway voters like me

[06-Apr-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
at scale, I view each NN as a decentralized (at least distributed 64 ways) source of funds for the ecosystem
