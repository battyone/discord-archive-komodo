Hmm on beer... When consolidating on second node u guys are ignoring the large utxos right?

fwiw, here's a stupidly simple script to send funds away and restart with fresh wallets

@blackjok3r  yes

[12-Apr-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool just a thought, as if the other node spent the utxo then it is spent and will not appear in listunspent

[12-Apr-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my 2nd node used the fact that the UTXOs were a different format, so the size didn't matter

{Reactions}
🤔 

[12-Apr-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes mine works the same... But any send to address changes utxo type to p2pkh

[12-Apr-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r I'm guessing the "stuck" UTXOs were related to the manual add wallet filter, it's better now after zap

[12-Apr-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... Using wallet filter could easily fuk things up when not used properly... The point of it is to make the attack not worth  it... So it never happens in the first place

[12-Apr-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe if it was noted how many nodes each candidate is already autoelected for that would help?

in theory, if the import scanner works, a bootstrap shouldn't be fekable

[12-Apr-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's not to say that you can't dl a non-boostrap posing as one

[12-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
the thing is without any utxo even with a bad reimport I believe the fake spend would just be rejected

[12-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
*without any legit utxo*

[12-Apr-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure if komodo does or not, but I know that if you take an archive and name it bootstrap.dat Core client will run it

[12-Apr-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the danger bits

[12-Apr-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo

[12-Apr-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
not true

[12-Apr-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
ANY valid chain in the bootstrap would be accepted

[12-Apr-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
contact with other nodes is needed to identify the real chain

[12-Apr-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"valid" being the operative word, no?

[12-Apr-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, there's that

[12-Apr-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes valid, but that means you can remove any tx you like from the chain

[12-Apr-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
like the one where you emptied an address that you have

[12-Apr-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
then send a tx that double spends that and the node with the valid but wrong bootstrap wont be able to tell

[12-Apr-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_burnt 10k of CoinX running a sapling script on a sprout chain because he didn't read **his own** code_

[12-Apr-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it would even see it in its mempool and the wallet might even update balance if unconfirmed are enabled

[12-Apr-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
then if it is being mined, then it would even look like it is confirmed

[12-Apr-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so there are definitely dangers with bootstraps

💯 

[12-Apr-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but you'd still have to connect to only that network and ban legit nodes for that, no?

[12-Apr-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but if the chain length is very different, it could end up just banning the valid nodes

[12-Apr-19 02:51 PM] SHossain#0007
it just took me 2 hours today to sync all chains from scratch (except PIRATE) in a server.

[12-Apr-19 02:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Referring to the conversation earlier. Decker knows their list isnt accurate. They said they just pulled from the repo. 
Chmex list is very similar to the one I made. Ill double check it later today for greater accuracy. I would say that NN candidates need to help themselves and provide accurate information and make sure the list has their data on it.

[12-Apr-19 02:52 PM] zatJUM#9924

```
from the output  of  `komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER getinfo` ?  blocks & longestchain are both correct though.
