why not use that 50% more productively

[17-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a non-starter for me

[17-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
especially with lack of testnet results

[17-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it just looks like a pay for votes and that doesnt do the ecosystem any good

[17-Apr-19 09:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
50% towards `vote for me` != 50% towards `Make Ecosystem Greater Again and Again`
vote `MEGAA`, vote Dragonhound 🐲  🐶

there are operators who are just very good at keeping the nodes operative,   writing cool  scripts that automate stuff and make the processes more fluid

[17-Apr-19 09:49 AM] jeezy#3408
and then there are operators who also do that AND can code higher languages and contributing even more to the environment

[17-Apr-19 09:50 AM] jeezy#3408
I think season 3  of notary nodes will refine  these  people / groups even more and  make the system more resilient

[17-Apr-19 09:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
TBH, there are plenty here with skills beyond mine, but they're all great teachers. Thanks to that my skills now compared to 12 months ago are much improved, but there is still much ahead to learn

[17-Apr-19 09:53 AM] jeezy#3408
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator   yes, and thats totally fine.  its also not always a good thing.  if you can code c/c++ and can contribute even more to KMD thats good, but you can also get sidetracked easily and  get  dug up in deep holes for weeks like @dukeleto  usually does, thats were I  come in,  trying  to  provide  as stable as possible nodes with my limited crypto time as possible

[17-Apr-19 09:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
its a team effort. many paths to contribution, difficult to cover all or even learn all. As long as we collaborate and learn from each other, we all get better and so does the ecosystem

[17-Apr-19 11:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
and some of the underlying concepts

[17-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
true value is what you ll learn, the real one is what you can learn and develop with that and what you Ill bring to the ecosystem

IMO doing is the only way to learn

[17-Apr-19 12:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
in that respect, docs only take you so far

Plus super busy to follow conversation.  I was hoping to have a chain notarise for testing a HF and port change if testnet hasn’t day be that already.  Maybe next week

if you can teach smtg you likely master it. if you don t, teach it until you gave all the answers

I'm not sure what's not been covered. Check Jok3r's pin, and Web's page. UTXO management has been discussed extensively, and there anre numerous methods of going about it

[17-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
and then you realize you re just a noob playing with cli

being able to read code like a native langauge helps a lot

[17-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
this is just needed at first for bash

[17-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
or py

[17-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
and a grep can explain a lot provided you know Hat to search in the code

[17-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
for example, iguana ban

is it normal to be constantly flooded by utxos ? I mean what s the goal ?

[17-Apr-19 12:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
@blackjok3r what do u use for C/C++? found code::blocks to be good as it has all needed integrated & customizable.. compiler, debug, compiling flags, etc

[17-Apr-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol... I search project and look for it... Then rsync to VM and they to build and use compiler rage to debug it

@Deleted User i may rebuild a proxmox machine this weekend.. depending on the question i might help

[17-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
the first purpose was to test reactivity and after that a whitelist solution but now, are those dust really needed ?

[17-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
the problem with proxmox compared to vmware is that it seems to handle hw very differently and vm just crash if am too brutal

[17-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
even underprovisionning

[17-Apr-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
VMware on never ending trial is fine if u can use cli

[17-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
like there is no real stopper for individual vm, they seem to cannibalize

OK, after receiving some advice, we have decided to modify the terms of our candidature, so we will destinate the 50% of our rewards to support projects in the Komodo network (40% for CHIPS and 10% for a KMD project development fund).

[17-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean I feel like resource allocation don t place safeguards to burning vm

[17-Apr-19 12:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
instead of proxmox, have u tried running xen in a centos box?

[17-Apr-19 12:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
i find that really stable for virt

[17-Apr-19 12:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
In fact I love vmware, really but that softraid thing is just stupid

[17-Apr-19 12:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
One question I have and maybe somebody knows.
KMD height.89520 mod.20 VINI.0 myind.2 MINE
when you are the first to sign? the transaction meaning your are VINI.0 does that mean you are the one who started the notarization?

[17-Apr-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I don't think the data strict knows who was fist to sign, because each node would see that differently due to network latency

[17-Apr-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As soon as your node has all the SIG's it sends the tx, whether u participated or not

[17-Apr-19 12:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
I see thanks

[17-Apr-19 12:40 PM] PHBA2061#2530
we're having double nota on BEER again, and whenever it happens, it seems that nodes are separated into 2 groups, each  group can't see the other's mask

[17-Apr-19 12:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
that why I am not seeming to notarize any BEER ?

[17-Apr-19 01:00 PM] gt#2812
if anything that would mean you'd have a better chance

[17-Apr-19 01:02 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061  can double notas happen on mainet of NN ? If both NN groups notarize the same chain/fork it is fine. If they are not on the same chain, I think that it can be an issue

[17-Apr-19 01:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm not a NN operator on mainnet, so I don't think I have the right to answer that question  😃 .  But on testnet, I think we are all on correct BEER chain.

[17-Apr-19 02:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@blackjok3r the `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}"` command only shows mask for BEER chain right ? do you know what should be added in order to show mask for PIZZA & TXSCLCC ?

[17-Apr-19 02:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I tried adding `\"coin\":\""PIZZA"\"` but it doesn't work

[17-Apr-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U can't change the mask unless u recompile iguana with dpows[] with a diff number

[17-Apr-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It defaults to 0

[17-Apr-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Which us what ever one u called first

[17-Apr-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess if u call them in a diff oder on iguana start u can force a diff coin?

[17-Apr-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When there is a diff pubkey added

[17-Apr-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or any thing else that may cause node to disagree anything could happen

[17-Apr-19 02:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
sorry the full command is `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]`    to display the recvmask & bestmask
