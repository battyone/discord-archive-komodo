it seems that @CHMEX just added TXSCLCC on notarystats.info/testnet

@mrlynch my PR isn't merged yet so I'm not notarising, but my dedictd server hardware is pretty old - ddr3 memory and 2 cpus back from 2013

it will do it pretty fast. You can also go manual an duse a cron job to split utxo

[01-Apr-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you already have c`leanwallettransactions` so wallet reset is no longer a problem... thats the number1 thing. 
To use it effectivly requires some clever utxo managment. The deepest utxo in the chain limits what can be cleared... so try not to keep old utxos (I use 1000 blocks or so, seems fine tbh) 
This needs to be done with external scripts. Then you can use my iguana if your feeling brave...

just clone that repo into another folder then build it. `./build_iguana`
copy the iguana binary to thge same place the old iguana was `agents/iguana` 
comment out the clang lines of m_notary_testnet so it doesnt build the old one again. 
nospilt is on by default like in LABS... its basically LABS iguana with some changes for MoMoM reverted

the iguana seems solid tbh. There was one bug where it was mixin up mempory structs but I fixed it with some clever mutexe's. Please anyone who uses this iguana be on the lookout for -26 errors when it tries to send transactions. VERY IMPORTANT! to report this if you see it 🙏

[01-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Lumbi#8378
anyone else getting this at the end of a dpow_sigscheck? mismatched txid.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 vs {"result":null,"error":{"code":-26,"message":"16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)"},"id":"jl777"}

[01-Apr-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That means you have no utxo

[01-Apr-19 12:23 PM] CrisF#3405
I might give your Iguana a go if things get really bad later.  For the moment will do as has been suggested and wait.
I figure putting up with frustration is good practice too.
Be good to get a feel for how long things can take and prepare for that on mainnet.

[01-Apr-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
learning how things work is a good idea before starting to use optimized thigns... without the right scripts to compliment it it wont work very well

[01-Apr-19 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah.  Figure this is part of the training, too.

Hi @blackjok3r cleanwallettransactions is a komodo-cli command? How does it work exactly?

[01-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Strob#3417
Now I am notarizing all 3 chain finally but for a total of 1 notarization each 20 or 30 minutes... which is slow.

[01-Apr-19 12:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes
the short answer is that it dumps out all old wallet data that you don't need for things like this

[01-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Strob#3417
Ok and it works with assetchains too?

[01-Apr-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes it deals directly with the wallet.dat file

[01-Apr-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`it removes all transactions deeper in the chain than the last unspent utxo`

[01-Apr-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So you lose transaction histroy but not coins... At least you shouldnt lsoe coins ... Someone has reported mined KMD can be deleted before it has matured. So to use it safly, mine on a seperate KMD node, and dont use the RPC there.

[01-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Strob#3417
Ok wow!

[01-Apr-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Someone has reported mined KMD can be deleted before it has matured.`
I've not seen that

[01-Apr-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
guess it's "hit and miss" on that one?

[01-Apr-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think ti was @Deleted User  I never saw it either... I think keeping a utxo older than 100 confirms would preventy that ever happening... I use 1000 blocks as a cut off on mine.

[01-Apr-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
after 1000 confirm it merges the utxo

[01-Apr-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Apr-19 12:50 PM] Strob#3417
With cleanwallettransactions you can use a cut off?

[01-Apr-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in code, I think
txid is the only arg that help lists

[01-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to manage utxos externally

[01-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the RPC just removes all transction that can safley be removed without corrupting the wallet

[01-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Strob#3417
ah ok only for utxo

[01-Apr-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ komodo-cli help cleanwallettransactions
cleanwallettransactions "txid"
Remove all txs that are spent. You can clear all txs bar one, by specifiying a txid.
Please backup your wallet.dat before running this command.
Arguments:
1. "txid"    (string, optional) The transaction id to keep.```

[01-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Strob#3417
ok it's sdocumented in the help. cool

[01-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Strob#3417
I didn't see it in the doc

[01-Apr-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When you split... you take what should be a single utxo in your wallet and make it into 51 (for example) once all of the 0.0001 utxos are spent, you split the single utxo again... after that the first split can be removeed from the wallet.

[01-Apr-19 12:53 PM] CrisF#3405
@CHMEX, thanks for adding the new chain1  fyi position 9 and 10 seem to be switch now.
