@grewalsatinder can you make it so it fetches the data from the official repo? this would be optimal.

[07-Mar-19 02:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can, but Gitbook markdown has some of it's editing changes as you can see in it's git repo

[07-Mar-19 02:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the old proposals might be looking different there.

[07-Mar-19 02:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me check

[07-Mar-19 02:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@grewalsatinder we are ready to make our proposal in the next week +-

[07-Mar-19 02:30 AM] kolo#1111
@grewalsatinder can you please not promote your repo, so we wont have mess with original repo. Im waiting for some nifty submission in official repo to try same solution or maybe even yours.

[07-Mar-19 02:31 AM] kolo#1111
So far only couple updates to old pages and not a single one (fresh) with lots of data as I expect

[07-Mar-19 02:32 AM] kolo#1111
You can PR to official repo also, I will not bite. As long as nothing is changed in folder notarynodes

[07-Mar-19 02:32 AM] kolo#1111
@FishyGuts all pages PRs should be there until 1st april

[07-Mar-19 02:32 AM] kolo#1111

[07-Mar-19 02:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But if Gitbook needs to be used the structure of the repo needs update.
That will auto update as per the changes made in Gitbook, and those who uses just Git, can follow that editing managing of folders/files pattern

[07-Mar-19 02:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
This link is so far just to check how it will look like using existing repo

[07-Mar-19 02:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Sorry wrong chat!

[07-Mar-19 07:26 AM] jorian#4555
i'm a bit surprised by letting komodo get all scattered over the place again. KMD is being rebranded, we have the opportunity to finally converge all what KMD is and isn't and put that information on a single location komodoplatform.com. ```This project is best kept separate from our main domain as for example we got the rebrand coming and a new site.``` why?

[07-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Audo#5667
@jorian that's my thinking at the momemt because we all want to keep the election process as decentralized as possible, so thus an independent website works nicely. That gitbook tools seems really useful here as with it all candidates can push updates to the website independently. We will look into that more.

There is also a lot of content we could have on that website, and it is much more focused when it's sitting on its own site versus being on the main Komodo domain. On the new rebrand website we can have a short section about notary nodes / elections, and then link to the official election site/process (based on Github).

Makes sense? üòÉ

[07-Mar-19 12:50 PM] kolo#1111
I don‚Äôt know why so much publishing wanted around this elections. It‚Äôs outside of my control and guidance. I will keep looking for proposals in github repo. And definitely won‚Äôt change any election rules now.

[07-Mar-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
agreed. a single official source, however many derived sites from that, which cant be stopped anyway

proposals need a 2019 sub-folder, am i correct?   will put a placeholder later if so to get the ball rolling

[07-Mar-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was confused by that too so havent done anythign yet

[07-Mar-19 10:46 PM] kolo#1111
@Notary-Operator just a bit of corrections:
- You need to have folder named after your team (not `komodo-cats-team` but just `cats` - exactly as your node will be named in pubkeys list except region _XX) inside `notarynodes` folder. 
- This is not proposals listing, this is any team getinfo page, that will persist after elections. Way to get information on any node, team or operator. It doesn't matter if there are folders of team with  no nodes, with only proposal or from mature heads like badass. There is also my cat's page. Having folder there doesn't affect elections (not having it affects  :)
- Please, DO NOT remove non-yours old folders, do not touch proposals directory (some might need it to recover their old data), do not commit to other folders there or change files structure.

And you have to make page. It is one and only *official* source of candidates data.

Spoiler: pages deadline 1 april. Declaring automatic re-elected nodes between 1st and 14th apr. Votes airdrop 14th apr, voting deadline 14th may, hardforking pubkeys - mid june. 30 nodes will be re-elected, 30 nodes elected, 4 dev nodes. Top 30 (from all) re-elected nodes define count of free per region spots. I will announce that all soon.

[07-Mar-19 10:48 PM] kolo#1111
Please, forgive not always answering long and detailed. Multiwindow battling on how it should be done is a bit too late. We promised not to change any rules significantly since last year.
Will have hours to explain everyone asking why something is done the way it's done, but after elections üòÉ

A little bit confused:  Is it necessary to create now folders/records till April 1st only for active NN or candidates too? (found announce in other channel but only notary nodes tagged everywhere - thats why confusion presists)
Upd: started to read announce - and my question is resolved now üòÉ

@kolo   please clarify this Top 30 (from all) re-elected nodes define count of free per region spots.

[08-Mar-19 11:41 AM] Mylo#8306
@jorian i read it differently to you.  it says "...it doesn't matter if there are teams with no nodes , with only proposals..." so if he plans on making a proposal, he needs to be in that folder.

perhaps misread earlier this week, I thought we had until April 1st to have page submitted

[08-Mar-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo I am going to try to interpret your "Top 30 (from all) re-elected nodes define count of free per region spots" statement, because it has people confused, but I *think* I know what you mean

[08-Mar-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
of all nodes who are re-elected (top half of each region), place the top 30 into each of the 4 regions. The empty spots left behind define how many empty slots are in that specific region

[08-Mar-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo some people think you are saying "the top 30 nodes globally get re-elected", which would be a big change from what was said previously

[08-Mar-19 07:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
for aspiring node operators shall we put the proposal in first?

I will follow this election this year, sounds exciting! How many candidates are you expecting this year? Last year there were only 50 right? I may even be greatly interested in running a node myself one day since I do have plenty of powerful servers doing mostly nothing since I switched my render farm from cpu to gpu and since Komodo recently became such a passion for me. How much time should a notary node operator expect to have to put in his node maintenance? I run a node for Ravencoin (no reward, just for fun) but this is so easy I won't even compare it to a KMD NN.

[09-Mar-19 01:37 AM] Mylo#8306
"Lazy" operator, average, excellent about 20,50,100+ hrs per month.
First year learning curve is high.
Also depends how much scripting and tuning you do to continually optimize and compete.

I am an experienced and self sufficient systems / networking admin as well as an effective project planner and service responder. Graduated college over 12 years ago now and I've been operating as an independent contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in selling, planning, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, servicing and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems. I've never had a boss, just a handful of regular trusting and happy clients. I'm very happy to make myself part of the KMD community efforts by assisting newcomers where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience. I joined this KMD discord channel within the first day it came online and can be counted on to remain present and involved here throughout NN upkeep. I'm ready and willing to work hard to keep a single node up and running at it's best. I'm a true KMD believer. Currently holding as much as I can afford to but will need help from community to get enough votes to earn a node.

VOTE2019 is only valid if it's been in 1 tx (i think).  so if you get vote, send it to someone, and they vote - it's not counted.

Do we have a date people can start voting aka airdrop date? 
Was it decided the tokens can only be moved once?  I mean, people can still buy votes like this I guess but it won't be as easy.
What about users with multiple wallets, will they have to use each wallet and send votes there?
