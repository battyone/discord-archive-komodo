first run will create oracle for nn, second run (20 min later) will populate oracle with pingstats

[18-May-19 10:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@deleted-role pls run @mrlynch 's  `./iguanaping` to add ping data to the above

Is it precompiled binary in repo?

[18-May-19 12:24 PM] zatJUM#9924
What's the use of this, knowing they're only testnet servers?

thanks @TonyL yep binary precompiled in repo. 
I thinks your oracle is created, if you run it again it'll add to table / graph

[18-May-19 12:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@zatJUM testnet nodes are less geographically dispersed so ping data varies more than mainnet, and most ops are using mostly same setups. Makes the data more indicative for seeing how ping correlates to ntx count.

[18-May-19 12:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
also, testing this here means can apply to mainnet if required

[18-May-19 12:51 PM] TonyL#3577
I think for safety reasons it's better to make such tool for NNs as some scripts rather than precompiled binary, but it's just imo

[18-May-19 12:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can build if want, source is in repo too

[18-May-19 12:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Yay, I'm in table

`thought that helps people who lives in remote area`
It really depends on what you're doing
for "normal" people, the speed bump is awesome
so much of what I've done since 2002 has been "real time" stuff that it's actually worse because of the nature of how it works

man, now we have this tool... we can actially try changes to the code to "attempt fixing" the problem.  Likely it will need a controlled testnet, by only a hand full of people maybe., to ensure everything else is kept as equal as possible.

That's a similar graph to PHBA2061 and I also, @zatJUM .

the table on oracle.earth is showing a pretty clear correlation with average of averages and counts so far...

[18-May-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can create a contraolled test for this and find a solution.

[18-May-19 05:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
been mining my 1st vanity address for 9 hours and just realized I put the wrong pattern 🤦
then I restarted with the correct pattern and got the result after 10 secs 😂

_looks at the current results of the ping table and concludes that the result will show that pings are relatively meaningless_

💯 

[18-May-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
didnt look at the results as there is more than a second for the packets to come in and all are treated equally

[18-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i have said ping time doesnt really matter all along

[18-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is more than a second

[18-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
or your are blocking specific nodes

[18-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
or have horrible bandwidth

[18-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is good to have it confirmed, which means the code is working as expected

sometimes the best experiments prove what you already know/think/believe 😎

It never hurts to vizualize data in many ways like this. sometimes theory and practice don't always match exactly.

[18-May-19 08:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
geez.. you were busy. been caught up with irl stuff.. so happy to see that my modest script is being put to use 😀 and we can put the ping thing to bed

thank you all for providing the dataz

[18-May-19 10:48 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @SHossain, @mrlynch , fyi - just in case.  If you run the oracle script a second time your data will be added to the oracle that the first run created.  Then it will appear on the visualization.

[18-May-19 10:48 PM] SHossain#0007
i see

[18-May-19 10:48 PM] SHossain#0007
ok will run again

a zoom button would be nice. can't see my node in the graph 😅
