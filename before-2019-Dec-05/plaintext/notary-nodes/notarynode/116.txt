`On that note. Having a node in Australia when everyone else is in the northern hemisphere hurts.`
That was one of the issues I'd hope to solve (or at least lessen) with having 3

But I heard from others who do that with one node with funds and a second 1 without funds just to help peering

[11-Apr-19 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if "under the same ip" means same external, chances are 1 will end up dormant
if "under the same ip" means on the same server with no VMs, chances are it will all go bad or 1 will not work at all

my bet is that any "gains" you were told about are merely confirmation bias

ok

[11-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Strob my setup is : block anything but iguana on main NN cause it s role is NN. and to provide to the community a full peer I have a second node with ports opened

[11-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Strob#3417
ok

[11-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Strob#3417
Anyway my goal was just swapping server to try new hardware

[11-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Strob#3417
but I wanted to make sure everything was setup correctly before swapping

[11-Apr-19 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s just like renting a server just to keep it in sync and share with people who need peers

If we are going to put a list together, it may as well be accurate. I think the repo needs looking at now, as it is the central point.

until ~ 4 hrs ago, I'm actually having better luck with 4G in one location than 8G in a different location

No chainmakers @Decker ?

[11-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Decker#3767
@siu - Chainmakers ... of course i would like to mentione more teams and peoples ... chaimakers, pirates, meshbits with grewal ... computergenie ... chmex ... and everybody who made a good contribution to our community. That's why is too hard to recommend something, to that no one is offended ... üò¶

[11-Apr-19 09:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hehe no offence here.

[11-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Decker#3767
So, seems here is only one correct recommendation ... read proposals and choose your own heroes )

should we add our team names to our names in this server or that not important?

[11-Apr-19 09:51 PM] Decker#3767
If you guess that is important for voters - add it ...

[11-Apr-19 09:53 PM] Greer#0666
I was thinking more for other teams and devs to know who is who

Computer says no.

Personally my opinion, nickname like %name_[team]% is good, but something like %name_vote_for_us_bcz_we_are_very_cool_and_many_many_hearts_or_other_symbols% looks scary )
