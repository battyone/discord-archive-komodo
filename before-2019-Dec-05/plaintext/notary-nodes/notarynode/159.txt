combining* 😫 ☕

[19-Apr-19 05:12 PM] Greer#0666
I thought combing was a term I hadn't learned yet.  Going with that from now on.

I see less notas on TXSCLCC, what do you think about it ? https://notarystats.info/testnet.php

[19-Apr-19 08:56 PM] phm87#7395
@deleted-role  sorry to ping you guys but can you check your TXSCLCC ?
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC listunspent | jq length

[19-Apr-19 08:57 PM] phm87#7395
I hope that only my node is affected

[19-Apr-19 08:58 PM] jorian#4555
listunspent is local

yes I know but I though it was a new dwy attack

[19-Apr-19 08:59 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder phm was scared of dust attack

[19-Apr-19 08:59 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[19-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
or maybe you're using auto split inadvertently

[19-Apr-19 08:59 PM] phm87#7395
yes I broke something, that's the good news

[19-Apr-19 08:59 PM] phm87#7395
but about TXSCLCC, do you think that there was nota recently ?

[19-Apr-19 09:00 PM] phm87#7395
and @Alright  did you fix the splitted NN testnet network ?

[19-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
you can see it happen if you take a look at dexstats ranks and see multiple rounds of notarizations happening simultaneously

[19-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
so like 14 people notarizing a couple minutes apart on the same chain

[19-Apr-19 09:03 PM] phm87#7395
sigh ... I complain then a nota on TXSCLCC happened  blocks ago

[19-Apr-19 09:04 PM] phm87#7395

It would still be nice to get the extra information you had tabulated last year.

It's quite different this year

Quite interesting bitmex-like CC is coming also, maybe someobdy will want to build some project on top of it and will need notaries funding help. In general bright perspectives for borning of new projects on CCs which will need notaries help

Hi, does anyone  know if the 13 multisig signers were finalized?

[20-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Greer#0666
@mrlynch Your consolidateutxos.sh script helped me figure out the raw transactions to 'comb' my dust.  Big thank you.
I did discover a couple of issues if you're interested.  bc trims leading zero's so if you have an amount <1 the createrawtranscation will fail.  doing the math with awk worked for me.  The other thing is that jq has a limit on the size of the ARG's, so too many transactions made it fail, I couldn't be bothered to work around that so just did it in batches based on number of confs.

I got cleaned up already, but it has been very useful learning the details of things like rawtxs that I only understood broadly

[20-Apr-19 04:20 AM] Greer#0666
that one is quite a bit more complex, will get on it tomorrow.  no more late night screw ups for me for now.

@Alright listunspent call is working fine with my BEER daemon. what bug did you discover?

[20-Apr-19 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
none. It was caused by using 2 daemon at ocne with the same key imported as far as we could wrok out.

[20-Apr-19 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless this "bug" is reported again, I wont be looking at it further.

[20-Apr-19 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
couldnt reproduce it.

[20-Apr-19 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, if that's the case then it wouldn't have been me.  Only one running.

[20-Apr-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
has it come back?

"using 2 daemon at ocne with the same key imported"

[20-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
that is asking for problems

[20-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if both are sending tx, then it can easily try to double spend

[20-Apr-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes if not creating teh correct raw tx it will do that.
