Is this a txid? `KMD.2a31b051578c46e18887a196025915868e3cc27099a79b4a78c1055708722675`

`recvmask.195cfaee ` 
It may be worth adding some kind of log for these, if your getting bad notarizations on a coin, you can see if your in recvmask, although not sure how helpful it would be. 
A reasonable assumption is that if recvmask is good for one coin, it should eb the same for all...

[16-May-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
not if some notary are not running a specific coin

[16-May-19 12:00 PM] Strob#3417
Ok it's a txid. I am getting TXSCLCC.000000000000000000000 since yesterday and I am trying to figure out how I can fix it the fastest way.

That just means you did not reach consensus, `195cfaee` decode this with the masks curl

[16-May-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure your in recvmask

[16-May-19 12:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Could Strob's `000`s be related to an `AcceptToMemoryPool: inputs already spent` error?

[16-May-19 12:05 PM] CrisF#3405
`curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]` decode in here?

[16-May-19 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Strob is your TXSCLCC still in sync? any errors in debug?

[16-May-19 12:06 PM] Strob#3417
yes. only error is already spent error sometimes

[16-May-19 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's odd, to me, that you've only had problems with that 1 chain 🤔

[16-May-19 12:08 PM] CrisF#3405
I also had it on one chain @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 .

[16-May-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you hit the "iguana stops notarizing for no reason" bug

[16-May-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CrisF yours was on BEER though, wasn't it?

[16-May-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs a restart every 7-8 days, at least the version of mine does.

[16-May-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt think it affected iguana with small numbers of coins, but maybe it does?

[16-May-19 12:09 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, on BEER.

[16-May-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
havent noticed it on LABS really.

[16-May-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hasn't restarted since we changed minsig because he went to the bottom of the pack every time he restarted_

[16-May-19 12:10 PM] Strob#3417
I restarted iguana ow I get it on beer too

[16-May-19 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for the 1st "little while" after restart it can/will happen regularly

[16-May-19 12:12 PM] Strob#3417
My guess is rebooting will fix it. But I will try to see if I can just restart iguana multipli times instead

[16-May-19 12:13 PM] Strob#3417
or restart TSXCLCC with various option (reindex-chainstate, reindex or zappwalletxes

[16-May-19 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I generally give it at least an hr after restart before even looking at anything because it needs time to catch up and connect fully to others

[16-May-19 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I have tried to explain this before, maybe nobody understoof it or it got lost. 
WHY iguana breaks when you restart it is the KMD block exeption for AC. 
10 KMD blocks must hav past before an AC can be notarized. 
If your ndoe starts a round, that no other nodes start, how can it reach consensus for a ntoarization?

[16-May-19 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is what the 0s mean.

[16-May-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you have started a dpow round, and not enough other ndoes did.

[16-May-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it simply fails... its just how it works

[16-May-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
best way to stop this happenign is to never restart ever...

[16-May-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or restart a few times, until it randoml;y enters a round correctly

[16-May-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
WHEN you start, makes a lot of diffrence, but it is 100% luck

[16-May-19 12:15 PM] Strob#3417
Is there a way to reset everything without really restarting the machine? Like dumping memory or something?

[16-May-19 12:15 PM] Strob#3417
clearing cache?

[16-May-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent restarted my notary for 140 days 😉

[16-May-19 12:16 PM] Strob#3417
wow!

[16-May-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when there are lots of coins on mainnet... if 1 or 3 stop working for a few days its NP

[16-May-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they eventally will just fix themself.

[16-May-19 12:17 PM] Strob#3417
I see

[16-May-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you just need to get lucky enough to start the rounds at the right time... Once everything lines up, your node will be fine for a week or so.  Then iguana will probably simply stop working, requireing restart of it. 24H of slow start, then it should be abck to normal.

[16-May-19 12:18 PM] Strob#3417
But you don't clear swap, memory cache once in awhile?

[16-May-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no. Maybe thats why my node is not doing so well atm. But I really havent got time to spend on it right now... Whole thing needs to be totally reinstalled before hard fork.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Can I ask you what linux distro yu use? blackjok3r mentioned he used Debian I think? I'm looking for new distros to try (for server and desktop). So far I tried pop os, mint, about all ubuntu flavors.

[16-May-19 01:49 PM] Strob#3417
So far i prefer ubuntu mate but I feel I may find a better one...

[16-May-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Debian for servers Arch/Manjaro for desktop... ubuntu 16.04 for test VMs

[16-May-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Debian here too, I only use Ubuntu to test releases

[16-May-19 01:50 PM] Strob#3417

@blackjok3r  Yesterday at XX:XX XX
`and that number is for the node who rant he script, than add notarization count to this`
pardon the n00b q but how do i extract the ntx count for say, past 24h?

[16-May-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt CHMEX give you an api?.. may need the nodes who run it to enter their name somewhere?

[16-May-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because its testnet, no deamon RPC can really do it, as the pubkeys are not in it

[16-May-19 03:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
ah.. the api i have from chmex is nn_name: ntx count

[16-May-19 03:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
but there's no easy way to match nn to ip

[16-May-19 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, that should be ok though because the node who ran the script can just supply his name. 
We only need the average ping from a node to all other nodes, and his 24H count of notarizations.

[16-May-19 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then if the counts of notarizations generally correlate with counts we know... if its all just random. then ping doesnt matter.

[16-May-19 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will take a fair few days of data colelction for a good result.

[16-May-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but there's no easy way to match nn to ip`
For some there will not be, not all nodes on testnet are running the IP in the repo

[16-May-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a way to get them, but I think only @webworker01  can do it.  Im not sure it really matters though, we are trusting the nodes whop run it anyway, they can just supply node name. and average pings. counts can be fetched from api.
