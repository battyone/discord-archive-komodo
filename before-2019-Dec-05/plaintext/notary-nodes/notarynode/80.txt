how does the code work that allows dpow transactions to be paid faster by other notaries and take the confirmation?

[03-Apr-19 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do what?

[03-Apr-19 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, you mean priority?

[03-Apr-19 06:57 PM] Lumbi#8378
yes

[03-Apr-19 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it pays more per tx weight than "normal", so it's selected 1st

[03-Apr-19 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
until blocks are full, it's basically moot

[03-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Lumbi#8378
```it's basically moot```

[03-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Lumbi#8378
but not entirely?

[03-Apr-19 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nothing that prepares for the future is entirely moot, but all miners are going to take all fees and since our chains are low on txes per block, the chance of a tx being consistently ignored is all but nonexistent

I just have a last bug that I will once and for all eliminate, utxo shiting in the fan when on cron (but working perfectly when launched manually). I have a few ideas.

[04-Apr-19 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
likely you need to add in the script to cd to the script dir

[04-Apr-19 02:32 AM] Strob#3417
Probably. cause cron doesn't have the env set the same

[04-Apr-19 02:33 AM] Strob#3417
I replace $HOME by the full path to komodo-cli but it's not enough

[04-Apr-19 02:33 AM] Strob#3417
by the way do you know if the script lock pubkey must finish by AC or ac or doesn't matter?

[04-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Strob#3417
somewhere it says AC other ac

[04-Apr-19 02:52 AM] Strob#3417
ok it's ac : http://learnmeabitcoin.com/glossary/p2pk

After update almost not notarising. I wonder Iguana mad on me because updated only when woke up 😂

[04-Apr-19 03:04 AM] Strob#3417
After the update only my TXSC were not notarizing, so I reindexed it. It took a while sadly but after that it was notarizing and fast. got 50 TXSC since

[04-Apr-19 03:04 AM] TonyL#3577
`TXSCLCC           689.9832       8     135  182707    0.1%   4h24m      27     ` hmm have same situation on TXSCLCC

[04-Apr-19 03:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try to reindex

[04-Apr-19 03:04 AM] Strob#3417
I wonder if -reindex-chainstate would have done the job too.

[04-Apr-19 03:04 AM] Strob#3417
it's suposed to be faster

[04-Apr-19 04:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
reindex-chainstate is "faster" than reindex, because they are different functions and reindex does more work

[04-Apr-19 04:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
reindex-chainstate is basically a sub-function of reindex as a whole

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[04-Apr-19 05:31 AM] TonyL#3577
reindex helped to get notatizations constantly on this chain. Is it usual practice for operators to reindex/refresh chainstate from bootstrap to make it faster?

[04-Apr-19 05:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Good question.  I really slowed down after update.
Just did  resync to see if that helps.  If not will try reindex.

[04-Apr-19 05:39 AM] CrisF#3405
@TonyL Do you know how I can add nodes to iguana?  Been looking around the code, but don't have any idea how it fits together.

[04-Apr-19 05:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Or change the number of connections?

[04-Apr-19 05:42 AM] TonyL#3577
@CrisF If I understood your question correct: "addnotary" calls to iguana declared in `m_notary_testnet ` file - so when new notaries added on update you pull `m_notary_testnet` with additional curl rpc calls

[04-Apr-19 05:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet/blob/master/iguana/m_notary_testnet#L20

[04-Apr-19 05:43 AM] TonyL#3577
But maybe you mean connections not to iguana but to komodo daemon?

[04-Apr-19 05:43 AM] CHMEX#0686
apparently once they are set you don't have to do anything it will do connections constantly.

[04-Apr-19 05:44 AM] TonyL#3577
So
` Do you know how I can add nodes to iguana? `:
```git pull
./m_notary_testnet```

[04-Apr-19 05:45 AM] CHMEX#0686
for the daemon I changed net.cpp     MAXCONNECTIONS for 16 to 300
and than in the komodo.conf    MAXCONNECTIONS= 40

[04-Apr-19 05:45 AM] CHMEX#0686
now I have 40 connections which works pretty well

[04-Apr-19 05:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Ah, yes, I was thinking something like max connections.  In guana though. (already done in the komodo daemon)

[04-Apr-19 05:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
in iguana I think you can't change it

[04-Apr-19 05:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
there are only as many ip as operators are...

[04-Apr-19 05:48 AM] CrisF#3405
I would like to see what effect more connections would have.  I haven't been able to raise my connections above 24 (KMD).

[04-Apr-19 05:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe I misunderstood.  I thought I saw a post saying something about `iguana connections`.

[04-Apr-19 05:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Only one notarisation since resync, 40 mins ago.  Will reindex.

MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS @CHMEX

[04-Apr-19 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
and if you want a *shitload* find the sleep right before it asks for more peers

[04-Apr-19 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
set that much lower

[04-Apr-19 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
and you'll be asking all of your peers for more peers constantly

[04-Apr-19 06:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Ah, I didn't touch the sleep.  Will try that.

[04-Apr-19 06:30 AM] CrisF#3405

[04-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
but if you want a top node.....

[04-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
the problem it would create if every single notary does this is that peers are a limited resource

[04-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
there is only a finite number of peers most of which have maxconnections=8

[04-Apr-19 06:33 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm interested to see what the effect is.  With 23 ~24 peers I've had periods of high notarizations.  Wondering if this will have more of an effect than changing utxo had.

[04-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
I can tell you right now, that after a day or two of this, your counts will go up

[04-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
everyone do it 😄 see what happens

[04-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
you basically want to position your node as a central relay node for blocks

[04-Apr-19 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
and if you do, you will have them first and get more notarizations

[04-Apr-19 06:37 AM] Alright#0419
98 peers on my KMD node to give you some perspective

[04-Apr-19 06:38 AM] Alright#0419
51 on BEER, 53 on PIZZA, 23 on TXSCLCC

[04-Apr-19 06:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that's better than my 23KMD connections.
I've changed it.  Will see how it goes. Thanks.

[04-Apr-19 07:28 AM] Strob#3417
Finally got that autosplit to work in cron!

{Reactions}
💯 👌 

[04-Apr-19 07:29 AM] CrisF#3405
what got it working?

[04-Apr-19 07:30 AM] Strob#3417
the grep is not working with cron. I was using that line cause at first I thought the jq was not working (line 57-58

[04-Apr-19 07:31 AM] Strob#3417
In fact it was the NN pubkey that we must input corectly for it to work. We must add 21 before and ac after (not AC) to get what is called a lock script pubkey

[04-Apr-19 07:31 AM] Strob#3417
the  jq seems to be compatible with cron

[04-Apr-19 07:34 AM] Strob#3417
I tried to make cron to print this line every 1 minute ```komodo-cli listunspent | grep .0001 | wc -l```

[04-Apr-19 07:35 AM] Strob#3417
it gives 0 instead of my utxo number which was 20.

[04-Apr-19 07:35 AM] Strob#3417
If I enter the command in the terminal it gives 20 but in cron it gives 0!

[04-Apr-19 07:39 AM] Strob#3417
My peers are far better than before now: 
```css
-CHAIN-     -NOTR- -LASTN- -UTXO-    -BAL-   -BLOX- -LASTB- -CON- -SIZE-

[04-Apr-19 07:47 AM] Strob#3417
Look if we use AC like the decker comment says we get 0 while ac was giving me 18!! 
```css

~/Desktop$ komodo-cli listunspent | jq '[.[] | select (.generated==false and .amount==0.0001 and .spendable==true and (.scriptPubKey == "'2187jh763105a5771042d9jhjhjhjhjhjjhjh03e16acaf877877878787878uiuha7bAC'"))] | length'
0

if you do the peer net.ccp hack, please mention it here. Am curious of how much of an effect it will have

[04-Apr-19 07:54 AM] Alright#0419
especially curious to see what happens if many people do it

[04-Apr-19 08:00 AM] CrisF#3405
@Strob Took me a bit to figure out the pubkey, too.  Seemed to cron for me me though.
