actually thats what I think I have, I'll check that.

that's what you need I think

[05-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Greer#0666
yup

[05-Apr-19 09:04 PM] VoskCoin#1869
what port(s) need to be open for TXSCLCC?

[05-Apr-19 09:05 PM] VoskCoin#1869

`>>>>>>>>>> TXSCLCC: p2p.51797 rpc.51798 magic.31ff4671 838813297 0 coins`

[05-Apr-19 09:06 PM] VoskCoin#1869
also TCP or UDP?

[05-Apr-19 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
TCP I assume, I can't remember the last time I used UDP for anything 🤷🏽

[05-Apr-19 09:08 PM] zatJUM#9924
DNS?

[05-Apr-19 09:08 PM] VoskCoin#1869

komodo build failing, then just run the build again until it works is really a thing huh?

[05-Apr-19 09:16 PM] zatJUM#9924
make clean first

[05-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Greer#0666
4th try first time around, 2nd this time

[05-Apr-19 09:17 PM] Greer#0666
yeah, did 😃

[05-Apr-19 09:26 PM] PHBA2061#2530
why did it fail then ?

[05-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Greer#0666
I forget now, I think it was complaining about libcrypto.h this time.  I saw a comment here to just keep retrying, so did and it eventually worked.  This time was second time, a couple of days ago took four tries

[05-Apr-19 09:38 PM] Greer#0666
I've been starting the three assetchains manually is there a scripted way to do that or does everyone just create their own way?  ```komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=PIZZA -ac_supply=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146```
then again for BEER and TXSCLCC

[05-Apr-19 09:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
most of us did it manually

[05-Apr-19 09:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
don't forget the "&" at the end of the command

[05-Apr-19 09:40 PM] PHBA2061#2530
but CG has an automatic script if I remember correctly

[05-Apr-19 09:40 PM] Greer#0666
I been running it in screen (dont tell @VoskCoin I shunned him for doing that on a LOKI node)

[05-Apr-19 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

thank you!  I wish I'd asked for that yesterday.

[05-Apr-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
take out the `&>KMD.out` type bits if you don't want the outputs to go to files

[05-Apr-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_logs all kinds of shit_

[05-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Greer#0666
different to the debug.log's?

[05-Apr-19 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
normally when you run the daemon, you see stuff in the terminal (the 'stdout'), I log that instead of displaying it

[05-Apr-19 09:47 PM] Greer#0666
I thought that was what was going into ~/.komodo/BEER/debug.log, I'll take a look, sounds useful

[05-Apr-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
totally different things

[05-Apr-19 09:49 PM] SHossain#0007
@Greer you need to replace `$pubkey` with your own pubkey

[05-Apr-19 09:49 PM] SHossain#0007
for all coins

[05-Apr-19 09:50 PM] Greer#0666
getting that read from the textfile

[05-Apr-19 09:50 PM] SHossain#0007
then, you are ok

[05-Apr-19 09:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_figured `yourpubkeyhere` was self-explanatory :P_

[05-Apr-19 09:50 PM] Greer#0666
it was self-explanatory but appreciate the extra clarification too

[05-Apr-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
just stop daemon and start with reindex

[05-Apr-19 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

who maintains the list of notarizations?  We are more that 20 nodes ATM.

[05-Apr-19 09:58 PM] NNoperator#3835
it will be nice to be able to follow along with the new additions when I get started.

[05-Apr-19 10:04 PM] SHossain#0007
CHMEX manages that

do you need such a strong high end server for testnet?

[05-Apr-19 10:32 PM] SHossain#0007
Alright is on 1444

[05-Apr-19 10:33 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
He was probably the first one notarising

[05-Apr-19 10:33 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Alright's had as much luck as me in the last 3 hours `181    95    73`

@And1_89  last year it was a competition of sorts, so prospective operators came out strong.  Others choose to set up what they plan to run for the mainnet 2019.  The voters are watching, so you want to make a good impression.

[05-Apr-19 10:46 PM] Lumbi#8378
last TXSC  1502  !!! ???

[05-Apr-19 10:48 PM] SHossain#0007
i agree with @NNoperator. testnet is a nice way to show that you are capable of running mainnet properly 😃

[05-Apr-19 10:48 PM] NNoperator#3835
holy cow.  I got on the board.  My node was seen  (-:

aw_yeah unicorn 👀 

[05-Apr-19 10:49 PM] NNoperator#3835
@Lumbi  do you have  TXSCLCC  UTXOs?  Is your chain up to the latest?

[05-Apr-19 10:50 PM] NNoperator#3835
I'm going to fire it back up, maybe I can get a beer to go with the pizza?

[05-Apr-19 10:51 PM] SHossain#0007
little strange. 2 sets of notarizations in a single block https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/block/002f17eedd94cbb54a23c1b65df3af1a5506f891d27f8b8507f7a5bb1a0dcf53

[05-Apr-19 10:53 PM] SHossain#0007
it seems there are 2 different groups now into this testnet?

[05-Apr-19 10:53 PM] NNoperator#3835
split network?

[05-Apr-19 10:54 PM] NNoperator#3835
I wonder if one of the two groups is made up of nodes that haven't updated yet?

[05-Apr-19 10:55 PM] Lumbi#8378
@NNoperator looks like it... restarted and cleaned the wallet

2 more notarizations by different groups with couple of blocks interval

[05-Apr-19 10:55 PM] Lumbi#8378
TXSC is buggy on my node

[05-Apr-19 10:55 PM] SHossain#0007
that is not happening in mainnet though (haven't seen anything like that yet)

[05-Apr-19 10:55 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I am in my bed with phone don't see 2 in same block

[05-Apr-19 10:55 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Ah à few blocks interval

[05-Apr-19 10:56 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, 2 different blocks with 2 blocks interval

[05-Apr-19 10:56 PM] SHossain#0007
that is too close to each other rather than normal 10 blocks

[05-Apr-19 10:56 PM] SHossain#0007
not like it is harmful

[05-Apr-19 10:57 PM] SHossain#0007
but seems strange

[05-Apr-19 10:57 PM] NNoperator#3835

@NNoperator you may be right to guess that there are non-updated nodes

[05-Apr-19 10:59 PM] NNoperator#3835
We were plagued with this in mainnet a while back,  IIRC it was due to non-updated nodes
