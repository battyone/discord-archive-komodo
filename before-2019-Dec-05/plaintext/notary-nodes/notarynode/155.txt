I performed quite good at first (24h/48h). Then with each update  (when new NN adding) - worse, worse, worse

[18-Apr-19 02:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, that happened to me once before, & I don't understand why

`would running different daemons have anything to do with it?` - hmm I'm using FSM daemon, have to try to switch on `beta` I think
Also using "standart" iguana
