I need someone to help rewriting assetchains file to add RFOX parameter (ac_reward)

[26-Jun-18 11:24 PM] PTYX#6840
What is RFOX?

[27-Jun-18 12:34 AM] kolo#1111
It's a new asset. We have total of 3 new coins upcoming to add to notarization, but all 3 appear to have things needed to adjust before announcing.

[27-Jun-18 12:35 AM] kolo#1111
RFOX will be easiest, I just need to fix assetchains file.

[27-Jun-18 12:48 AM] PTYX#6840
Can we get more information on the new assets?

[27-Jun-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Managed to get RFOX on my node, but all I did was add the entire line to the start of my startassets file. because my `coinlist` file does not provision for more than name and supply. Need to think about this some more and have holidays for a week starting tomrrow so, for now just need to get it on node and working.

[27-Jun-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also VRSC has said they released a version that can run on CPU's without special instructions, but it still crashes on my Notary Node.

[27-Jun-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I simply cannot add it, unless they use deckers fix with software instruction emulation, that I cannot seem to find anywhere, I will need tp host my VRSC chain in a cloud instance at my DC and RPC to it via an SSH tunnel. Not sure If I will have time to set all this up before I leave on Friday but I can try to if no other fix is found.

[27-Jun-18 03:50 AM] Mylo#8306
what are RFOX params to start komodod from command ilne?

[27-Jun-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=RFOX -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146

[27-Jun-18 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
I'm connected to that node

[27-Jun-18 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have RFOX working, and it has funds... however with block reward I already mined a heap.

[27-Jun-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol.. we need a better way for starting al these new params...

[27-Jun-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that works mylo, but with as many params as verus... its going to be mighty messy

[27-Jun-18 04:11 AM] Mylo#8306
oh ok - thought it was too simple a request for this bunch of NNs to not complete lol

you can then email yourself if you're on a fork.

[27-Jun-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its only needed for starting them, and then `coinlist` can just be the names only for all other operations.

[27-Jun-18 04:47 AM] Mylo#8306

Would anyone be in favour of having some kind of standardised JSON file in the Komodo repo of all asset chains with args NNs should be running. Something like:

```js
[
  {
    "ac_name": "ZILLA",
    "ac_supply": "11000000",
    "addnode": "54.39.23.248"
  },
  {
    "ac_name": "RFOX",
    "ac_supply": "1000000000",
    "ac_reward": "100000000",
    "addnode": "78.47.196.146"
  }
  ...
]
```

The idea being that the main repo doesn't provide an init script, but just the required meta data. All NNs are free to build their own init scripts that loop over the provided array without having to hardcode asset chain params and try and keep them in sync with the komodo repo.

[27-Jun-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am all for this... as are a heap of other people. @patchkez  has been pretty outspoken about this in the past.  I am using my own scripts for the most part, and its getting hard to manage them now. Soe kind of standard is def the way to go.

[27-Jun-18 05:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
It would make it so much easier going forward

[27-Jun-18 05:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
everyone can have their own scripts, and James just needs to update a single  file and know all NNs will use that

[27-Jun-18 05:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can make a PR for this

[27-Jun-18 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think dragon riders are using python, and for the bash guys, I have no issue rewriting my scripts using jq... as I was a total noob at all this when I made my first ones I could do a much better job now.

[27-Jun-18 05:42 AM] patchkez#5349
@lukechilds yes we need something like this! One central configuration file for whole NN. Config should have also information if chain has to be notarized or just started, rpc and p2p ports. This config should be then used by all other scripts (m_notary_run, assetchains). Config file should have also addnotary IPs, The thing is that some of these data already exists in coins/ folder in Supernet repo.

[27-Jun-18 05:45 AM] patchkez#5349
then next to this central config file, operators could have another json config e.g. with just his changes e.g. pubkey, walletpassphrase, or he could overide values which are defined in central config file

[27-Jun-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I over ride quite a few values in the standard bash init scripts...

[27-Jun-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I forked supernet and use git to merge updates as a work around atm.. something liek this would be great

[27-Jun-18 05:59 AM] NNoperator#3835

[27-Jun-18 06:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
JSON is parsable with `jq`, but it's quite complex

[27-Jun-18 06:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
$ cat assetchains.json
[
  {
    "ac_name": "ZILLA",
    "ac_supply": "11000000",
    "addnode": "54.39.23.248"
  },
  {
    "ac_name": "RFOX",
    "ac_supply": "1000000000",
    "ac_reward": "100000000",
    "addnode": "78.47.196.146"
  }
]

$ cat assetchains.json | jq '.[] | to_entries | map("-\(.key)=\(.value|tostring)") | reduce .[1:][] as $i ("\(.[0])"; . + " \($i)")'
"-ac_name=ZILLA -ac_supply=11000000 -addnode=54.39.23.248"
"-ac_name=RFOX -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146"
```

[27-Jun-18 06:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
I like the idea of having JSON as it's more powerful but maybe it's not the best format for this

[27-Jun-18 06:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
it might be better to just list the args

[27-Jun-18 06:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
e.g something like:
```
$ cat assetchainparams.txt
-ac_name=ZILLA -ac_supply=11000000 -addnode=54.39.23.248
-ac_name=RFOX -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146
```

[27-Jun-18 06:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
super easy to loop over in bash

[27-Jun-18 06:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
and for more powerful usage you can manually parse the params

[27-Jun-18 06:05 AM] patchkez#5349
@lukechilds I like first option more. If i want to use data like ac_supply, addnode IP, ... in other script, I have to parse it again

[27-Jun-18 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am happy to use python instead of bash if thats easier. Only used bash at first as everything was already in it

[27-Jun-18 06:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[27-Jun-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
JSON standard is better for moving foward I think

[27-Jun-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with hundreds of chains n shit bash just wot be viable

[27-Jun-18 06:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
and on second thought, the args shouldn't be object properties but an array of objects

[27-Jun-18 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> can have json and a utility script to create the assetchainsparams.txt or vice versa.

[27-Jun-18 06:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
because you can't have duplicate object property names in JSON, but we might want duplicate CLI args

[27-Jun-18 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
merging something like Lazynode by @Deleted User with a standard JSON would be the best way, only thing is manyally adding new coins then.

[27-Jun-18 06:07 AM] patchkez#5349
yeah, I think all data should be in json or yaml format. The problem is that these formats is PITA to parse in bash

[27-Jun-18 06:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
Already done ‚òù

[27-Jun-18 06:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not sure about the arguments actually, how would you add multiple nodes:

`-addnode=78.47.196.146 -addnode=78.47.196.146`

or

`-addnode=78.47.196.146,78.47.196.146`

[27-Jun-18 06:09 AM] patchkez#5349
@lukechilds I think the first one is correct

[27-Jun-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first one

[27-Jun-18 06:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
in that case it needs to be an array of objects

[27-Jun-18 06:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
not object properties

[27-Jun-18 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> i think the lowest common denominator is assetchainsparams.txt example above.  and then create a utility script to make your json out of that.
bash is always the first tool a sys admin uses

[27-Jun-18 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> easier to read, and if there's a typo, the utility script will error on producing json/yaml
