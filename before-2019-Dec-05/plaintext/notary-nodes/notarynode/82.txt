i'll try to get the guide polished in the coming days/weeks before the next season starts

[04-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Alright#0419
@Strob it's there because it's simpler

[04-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure walletpassphrase or encryptwallet are needed at all

[04-Apr-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
and, yes. if you get your way to be propagated to minnet `m_notary_run`, we will have to update guide.

[04-Apr-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
i.e.: using `passphrase.txt` file

[04-Apr-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
you may be right and we may not need the `walletpassphrase` or `encryptwallet` calls at all. @jl777c or @kolo can confirm

Finally forget what I said about my splitfund cron solution, it's not working! I also added cd to the script folder but when I try to run decker script in cron I get this error in cron log: 
```css
[2019-04-04 09:35:01] [1m[[0m[33mTXSCLCC[0m[1m][0m [31mError: utxo count is not a number, may be daemon dead ... [0m
```
Any idea what this might be?
The script run perfectly when executed in the terminal...

[04-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
`PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin`

[04-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
put that above it in crontab

[04-Apr-19 01:46 PM] Strob#3417
same result ....😢

[04-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
yea sorry, wasn't sure it was going to work

[04-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
needed that to run some py scripts from cron, thought it might help

[04-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
Do you really use cron for your fund spliting or you use another job scheduling daemon?

[04-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
all cron

[04-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
I can't believe a job running fine in the terminal would not run in cron...

[04-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
ok

[04-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Strob#3417
I was thinking to try jobber

[04-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
my cron is literally just tweaked utxosplitter from LABS every 10 minutes then cleanwallettransactions twice a day on all the daemons

[04-Apr-19 01:51 PM] Strob#3417
exactly what I am aiming for.

[04-Apr-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Strob is your script that doesn't cron calling anything else (like another script or json)?

[04-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Strob#3417
I just commented some line in that script

[04-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Strob#3417
When I run it in the terminal I get this for example which is perfect:

[04-Apr-19 01:56 PM] zatJUM#9924
I use cron and it works fine with this entry:```cd /home/me/scripts/ && ./utxosplitter.sh >> /home/me/utxo_split.log 2>&1```

[04-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Strob#3417

anyone knows what is the condition for a transaction to be clean by `cleanwallettransactions` ?, because sometimes I noticed that calling `cleanwallettransactions` doesn't remove any tx
