@newvulcan plz do 😃

[22-Apr-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's good practice for the real season

[22-Apr-19 12:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
in that respect can we add HUSH as a new coin? 🤔

[22-Apr-19 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we can if 7 people agree 😛

[22-Apr-19 12:16 PM] newvulcan#4719
I'd give it a go

[22-Apr-19 12:16 PM] newvulcan#4719
I was going to try HUSH and PIRATE

[22-Apr-19 12:17 PM] newvulcan#4719
I assume we would need a larger KMD UTXO balance maintained ?

[22-Apr-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the balance isn't the issue, the issue is minsigs > 1, so you can't do it alone

[22-Apr-19 12:18 PM] newvulcan#4719
Ok

[22-Apr-19 12:25 PM] newvulcan#4719
Its the new HUSH3 daemon we need for this isn't it.

[22-Apr-19 12:30 PM] SHossain#0007
you also need to change the iguana code to add new coin on testnet if it is not BEER, PIZZA or TXSCLxxx coin

[22-Apr-19 12:31 PM] SHossain#0007
the easiest way to do that would be to use HUSH3 repo and mimic the setup of HUSH3 using a name TXSCLHUSH

[22-Apr-19 12:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm in, but would need some time to prepare. And some TXSCLHUSH.

[22-Apr-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can notarize hush3 as long as we all have diff keys its daemon would just ignore the notarizitions

[22-Apr-19 12:42 PM] newvulcan#4719
@SHossain  Gotcha - I'll have a go working on that this afternoon, be a good exercise for me, as I've never done it before.

[22-Apr-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You don't need to change iguana code to notarize any assetchain

[22-Apr-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just add coin

[22-Apr-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
However that sad the daemon won't accept our notarixations as valid unless its called txscl or pizza

Definitely

[22-Apr-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its good practice I guess... But is not hush being merged to kmd anyway

[22-Apr-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it has to be hush3 repo

[22-Apr-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We should pick some random shit coin and just start notarizingnit

[22-Apr-19 12:46 PM] newvulcan#4719
I thought it had, didn't it pass it's magic block number last week ?

[22-Apr-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181

He's merging it to kmd what's the point of this?

[22-Apr-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. no point. idea discarded

[22-Apr-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Do another coin that's not kmd based

[22-Apr-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Better practice

[22-Apr-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not my call, u can do hush if u guys want....

[22-Apr-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just saying sticking with kmd based coins isn't that much erxta to learn

[22-Apr-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
3rd party shit coin is going to waste time if we are not continuing with that

[22-Apr-19 12:49 PM] newvulcan#4719
Its a fair point, I didn't appreciate that.

[22-Apr-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
almost all coins are same anyway

[22-Apr-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
source and setup is just different

[22-Apr-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, dpow is exactly the same for all coins, but setup of daemon etc is diffrent

[22-Apr-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
> setup of daemon etc is diffrent
imo, anyone can try compile a different coin in their own Linux box. indeed that helps to learn. but, integrating a new 3rd party coin on testnet is just waste of time if that coin is not being ended up in mainnet

[22-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really... Labs notarized over 100 discarded chains in it life I think

[22-Apr-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All served much testing purposes

[22-Apr-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we should make cluster?

[22-Apr-19 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
were those 3rd party coin?

[22-Apr-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No all assetchains

[22-Apr-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Labs can't do 3rd party which is why I suggested 3rd party non kmd coin because most ppl here have not done that yet

[22-Apr-19 12:54 PM] SHossain#0007
it is easy to integrate AC. less easy to integrate 3rd party

[22-Apr-19 12:54 PM] newvulcan#4719
I'll defer to those with more experience - last thing I want to risk is wasting anyones time with something that probably won't be of benefit - after all we've got enough to do with what we have. I might take a look anyway, give me a chance to wade through the code and try to understand a bit more about it.

[22-Apr-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can notarize any coin BTC based, as long as it cheap so we can buy a few coins

[22-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will make the coins file for iguana, easy stuff

[22-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hard part is generating the address from the pub key but I'm sure @Alright  can do that

[22-Apr-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With his python lib

[22-Apr-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Daemon will ignore the tx made, but so does beer and we are notarizing that

[22-Apr-19 01:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
omg, what have i done 🙈

[22-Apr-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Find a btc based shit coin that's really cheap

[22-Apr-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can notarize thay

@blackjok3r For generating address from pubkey you can just use this http://gobittest.appspot.com/Address . Also, it's a good and clean example how to generate addresses from pubkey. Difference for various coins will be only on step "4 - Adding network bytes to 3". If you will add `00` as network byte, you will get BTC address, if you will add `3C` - you will get KMD address ... 
p.s. 2All: Don't enter privkeys in a web-forms (!), any online tools can be safely used only for pub -> address, not for priv -> something. Privkey should be kept in secret.

Hush 3/is exacly the same as kmd apart from a few lines for the emission curve...

@blackjok3r may be good idea to try to use old HUSH v2 as a test?

@blackjok3r don't sure ... but setupping a pool for getting blocks can be part of this test too )

what is the difference between a new chain created with different name apart from the value?

[22-Apr-19 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
any chain you create using KMD daemon  is real chain

[22-Apr-19 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
there is nothing fake about that

BEER is being used as a test chain. but the chain is real

But I still think external coin is best for learning
