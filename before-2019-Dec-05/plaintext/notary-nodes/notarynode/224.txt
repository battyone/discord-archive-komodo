oh, with a new tx

[12-Oct-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
ok. i thought you meant on the HUSH chain

[12-Oct-19 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's somewhat interesting, i guess nobody has made another similar xtn

[12-Oct-19 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
because you would assume to see various nodes complain about various heights, but most nodes all coredump on that same block height. and I guess we haven't seen another of those xtns, yet

[12-Oct-19 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
no doubt some fanbois of Hush are preparing to make some more now

[12-Oct-19 05:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
all notaries were just lucky, it wasn't that they were not running the code that could coredump. very interesting bug

[12-Oct-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
all the NN nodes were up, so they accepted the block

[12-Oct-19 05:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, you are saying only nodes that were not present on the network when it was in the mempool coredumped

[12-Oct-19 05:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
now i understand

[12-Oct-19 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
nodes which had to sync, those are the ones that coredump. This is a very interesting bug, of who it selects

[12-Oct-19 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
this explains why GUI wallet users were singled out most

[21-Oct-19 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am looking for the NN's which run these IPs:

[21-Oct-19 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
SEEDNODE2=136.243.227.142
SEEDNODE3=5.9.224.250

[21-Oct-19 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright @blackjok3r are these yours? I vaguely remember maybe getting them from you, I think they are NN ip's

[21-Oct-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
none of those are mine.

[21-Oct-19 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
danke

[21-Oct-19 05:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH seems to be experiencing an overloaded p2p network, trying to debug stuff. 2 of our 3 seednodes are down

[21-Oct-19 05:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
so most HUSH nodes are not able to rejoin the network and start syncing, because they look for enough valid peers indefinitely, it seems

[22-Oct-19 11:30 AM] eclips#1570
updated hush then resetted datadir, do you have a valide peer ? i can't dl the blockchain right now

[22-Oct-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@eclips this is related to all Hush DNS seeds being down

[22-Oct-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo I don't think seeds.komodoplatform.com returns valid HUSH seeds

[22-Oct-19 12:45 PM] kolo#1111
It returns notary nodes

[22-Oct-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo i guess a lot of notaries are not doing their job and running HUSH nodes, then

[22-Oct-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
DNS Seed stuff does not work correctly

[22-Oct-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
185:        vSeeds.push_back(CDNSSeedData("komodoplatform.com", "seeds.komodoplatform.com")); // @kolo - old static dns seeds
186:        vSeeds.push_back(CDNSSeedData("kolo.supernet.org", "static.kolo.supernet.org")); // @kolo - new static dns seeds ToDo

```

[22-Oct-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
is it assumed that smart chains can use KMD dns seeds?

[22-Oct-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
because that was the assumption

[22-Oct-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
but Hush has no functional DNS seeds that I can see

[22-Oct-19 12:47 PM] kolo#1111
Nope, I never assumed smart chains to use same seed names

[22-Oct-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, our normal nodes are overloaded, so many people are having issues bringing a node into sync

[22-Oct-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo well, it's assumed, since it's not able to be changed via CLI options, and it's hardcoded

[22-Oct-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
so these seeds are for KMD only?

[22-Oct-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
that does not seem to be documented anywhere, and I expect would surprise many smart chains

[22-Oct-19 12:48 PM] kolo#1111
For many assets. They make no harm and you can add your own seeds via addnode or own dns host

[22-Oct-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am happy to pay some NNs to run a DNS seed for Hush, that is how much I dislike running DNS seeds. So if somebody wants money, DM me

[22-Oct-19 12:49 PM] kolo#1111
dm me IP of your alive node and I will add it there

[22-Oct-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
I used to run a DNS seed for the old hush network

[22-Oct-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo you don't understand

[22-Oct-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
my only nodes are overloaded and nobody can join hush network

[22-Oct-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
feels like I am talking in circles

[22-Oct-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
Where can I see how many NNs are notarizing Hush?

[22-Oct-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I do not think many NNs are doing their job

[22-Oct-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
where are the stats sites now?

[22-Oct-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326

[22-Oct-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
wow

[22-Oct-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
Many NNs are not notarizing HUSH

[22-Oct-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
i see about 25% of the NN network is not notarizing HUSH

[22-Oct-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c is this considered normal?

This is HUSH dPoW chart. Most of the notary nodes are notarizing HUSH.
`I do not think many NNs are doing their job`
Somewhat untrue. Some of them are not notarizing. Those includes 2 dwy nodes, 2 dev nodes and few other nodes where the node might have crashed or other issues.

[22-Oct-19 01:10 PM] SHossain#0007
This chart shows quite well distributed notarization among the nodes.

[22-Oct-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there's also a couple/few that don't show in that 8 hr window that are in fact notarizing it, just not all that often

[22-Oct-19 01:17 PM] SHossain#0007
yep

[22-Oct-19 01:17 PM] SHossain#0007
and dwy nodes doesn't notarize anything

[22-Oct-19 01:18 PM] SHossain#0007
@dukeleto how many peers your overloaded seed nodes have?

[22-Oct-19 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain ok, i see 13% of the network not notarizing a 3rd party coin, and that doesn't seem great

[22-Oct-19 02:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
since DNS seeds can only return a max of 11 IP's in a DNS packet, this gives a good chance of all DNS seeds being useless for a given coin

[22-Oct-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
(11/64)*(1 - 13%) = 11/64*(.87) = .149 = 15% chance all DNS seeds returned are not valid

[22-Oct-19 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain i could probably increase peer count, that would help

[22-Oct-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain 14 peers

[22-Oct-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
14 peers on your overloaded seed nodes?

[22-Oct-19 02:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
The problem is that mining pools and nobody can get into sync currently, and I am debugging it. Many things are involved. DNS seeds being fucked up are a big part of it.

[22-Oct-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wrote u code already to specify different DNS...

[22-Oct-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Nobody tested it

[22-Oct-19 02:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am hearing problems from all over the place, and debugging it. p2p network seems fucked

[22-Oct-19 02:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i have no idea what you speak of, is it merged to komodo.git and documented?

[22-Oct-19 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No it was for u... Months ago

[22-Oct-19 02:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
no memory of that, maybe it was a dream

[22-Oct-19 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

[22-Oct-19 02:28 PM] SHossain#0007
16 peers are default for all AC. how come 14 peers are overloading them? 
my NNs has 54 and 76 for hush. maybe those are tooooo much overloading for my nodes.

[22-Oct-19 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think git has the answer

[22-Oct-19 02:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain the problem is p2p clients not working. my node does not exhibit problems, but the entire rest of the network cannot connect. Perhaps I am wrong about "overloaded". But something is egregiously wrong

[22-Oct-19 02:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r setting custom dns seeds, maybe you wrote that code somewhere

[22-Oct-19 02:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
did it ever get merged?

[22-Oct-19 02:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, Hush will be running our own DNS seeds, because the current KMD dns seeds are essentially broken for 3rd party coins

@blackjok3r have you seen the latest BTC core stuff like this?

[22-Oct-19 02:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's metadata leakage to deterministically connect to the same DNS servers every time

[22-Oct-19 02:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
so the latest BTC core does it non-deterministically

[22-Oct-19 02:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
i may add this to the code

[22-Oct-19 02:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it samples 3 of 10 DNS seeds

[22-Oct-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That metadata üòÇ

[22-Oct-19 02:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
and each new node cannot be spied on if 1 DNS seed is compromised

[22-Oct-19 02:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is pretty important, so yeah
