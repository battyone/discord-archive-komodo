[16-Nov-19 09:50 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe some early miner can sell you at that price

It's a rap song and it popped into my head when this chan became active

[16-Nov-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007

[16-Nov-19 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007

[16-Nov-19 09:57 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
Only need some 🍀

Is there an blur discord? And the newest GUI wallet doesn’t work for me on win10

[19-Nov-19 05:12 PM] Biz#0842
@vogelfreund88 sorry, just seeing this! Discord is here: https://discord.gg/ft46QmK and wasn’t aware of the win10 issue - will look into

[19-Nov-19 11:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz fyi, i don't think there is a link to discord on the blur website. not sure if that is intentional

[20-Nov-19 03:52 AM] Biz#0842
Really? I thought there was one in social media. Hmm

[20-Nov-19 03:52 AM] Biz#0842
There is! Just only a logo. Some text labeling would help

[20-Nov-19 03:53 AM] Biz#0842
One of those UX things where I forget others aren’t as familiar

[20-Nov-19 03:53 AM] Biz#0842
Noted, and we’ll add something to make it more clear

[20-Nov-19 07:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
groovy, i had trouble finding it with my old person eyes 😉

[20-Nov-19 07:40 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
Wtb blur with kmd dm me offers.

Nice, up to 1700 sats, nethash starting to be persistently above 3.5 and even tagging over 4.2mh. 😄

[22-Nov-19 03:19 PM] bishop#9773
Not even a million dollar market cap yet. I'll speculate somewhere around BBR/AEON market caps inside 3-6 months.
