mac building is a pain in the ass. have never succeeded myself

[17-Jul-19 08:01 AM] jorian#4555
@ca333 knows a thing or 2 about this, as well as @dukeleto maybe

[17-Jul-19 08:02 AM] jorian#4555
```checking whether the C compiler works... no``` should be a hint though

mingw-w**64**?

[17-Jul-19 08:31 AM] ca333#0118
ok give me a moment - finishing a compilation run right now and will check right afterwards. I suspect a suboptimal compiler setup.

`mingw-w64?` yes thats fine

Hi, quick question.. i had a SOLO pool setup for mining komodo ... and obviously on July 15th it stopped working... 

i have since updated my komodo daemon and have re-synced the entire chain... and its all up to date cause i can see this clearly when i do getnetworkinfo and getinfo commands...

however my getblocktemplate command fails and says  Cannot get a block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!

this same code was working before the node update...

any help would be very appreciated, thank you

[18-Jul-19 04:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
@g00dnatur3 you can get that error temporarily, as a new block comes in. Your node must be fully in sync to call that RPC. So my suggestion is to have your code try a few times

[18-Jul-19 01:04 PM] Mylo#8306
@dukeleto  gotta ask for your git foo on getting number of contributors to  a particular repo - or dbl check at least what github has.
i have a discrepancy between the github contributor count vs what comes up in `git log -s -n | wc -l` or `git log -s -n --no-merges | wc -l`
these outputs are `547` & `542` respectively on jl777/komodo (branch master)

But github lists 424 contributors to the project.

Any ideas how gh comes up with this figure?

[18-Jul-19 01:16 PM] Mylo#8306
This i found a reason:
```
If the email address you used to author the commits has not been added to your GitHub account, your commits won't be linked to your account, and you won't appear in the contributors graph. 
```

[18-Jul-19 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo yes, github merges multiple emails into Github users/contributors, if it can

[18-Jul-19 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
those stats will never line up perfectly

[18-Jul-19 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, try `git shortlog -se`

[18-Jul-19 04:06 PM] Mylo#8306
yep, `git shortlog -s -n` is a good one

[18-Jul-19 04:06 PM] Mylo#8306
haven't used `e`, will try it next iteration

[18-Jul-19 04:06 PM] Mylo#8306

thanks, i won't die wondering now!!   won't need email, cheers

[18-Jul-19 04:24 PM] Alright#0419
@g00dnatur3 are you getting that every single time you call getblocktemplate?

[18-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Alright#0419
if so, do you have peers? You can check `getpeerinfo`

[18-Jul-19 05:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo email helps batch/differentiate different contributors

[18-Jul-19 05:47 PM] Mylo#8306
ok i'll run some tests

[18-Jul-19 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo what is your end goal?

@blackjok3r

[19-Jul-19 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo at fancy companies, you can have 456 commits that say `fuck` as the commit message, but when you submit to the "official" company repo, usually it's rebased into 1 commit with a meaningful message. And I have worked at places that *forbade* any type of code comments

[19-Jul-19 04:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
so for blackjoker, it would mean doing a `git squash` before sending a PR, to keep history "pretty"

[19-Jul-19 04:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
There are 2 very very very different camps of Git Users: Historians and Story-Tellers

Are you a Historian or a Story-Teller?

[19-Jul-19 04:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
Historians want every single shitty commit from history, no data must be lost!!!! Story-Tellers want a nice story to be told with commits

[19-Jul-19 04:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's like emacs vs vi

[19-Jul-19 04:34 PM] Oszy#5734
guys, is the KMD tipbot open source?

[19-Jul-19 04:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo i meant rebased/squashed above, both/either can be used to clean up history

[19-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Mylo#8306
not sure sorry.  the maintainer of the bot is on this discord. the pirate discord will know @Oszy

[19-Jul-19 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
jl777 is a Historian

[19-Jul-19 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
All history is good history

[19-Jul-19 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
Zcash Core are Story-Tellers

[19-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Mylo#8306
@dukeleto  i like reading storys.   but i commit like a historian myself.   the stories belong in the tickets imo

[19-Jul-19 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is a fundamental reason why KMD and ZEC source code are so divergent

[19-Jul-19 04:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
as well as KMD world being less into test fetishism

[19-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Mylo#8306
it's up to the committer to rebase/squash?  or can any old sod do it?

[19-Jul-19 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Story-Tellers` use append?

[19-Jul-19 04:38 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks - i use append with a one liner....now i understand.

[19-Jul-19 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo git has no idea of permissions/authentication. Any git repo can perform those commands

[19-Jul-19 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
One feature of `git rebase` is squashing

[19-Jul-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I append everything that "goes together" during a single session

[19-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto what the logic behind this?
And I have worked at places that forbade any type of code comments

[19-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Alright#0419
just to emphasis importance of git?

[20-Jul-19 05:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
Their logic was that code should be "intention-revealing" and if you need to write a comment, you should name your variables and functions better. Additionally, since tests were required, those were kind of the "contract" or "code documentation" for how the code was expected to work

[20-Jul-19 05:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
It's an extreme position

[20-Jul-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most of my commits were from LABS/Staked before I knew what I was doing.

the superiority of the historical commit is proven simply by the ability to binary search the set of commits to isolate what change introduced a bug. a single squashed commit loses all that and makes it nearly impossible to find out what change introduced a bug

[21-Jul-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
this is not a style issue, but more a better way to debug

[21-Jul-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if you know the bug was introduced with some specific 10 line change, that is orders of magnitude easier than finding out it is buried some where in thousands of commits with tens of thousands of lines
