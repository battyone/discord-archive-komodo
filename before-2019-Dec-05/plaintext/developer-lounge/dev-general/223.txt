everything is open source here, if you want something with blockchains, you can make it here

[19-Sep-19 06:42 PM] xeonrider#3120
its more like getting a reward for playing

[19-Sep-19 06:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Regards wallets: https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama Verus Agama is on JS, might be interesting for you since you JS coder

so lets say my player wants to buy cards

[19-Sep-19 06:43 PM] xeonrider#3120
and these cards are NFT, so they should stacked somewhere right?

[19-Sep-19 06:43 PM] xeonrider#3120
and that same wallet should have like the balance of the coin I made

[19-Sep-19 06:44 PM] xeonrider#3120
like the btc webwallets or the ones from ethereum

[19-Sep-19 06:44 PM] TonyL#3577
start step by step, read docs, spin a chain, make transactions, try existing CCs

[19-Sep-19 06:44 PM] TonyL#3577
and then I think puzzle will collect in your mind on some point

[19-Sep-19 06:44 PM] xeonrider#3120
i am doing step by step, and by making a plan

[19-Sep-19 06:44 PM] xeonrider#3120
that jl guy said I only needed assets antara

[19-Sep-19 06:45 PM] TonyL#3577
now you're planning like a step 10, it's better to start from step 0 üôÇ

[19-Sep-19 06:45 PM] xeonrider#3120
so no need to develop a custom one

[19-Sep-19 06:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
that jl guy is pretty cool

I dont know just arrived here and is mostly about telling me to read the docs. I don't mind text, but thats a lot of text.

[19-Sep-19 06:45 PM] jorian#4555
you don't have to dev a new one no, you can look at how rogue was made for example

[19-Sep-19 06:45 PM] xeonrider#3120
There are no videos.

[19-Sep-19 06:46 PM] xeonrider#3120
that's a bit over my head for now, sorry.

[19-Sep-19 06:46 PM] jorian#4555
so how would you like it to be? honest question

[19-Sep-19 06:46 PM] xeonrider#3120
I am just thinking what to learn, and the wallet part is just a question mark

[19-Sep-19 06:46 PM] xeonrider#3120
@jorian like cryptozombies but that will never happen

[19-Sep-19 06:47 PM] jorian#4555
well, a wallet is an interface to the state of the blockchain, it merely displays the balances of the private keys you own.

[19-Sep-19 06:47 PM] jorian#4555
roughly speaking

[19-Sep-19 06:48 PM] jorian#4555
cryptozombies looks nice

[19-Sep-19 06:48 PM] jorian#4555
doesn't exist here though, sorry

[19-Sep-19 06:49 PM] xeonrider#3120
looking at the some examples I think developers here are from another galaxy. So I don't expect something for newbies.

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
@jorian sure, but I mean even if it was just a discord bot handling everything

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
hold on

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
is the bot here open source?

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
it made me a wallet

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] jorian#4555
bot? @TonyL help me out

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] jorian#4555
i missed that development

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
yes, the komodo bot

[19-Sep-19 06:50 PM] jorian#4555
i think it was implemented last week

[19-Sep-19 06:51 PM] jorian#4555
you mean the tipbot?

[19-Sep-19 06:51 PM] xeonrider#3120
!kmdtip balance

[19-Sep-19 06:51 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure what bot we're talking about üôÇ

TipBot
Please use #tip-bot to talk to TipBot.

[19-Sep-19 06:51 PM] jorian#4555
ah tipbot

[19-Sep-19 06:51 PM] xeonrider#3120
that one ^^

[19-Sep-19 06:51 PM] jorian#4555
not sure, there are some open source versions but i think this one was made by @sclear

[19-Sep-19 06:52 PM] xeonrider#3120
oh

[19-Sep-19 06:52 PM] jorian#4555
although that is something completely different

[19-Sep-19 06:52 PM] jorian#4555
that bot only keeps track of users and its balances in its own database i think, there's no Antara going on in there

[19-Sep-19 07:02 PM] jorian#4555
@xeonrider to stay with the cryptozombies, if i see that correctly, you program your own smart contract / dapp on an Ethereum sidechain. With komodo, you basically spawn your own independent blockchain (a new Ethereum if you like) after which you can start using assets as tokens, similar to ERC20 and ERC721

[19-Sep-19 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
it is similar, but at the same time you can't really compare ethereum and komodo

[19-Sep-19 07:04 PM] xeonrider#3120
I am using it as a reference.

[19-Sep-19 07:05 PM] xeonrider#3120
I just want to understand how to create a wallet.

[19-Sep-19 07:05 PM] xeonrider#3120
In the libraries from Ethereum, like web3, you just create one with Account.*

[19-Sep-19 07:05 PM] xeonrider#3120
I don't know the Komodo stuff, and so far my QA is getting me to places I want to be.

[19-Sep-19 07:09 PM] jorian#4555
it's been a long time ago since i last studied eth and its accounts, but as far as i can remember, komodo is utxo based, where eth is accounts based

[19-Sep-19 07:09 PM] jorian#4555
so again, not really comparable

[19-Sep-19 07:13 PM] xeonrider#3120
I mean, isn't there a similar way to make wallets, or library or something. I mean the verus chamleon wallets started somewhere too, right?

[19-Sep-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv has an html wallet

[19-Sep-19 07:14 PM] xeonrider#3120
libnspv?

[19-Sep-19 07:14 PM] xeonrider#3120
do you have a link?

[19-Sep-19 07:14 PM] xeonrider#3120
someone should do a video about all these things

[19-Sep-19 07:15 PM] jorian#4555
verus wallet is a JS electron wallet, that either uses a native coin daemon or talks to a SPV, like electrum or nSPV

[19-Sep-19 07:16 PM] jorian#4555
a video doing what?

[19-Sep-19 07:22 PM] xeonrider#3120
Just to follow along and get background information at the same time.

[19-Sep-19 07:23 PM] xeonrider#3120
so, Komodo doesn't have its own wallet?

[19-Sep-19 07:24 PM] xeonrider#3120
Verus has its own blockchain too, is it different from Komodo?

[19-Sep-19 07:35 PM] jorian#4555
i guess you can say that yes, komodo had its own wallet but it got hacked a while ago, so the advice was to use on of the wallets that ecosystem businesses created, such as Verus, Chameleon etc.

[19-Sep-19 07:35 PM] xeonrider#3120
oh

[19-Sep-19 07:35 PM] xeonrider#3120
so it isn't secure

[19-Sep-19 07:35 PM] xeonrider#3120
ok, gotcha

[19-Sep-19 07:35 PM] jorian#4555
now you're jumping to conclusions

[19-Sep-19 07:35 PM] jorian#4555
the wallet had a node.js vulnerability

[19-Sep-19 07:36 PM] jorian#4555
and only the Agama wallet maintained by Komodo devs

[19-Sep-19 07:36 PM] jorian#4555
the other wallets didn't have the issue

[19-Sep-19 07:44 PM] xeonrider#3120
but if it was a vulnerability, wasn't it never patched?

[19-Sep-19 07:47 PM] jorian#4555
i'm not on the komodo team, i can't speak to why it wasn't patched

[19-Sep-19 07:48 PM] jorian#4555
the komodo devs had to act fast and used the vulnerability themselves to prevent the hacker from stealing a lot of funds

[19-Sep-19 07:48 PM] xeonrider#3120
üòê

[19-Sep-19 07:49 PM] xeonrider#3120
that qualifies as insecure to me

[19-Sep-19 07:49 PM] jorian#4555
what is insecure in your eyes?

[19-Sep-19 07:49 PM] xeonrider#3120
uhm a hacker being able to steal a lot of funds

[19-Sep-19 07:49 PM] jorian#4555
like what happened with the DAO

[19-Sep-19 07:49 PM] jorian#4555
or parity

[19-Sep-19 07:50 PM] jorian#4555
ETH is as insecure

[19-Sep-19 07:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
I apparently stepped on your toes.

[19-Sep-19 07:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
Not intended.

[19-Sep-19 07:50 PM] jorian#4555
no, i just countered your argument

[19-Sep-19 07:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
Right.

[19-Sep-19 07:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
I am wrong. Totally not insecure.

[19-Sep-19 07:50 PM] jorian#4555
like i said, Agama or VRSC wallet or any other wallet is probably built in JS, which uses the blockchains of the coins that are integrated in that wallet

[19-Sep-19 07:51 PM] xeonrider#3120
ok, so my alternatives are only 3rd parties for looking into my own wallet

[19-Sep-19 07:51 PM] jorian#4555
if that JS wallet has a vulnerability, it doesn't mean that komodo is ded because it's insecure

[19-Sep-19 07:51 PM] xeonrider#3120
or the libspv thing

[19-Sep-19 07:51 PM] jorian#4555
no

[19-Sep-19 07:51 PM] jorian#4555
you can build your own wallet perfectly fine

[19-Sep-19 07:52 PM] jorian#4555
and if you build komodo yourself, the `komodo-cli` is a wallet of some sorts, since you can create new addresses, send coins, etc

[19-Sep-19 07:52 PM] xeonrider#3120
the cli doesn't come with the binaries?

[19-Sep-19 07:52 PM] jorian#4555
they do

[19-Sep-19 07:53 PM] jorian#4555
there is komodod and there is komodo-cli

[19-Sep-19 07:53 PM] jorian#4555
komodo the daemon and komodo the command line interface

[19-Sep-19 07:54 PM] xeonrider#3120
alright, so how do I create my own wallet?

[19-Sep-19 07:55 PM] jorian#4555
you start the komodo blockchain, you use `komodo-cli getnewaddress` and ta-da, you have an address with 0 balance, in your wallet which is located at `~/.komodo/wallet.dat`
