put all gpus out there to good use again

[19-Oct-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the blocktimes would be quite variable though and might get stuck on occasion

[19-Oct-18 09:37 PM] Alice#9607
wouldnt matter too much, just choose the best model

[19-Oct-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but I solved a "getting stuck" issue in PoS64 staking, so i guess it wont matter as long as most of the time the model can be improved

[19-Oct-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
what if there is no better model?

[19-Oct-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
does it generate a new block?

[19-Oct-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
if it settles into a local minima, then it might get stuck there for a while

[19-Oct-18 09:38 PM] Alice#9607
I wouldnt tie the consensus to the learning process alone

[19-Oct-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it can just randomly get some close to the last block and go a bit backward to avoid getting stuck

[19-Oct-18 09:39 PM] Alice#9607
I want the blockchain to compensate the miners for their learning work

[19-Oct-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
presumably all models close to the local minima are ok

[19-Oct-18 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so why not? can base new blocks based on improved model, or after some time of no improvement a randomly selected one within close distance

[19-Oct-18 09:40 PM] Alice#9607
yes, exactness is not important for ai models. still convergence stops at some point

[19-Oct-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the big issue I had with this was how to change to a new problem set

[19-Oct-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe that is the trigger to change to the next problem set

[19-Oct-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so people submit problems to the blockchain to be solved, it is queued up and started when the previous one cant be improved upon for X period of time

[19-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Alice#9607
you can serialize the network architecture to json

[19-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Alice#9607
maybe one chain per neural network

[19-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Alice#9607
a single neural network is only a building block

[19-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Alice#9607
in reinforcement learning one iterates constantly on the same few networks, like alpha go

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Alice#9607
the blockchain constantly improves the ai

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Alice#9607
as it moves along

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
dynamically spawning a chain per neuralnetwork is a very interesting idea.

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it avoids the problem of a new training set

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the training set defines the chain

[19-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Alice#9607
exactly, thats one reason I am interested in komodo

[19-Oct-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
then the outputs of this chain makes the inputs for the next chain

[19-Oct-18 09:45 PM] Alice#9607
you could have an alpha go chain

[19-Oct-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
even if there are no new blocks as it found the solution, or it finds improvments slowly, wont matter

[19-Oct-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
overall, some neural net is being advanced and generating coins

[19-Oct-18 09:45 PM] Alice#9607
one can use transactions to interact with the neural network

[19-Oct-18 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
need i build an AI capable machine next? üòÉ

[19-Oct-18 09:46 PM] Alice#9607
yes, SHossain!

[19-Oct-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes CC based tx would be the way to make it very flexible

[19-Oct-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
make an AI cluster of chains, fungible coins and cross chain CC to link them together

[19-Oct-18 09:46 PM] Alice#9607
inference is cheap to compute

[19-Oct-18 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
well, this is very interesting to me and i would enjoy helping as I can

[19-Oct-18 09:47 PM] Alice#9607
yes great, maybe we do a private chat

[19-Oct-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[19-Oct-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but tomorrow, it is already long day

@Alice welcome to Komodo
Really nice to hear your idea üôÇ

how good my nvidia board will be. Don‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs model now. I have an nvidia arm64 board

[19-Oct-18 10:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It does good AI GPU work as I remember

[19-Oct-18 10:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@jl777c remember?

[19-Oct-18 10:39 PM] jl777c#5810
long ago, yes

[19-Oct-18 10:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I hope I can put it to good use with this AI project if it comes to life üôÇ

[19-Oct-18 10:46 PM] Alice#9607
Hi @grewalsatinder!

[19-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Alice#9607
AI algorithms are very scalable across a wide range of hardware

[19-Oct-18 10:48 PM] Alice#9607
It primarily depends on the neural network size, i.e. memory requirements

[19-Oct-18 10:49 PM] Alice#9607
different types of networks can use different types of hardware, gpus, asics

[19-Oct-18 10:54 PM] Alice#9607
One problem in AI today is that the compute power is extremely centralized at the big corps

[19-Oct-18 10:56 PM] Alice#9607
a blockchain approach can potentially make extreme levels of compute power easier accessible

i will probably abandon the idea of buying a RED camera and build an AI rig

[19-Oct-18 11:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Kmd must be 50

[19-Oct-18 11:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Then can buy 1

@Alice please tell us a layman‚Äôs term a usecase of your project

Artificial general intelligence
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and future studies. Artific...

[19-Oct-18 11:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes aware of that term

[19-Oct-18 11:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
For consensus you will have a different algorithm or CC will do what is required with existing PoW?

[19-Oct-18 11:10 PM] Alice#9607
I think a combination of proof of "intelligence", i.e. the neural network model is improved by the miner, and a pow consensus for the fee earned by the miner

[19-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Alice#9607
improving the neural network model will stagnate, so its not optimal for consensus alone

[19-Oct-18 11:12 PM] Alice#9607
the key is to reward the miner for improving the model and to keep the good models safe from tampering

[19-Oct-18 11:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So I guess just the CC will be sufficient to add proof of Intelligence

[19-Oct-18 11:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It adds extra consensus rules

[19-Oct-18 11:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That‚Äôs means a great head start for your project will less efforts at ground level to start with

[19-Oct-18 11:17 PM] Alice#9607
maybe one can think of it as a type of POS
