`-reindex`  ?

[28-Nov-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it will take a while

[28-Nov-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe test on a short chain first?

[28-Nov-18 04:39 PM] gcharang#6833
ok.

Hrmm seems that spot change version isn‚Äôt working. Must be somewhere else. Hrmm

[28-Nov-18 04:56 PM] gcharang#6833
It works with `-timestampindex=1` after reindexing the chain. I did it to a chain of height ~6500 . I am afraid how much time it will take for KMD lol

[28-Nov-18 05:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
If you need a KMD bootstrap with the indexes ping me

@jl777c 
I was doing `komodod -timestampindex=1 -reindex=1` (txindex=1 in `.conf` file)
daemon crashed at around reindexing ~ 101000 block

Don't know if this is important

[28-Nov-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
any crash is important!

[28-Nov-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
gdb backtrace plz

[28-Nov-18 05:33 PM] gcharang#6833
Can you tell me how to do it?

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
gdb -args ./komodod ....

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] gcharang#6833
`gdb komodod -timestampindex=1 -reindex=1` and wait for it to crash?

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
where ... is all the args

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
after it loads:

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
run

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
that will start it running

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
then after it crashes

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
backtrace

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
that will print the backtrace

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] gcharang#6833
OK.

[28-Nov-18 05:44 PM] SHossain#0007
@gcharang you need to start like this (use
```
gdb -args ./komodod  -timestampindex=1 -reindex=1
```

[28-Nov-18 05:45 PM] SHossain#0007
then, once ready, type `run` and hit enter

[28-Nov-18 05:45 PM] SHossain#0007
if the daemon crashes, type `backtrace` and get the output

[28-Nov-18 05:46 PM] gcharang#6833
Thanks. 
I had started reindexing again before JL asked for backtrace. Now i'm waiting for it to crash. After it does then I will start it with gdb

[28-Nov-18 05:52 PM] gcharang#6833
It has crossed that block height now. Hasn't crashed yet. (btw not running with gdb. will do it next time if it crashes again)

[28-Nov-18 06:07 PM] gcharang#6833
The crash might be related to doing `./komodo-cli getblockhashes` when timestampindex is not available. I have a vps running komodod I tried `getblockhashes` on it. It was fine for some time, but just now noticed that it has crashed. 
Will try to reproduce this with gdb enabled

[28-Nov-18 06:12 PM] SHossain#0007
which branch did you use?

[28-Nov-18 06:13 PM] SHossain#0007
sapling activated source or normal?

[28-Nov-18 06:14 PM] gcharang#6833
Normal. komodoplatform/komodo dev

[28-Nov-18 06:24 PM] gcharang#6833
Sorry disregard the talk about VPS. It might not be related.
But the crash on my laptop, I first described is reproduced:
1) Komodoplatform/komodo repo:dev branch
2) command:  `gdb -args ./komodod  -timestampindex=1 -reindex=1`
3) `komodo-cli getchaintips` crashes the daemon when reindexing is happening
backtrace: http://pad.supernet.org/p/backtrace @jl777c

[28-Nov-18 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
getchaintips crashes all the time for some reason

[28-Nov-18 06:25 PM] gcharang#6833
ahh so it might not be related to reindexing at all.

[28-Nov-18 06:53 PM] gcharang#6833

It was from komodod built by @blackjok3r 's StakedNotary repo.
In normal komodo I get the same as you

[28-Nov-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
likely uninitialized data in the stakednotaries, while having 64 as the numnotaries

[28-Nov-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
ie a bug in stakednotary

[28-Nov-18 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
why are you using stakedchain/komodo though?

[28-Nov-18 08:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is anyone around that can provide feedback on the gateways cc?

There is an rpc call, `gatewaysinfo`, for which I need more information.

http://localhost:8080/komodo-docs-vuepress/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-gateways.html#gatewaysinfo

Look in the returned values and you'll see four `===` signs.

Those are the values for which I need some explanations about what they are and what they do.

[28-Nov-18 10:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
"why are there ===='s in the output of `gatewaysinfo`?" is the TLDR, I think.

[28-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
I haven't made inital gateway flow, so @jl777c knows better. I have modified and finished gateways regarding withdrawal flow and multisig case. But at the moment I'm not familiar with taddr, prefix and prefix2 parameters.

[28-Nov-18 10:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, that is just a plain bug

[28-Nov-18 10:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus you could maybe have a bug in the software which renders your docs, or there is no data there, or something like that

[28-Nov-18 10:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is not output from komodo-cli or komodod

[28-Nov-18 10:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus are those ==='s in the output from komodo-cli directly?

[28-Nov-18 10:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no, those are markers I put in the docs so that I can easily find where I needed more info

[28-Nov-18 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok

[28-Nov-18 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
so they are your markers üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 10:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think those are the last four in the whole library

[28-Nov-18 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
```$ komodo-cli help gatewaysinfo
gatewaysinfo bindtxid
```

[28-Nov-18 10:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes, I could just leave them blank, if we deploy

[28-Nov-18 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
they don't come from komodo

[28-Nov-18 10:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
but I don't want them blank, because then I'll forget, and people will get confused

[28-Nov-18 10:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
could just make an issue, I guess, since they're the last four

[28-Nov-18 10:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c @TonyL 

I made an issue to track this missing information.

When you have time, please let me know what those properties are, thanks.

https://github.com/siddhartha-komodo/komodo-docs-vuepress/issues/6

I removed the `===` signs from the docs for now.

[29-Nov-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
good news! even though it doesnt exactly make sense. at least there is a workaround

[29-Nov-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright it could be someone is running a sapling activated variant of the same chain, tx version 4 is totally different

[29-Nov-18 07:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@jl777c  it means it still a bug

[29-Nov-18 07:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but there is one problem in here

[29-Nov-18 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have just checked the mining rewards going to 3 different addresses

[29-Nov-18 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like 2 of the addresses i have set  -pubkey of those addresses

[29-Nov-18 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but the one address pubkey i havent set

[29-Nov-18 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and mining reward is distributed to that address as well

[29-Nov-18 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when i checked the addressgroupings its showing up in there it is my address

[29-Nov-18 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but i didnt set the mining rewards to go on that address it happened automatically

[29-Nov-18 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have no idea why it happened

[29-Nov-18 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can you explain please

[29-Nov-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
are you sure it is the staking reward? without actual details, i cant give any detailed answer. to stake a block, the utxo for an address is needed and it will create a transaction with that utxo

[29-Nov-18 08:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its the staking reward

[29-Nov-18 08:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i am sure

[29-Nov-18 08:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
pretty sure

[29-Nov-18 08:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because wehave set it to 100 coins
