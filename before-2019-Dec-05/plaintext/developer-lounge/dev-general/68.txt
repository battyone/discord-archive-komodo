[27-Nov-18 01:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
they are generating :/

[27-Nov-18 01:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but i cant see it everytime my eyes on explorer

[27-Nov-18 01:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[27-Nov-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do you have jq installed on your PC?

[27-Nov-18 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
jq nope

[27-Nov-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/

[27-Nov-18 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i install it

[27-Nov-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, it will help

[27-Nov-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and then try `./komodo-cli -ac_name=YourCHAIN listunspent | jq '.|length'`

[27-Nov-18 01:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okay

[27-Nov-18 01:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and then ?

[27-Nov-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tell me the resulting number

[27-Nov-18 01:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i install it on the server right ?

[27-Nov-18 01:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
on both of the staking nodes?

[27-Nov-18 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just on 1 node that contains a staking address is good for now

[27-Nov-18 01:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 01:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
what is the purpose of it ?

[27-Nov-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=YourCHAIN listunspent | jq '.|length'`
=
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=YourCHAIN listunspent` <- get unspents from daemon 
` | ` <- use the result of that 👆🏽 in the next command 
`jq '.|length'` <- use jq to parse the JSON response and return the number of objects in the JSON

[27-Nov-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in short, it tells how many UTXOs you have

[27-Nov-18 01:47 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the chain has started to work  fine again

[27-Nov-18 01:47 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i guess because it didnt stop

[27-Nov-18 01:47 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no invalid blocks no nothing

[27-Nov-18 01:47 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i ran it without

[27-Nov-18 01:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
trying to do the list unspent

[27-Nov-18 01:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i ll let you know the outcome

[27-Nov-18 02:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
10151

[27-Nov-18 02:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
this is the number i got

[27-Nov-18 02:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[27-Nov-18 02:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
by running the above command

[27-Nov-18 02:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
again the blocks were stopped

[27-Nov-18 02:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😦

[27-Nov-18 02:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i  was about to go

[27-Nov-18 02:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r ?

[27-Nov-18 02:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
any suggesstions

[27-Nov-18 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
10k isn't "awful" if you have a decent CPU, so that's probably not the issue (at least)

[27-Nov-18 02:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i again restarted the daemon

[27-Nov-18 02:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont know whats the matter :/

[27-Nov-18 02:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the memory is clearing as well on the cron jobs

[27-Nov-18 02:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
seems it will stop after a while as wel

[27-Nov-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the memory is clearing as well on the cron jobs`
Not sure what you mean by that

[27-Nov-18 02:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
sorry  i mean the buffer cache

[27-Nov-18 02:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have set the cron jobs on the buffer cache

[27-Nov-18 02:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
to clear up after every 8 hours

[27-Nov-18 02:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
as it was the issue before as well

[27-Nov-18 02:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so we had to restart the server

[27-Nov-18 02:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:

[27-Nov-18 02:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
on first node it says ht.20463 error validating winning blocktime 1543327635 -> 1154646343.00000 eligible.1543328146 test prior

[27-Nov-18 02:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
tried the zap wallettxes as well

[27-Nov-18 02:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
not working at all \

[27-Nov-18 02:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it stops building blocks

[27-Nov-18 02:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
both nodes are on set generate true 0

[27-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They can take up to 384s on PoS

[27-Nov-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`winners.4` = you only have 4 UTXOs that *can* stake in the current cycle

[27-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are you sure you are waiting long enough

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also seems like some problem with them not being elegible ...

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
although they are

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i have waited for atleast half an hour on the first tie

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
time *

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
your daemon doesnt lock up when it stops?

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
nope it stops

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
normally

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cannot take longer than 384s ... if taking longer than that there is an issue.

[27-Nov-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my 1st thought is: try more than 2 wallets...

[27-Nov-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had a report of staking node locking up when sending a transaction fro someon just before.

[27-Nov-18 02:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now what is the best possible solution i am tired of doing the same thing in the day again and again

[27-Nov-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes same... I suggested also need more nodes... I was using 9 daemons for staking with 2000+ utxo, you are using 10k on single one.

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just load up some more daemons and stake

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so atleast i need 3 nodes ?

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mayeb 5 ?

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
more ?

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
5 staking nodes 😮

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what is the purpouse of this chain

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS deosnt seem liek a good solution if you are staking 100% of the coins

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will constantly break

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its on 100% POS

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so what shall i do

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
increase the nodes ?

[27-Nov-18 02:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
staking nodes

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
or split the addresses

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
further more

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
using POS splitter

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Generally you would use far more than 1 or 2 nodes for a blockchain 🤷

{Reactions}
👆🏽 

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
haha true

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
that

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have an ptionI made for something else, that limits a chain to single miner using PoW with just 1 CPU core ?

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is that what your truing to do make a private chain?

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
actually i guess that is the problem my server only got 1 CPU core

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
10k utxo on a single core is ulikely to work.

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh 😮

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that said, PoS is not multi threaded either

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😦

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so what is the best possible solution for that

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
should i buy another node

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean server

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
set up staking node 3

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and staking node 4 on another server
