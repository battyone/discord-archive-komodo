[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and then split the addresses

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
then carry on

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am really not sure what he issue is, my suggrestion is to spread the utxos overmore nodes and address so more are elegible, but it seems an issue tha I have not really seen before

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But that said we never tested with just 2 nodes.

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes we havent experienced that either

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so to remove variables, just add more nodes

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and see what happens

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
more staking nodes and then i split the addresses

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that should help.

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it will be like 256 addresses

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
am i right

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes kind of

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i just distribute the balance

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that will work

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
How I did mine was to put 8 address each with 20 utxos on each daemon, then use 8 daemons on an 8 thread VPS.

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but thats not exactly super easy to get working

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine them all to -pubkey

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its distributed to 2 addresses currently

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and they all go to the same addreess

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yeah i know that

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
each node can mine to the same pubkey

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai thats is fine

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but DO NOT import the private key for that address on every node.

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just on 1

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yup i havent imported private key yet

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cool that should help.

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
if it stops

[27-Nov-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My guess is to just use more deamons...

[27-Nov-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
being PoS a very small VPS will work fine.

[27-Nov-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1 CPU is all thats needed

[27-Nov-18 02:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i am using

[27-Nov-18 02:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
1core 40 gb ssd 4 gb ram

[27-Nov-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`actually i guess that is the problem my server only got 1 CPU core`
yes, that's why I said
`10k isn't "awful" if you have a decent CPU` 
1 core isn't "decent" by any modern standards

[27-Nov-18 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well the staker will only use 1 core ... that said the wallet can use another and so can other process... guessing its just locked it up... befor emaking 1 nodes can you just increase cpu core to 2 ?

[27-Nov-18 02:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the best way @blackjok3r  has suggested is to use POS splitter on 4 nodes

[27-Nov-18 02:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
2 i have already used

[27-Nov-18 02:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
well the staker will only use 1 core ... that said the wallet can use another and so can other process... guessing its just locked it up... befor emaking 1 nodes can you just increase cpu core to 2 ?
actually that is the best idea as well

[27-Nov-18 02:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i can upgrade

[27-Nov-18 02:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the  server instead of making nodes

[27-Nov-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2 cores is better, at least *everything* isn't throttled during the check loop then

[27-Nov-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just try it before splitting all the coins more and more.

[27-Nov-18 02:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes  i will try

[27-Nov-18 02:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i will upgrade the cpu to 2 cores

[27-Nov-18 02:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
on the server

[27-Nov-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
far easier ... the stakign loop will just lock the daemon up I think on 1 core with large aounts of utxos.

[27-Nov-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, I wouldn't try more than 2k UTXOs with 1-2 cores

[27-Nov-18 02:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ill just check

[27-Nov-18 02:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and let you know

[27-Nov-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not me either ... on 8 daemons with 8 thread of very old CPU I was sing 5k over all 8.

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] D.rabbani#9094
btw @blackko

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2k UTXOs is still 31 per seg

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] D.rabbani#9094
btw @blackjok3r  its s=again stuck in invalid block mined

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and at times saw all 8 cores maxed out for extended periods.

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] D.rabbani#9094
try again

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
invlaid block doesnt matter

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its normal

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but its like continuosuly saying that 😄

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you never mine a valid block 100% of the time

[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i wait

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
before the blocks were generating very fast 😃

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but now again it stuck on that invalid blokc mined loop

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they will... and liekly you have increaded diffculty very high

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
making it very ahrd to mine a block.

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so what to do with the difficulty  😮

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
less utxos

[27-Nov-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, you will see invalids from time to time
This is from my stdout on another test chain and it's pure PoW

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it happens

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but ti should fix itself over time

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would not worry about it too much

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
difficulty adjusts.

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
either less utxo ro more nodes

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
718 is the difficulty

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or more cpu

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or some combination of these

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
by disstributing hte coins to many ppl, this issue never happens btw. 😉

[27-Nov-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`718 is the difficulty`
that's likely part of the reason you only have 4 eligible on that cycle

[27-Nov-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one thing though....

its going on and on and on 😄

[27-Nov-18 02:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
on both the nodes

[27-Nov-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do not move all UTXOs of both wallets until you have let the moved UTXOs mature, otherwise everything will stop until they mature (no matter how you split them)

[27-Nov-18 02:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oki

[27-Nov-18 02:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i wont

[27-Nov-18 02:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but right now when i stop the daemon and

[27-Nov-18 02:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
run it again

[27-Nov-18 02:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it will continue 😄

[27-Nov-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in a 100% PoS, invalids can also come from valid blocks that are not valid because of time

[27-Nov-18 02:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oki

[27-Nov-18 02:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i need to wait

[27-Nov-18 02:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
for the process

[27-Nov-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
basically, PoS builds a block now and waits to see if it's still valid when it's allowed (by time) to be a valid block (it's a bit more complex than that, but trying to keep it simple)
