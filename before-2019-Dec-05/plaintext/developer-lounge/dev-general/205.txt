`ht.7603, ShieldedPayments=0, ShieldedTx=0, FullyShieldedTx=0, ntz=2` still some work to do, it detected 2 notarizations in this block

[21-Aug-19 12:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
I need to make it smarter

[21-Aug-19 12:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
I guess it is possible for 2 valid notarization xtns to be in the same block?

[21-Aug-19 12:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
my guess is my code is just wrong, it treats all vin=13/vout=2 xtns as ntz's, when it should filter more

[21-Aug-19 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes we do ?

[21-Aug-19 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getNotarzationsFromBlock

[21-Aug-19 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes.

[21-Aug-19 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can have millions of nota in a block

[21-Aug-19 01:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
what is the purpose of more than 1 ntz in a block, other than accident?

[21-Aug-19 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but only 1 og them is valid

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
And also, is it "last one in wins?"

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its becaus iguana is broken

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
i.e. latest timestamp wins?

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its supped to wait for confirms

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it does not

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and no im not fixing that part

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will just make billions of egdecases

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
my code wants to count "valid notarizations"

[21-Aug-19 01:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
not "things which might be notarizations but are edge cases"

[21-Aug-19 01:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
so I think I only want to count 1 per block , but whatevs. I need to check for OP_RETURN or NN pubkeys in the xtn

[21-Aug-19 01:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
i want to batch any stats that we might want into this PR, because stuff changes the disk format of CBlockIndex

[21-Aug-19 01:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181

What yo uneed to do is decode op_return

[21-Aug-19 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then extract the notarized ht

[21-Aug-19 01:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
and so adding ntz data in the future would force all `zindex` nodes to resync from scratch, which sux

[21-Aug-19 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and only count hts that advance

[21-Aug-19 01:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i am in very hot code

[21-Aug-19 01:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
and this is stats

[21-Aug-19 01:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
so i want to do as little work as possible

[21-Aug-19 01:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a heuristic, some error is OK

[21-Aug-19 01:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
my code modifies ReceiveBlock() or whatever it's called, and LoadIndex, so every block that is received or read from disk has this code run. I don't want to add lots of complex shite

[21-Aug-19 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What deermines a valid notaraisation is:
1) height is heighter than last noatrised ht
2) block hash matches the ht being notarized
3) min sigs notaries

[21-Aug-19 01:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
probably looking for amount would filter out stuff

[21-Aug-19 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can filter the NNmin sigs early on... as it adds ot the index.

[21-Aug-19 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then when fetching just flter the ht

[21-Aug-19 01:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r right now, a valid ntz in my code is "vin=13, vout=2" and that works pretty damn well to detect ntz's üôÇ

[21-Aug-19 01:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am just trying to detect, not verify

[21-Aug-19 01:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
i need to filter on amount and maybe op_return, and it would be 99.99% correct

[21-Aug-19 01:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
right now, if you happen to spend 13 utxos, and generate a change address, my code is fooled by that

[21-Aug-19 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
assuming no body made false ones.. that will usually work, that is the first check the validation makes

[21-Aug-19 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
include op)_return to that

[21-Aug-19 01:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
thanks for the nspv_wallet.h link, it's a good read

[21-Aug-19 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
vout[1].IsOpreturn()

[21-Aug-19 01:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have read similar code in all the dpow header files

[21-Aug-19 01:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r now that is useful!

[21-Aug-19 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nSPV stuff taugt me alot.

[21-Aug-19 01:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
.IsOpreturn() is mighty fine

[21-Aug-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that should do it man

[21-Aug-19 01:10 AM] dukeleto#7326

[21-Aug-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a function in nspv_utils

[21-Aug-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that decodes the opret

[21-Aug-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I doubt you need that

ZEC is switching to a 75s blocktime on the Blossom NU

[21-Aug-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i think that my use of int64_t for some stats is wasteful (per-block stats will never need such a large datatype), so I am going to refactor those to `unsigned int`. I will leave total chain stats as int64_t, since that seems more future-proof. `-zindex` is working, with reindex detection. And I have notarization stats as well. To finally merge this stuff to KMD, it needs to know how to look at sprout joinsplits

@mrlynch maybe i can help you with that, it's something hush wants too

[21-Aug-19 02:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
and `voluntold` is hilarious, gotta remember that

[21-Aug-19 03:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
definition
```"Voluntarily Told," "Voluntold"

There are two different kinds of voluntold:
A. The gunny walks into the office and says, "Man, wouldn't the floor look nice if somebody buffed it?" Which means,"Buff the floor."

B. "I need two volunteers to stand out in front of Best Buy this Saturday collecting Toys for Tots."
" ... "
"Jones, Smith, you're collecting Toys for Tots this weekend." ```

that is intriguing, and ties into Hush+Pirate wanting TAILS integration @mrlynch

[21-Aug-19 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
and that txrate is "4.002 notarization transactions per hour, in the last month on HUSH mainnet"

[21-Aug-19 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
11403 total on mainnet, and 2902 in the "window" of 1 month

[21-Aug-19 10:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX we can graph the daily ntz rate of each chain versus it's monthly average, might be a good metric of ntz health of that particular chain. That will take into account on-demand chains having long ntz gaps as well

let's build a page to show off the stats for Hush, while we work on getting the code compat for other chains

my new `zindex` code seems to break the block index of nodes, even when it's not enabled

[23-Aug-19 03:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
I tried switching to an older branch but the blockindex seems busted now

[23-Aug-19 03:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
so something I am doing, is only compatible with `zindex` enabled

[23-Aug-19 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The blockindex can be diffrent for diffrent AC params... example here may help?

@blackjok3r hush3.git `duke` branch, it's my zindex code that is doing this

[23-Aug-19 09:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r `zindex` changes the things written out in CBlockIndex
