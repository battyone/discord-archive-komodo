oh, if we trust them to hold the coins and also to enforce trades, then we can't even know if they are stealing or not

[22-Mar-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
entire set of invisible attacks a CEX can do to squeeze money out of the traders

[22-Mar-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is half a solution

[22-Mar-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
better than no solution but not the full solution

[22-Mar-19 10:08 PM] zack#6467
it is like using a seal instead of a lock. You can at least know if someone opened the box while you were gone

[22-Mar-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so a real world case of a trusted token on a blockchain

[22-Mar-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the world is not as extreme as your views

[22-Mar-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and not 100% of all things blockchain are assumed to be trustless

[22-Mar-19 10:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
also...
```Just because I want a hard update to happen doesn't mean I can get it to happen. Sometimes the mining pool operators make me set up a testnet first so they can try it out.```
does that mean that mining pool operators, let's say some that bought a false outcome can prevent you from hard forking to "truth"?

[22-Mar-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the consensus, basic transactions, sure

[22-Mar-19 10:09 PM] zack#6467
So there are different levels of trustedness. I wonder if it is really continuous, or if there are discrete levels of trust.

[22-Mar-19 10:10 PM] zack#6467
I wonder if the math works the same for each flavor of trustedness

[22-Mar-19 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a trust quanta, but likely it is effectively continuous as there is really a very large variety of trustedness

[22-Mar-19 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and likely nearly impossible to fully analyze

[22-Mar-19 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if reputations can be abstracted away, maybe it can be

[22-Mar-19 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so when analyzing a specific usage, if it doesnt increase the level of trust required, then even if it isnt trustless, it didnt increase the trust required and did no harm

[22-Mar-19 10:12 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why gateways CC using oracles CC doesnt increase the trustedness

[22-Mar-19 10:12 PM] zack#6467
seals vs locks is a pretty solid difference possible for doors in physical space, it is interesting how much your example is like a seal instead of a lock. it makes me feel like there is only a handful of levels of trustedness.

[22-Mar-19 10:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the big trust is in the 7of 13 multisig signers

[22-Mar-19 10:13 PM] jl777c#5810
likely most things would be in similar levels

[22-Mar-19 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but with the entire universe potentially headed to blockchain, there is likely some edge case at every level of trustedness. seems very hard to disprove or even come up with a non-qualitative measure

[22-Mar-19 10:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I should do some bad things so that Amoveo community will stop trusting my updates and it will be more secure.`
Your hyperbole and sarcasm aside, are you willing to no longer be involved and just walk away if the network decides the outcome of oracles by hard forking the code to code you don't control?

[22-Mar-19 10:15 PM] zack#6467
On somem level the cryptocurrency projects are competing with each other.
If you have theft occur 2% of the time, it is the same as having a 2% fee to use your blockchain.

So it seems like if total cryptoeconomic security is possible, it will win.

Like, why would you trust the 7 of 13 when you could use a synthetic asset instead?

[22-Mar-19 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I notice you keep using buzzwords when you're avoiding uncomfortable questions; that's an interesting tell

[22-Mar-19 10:16 PM] zack#6467
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I do a lot of stuff in Amoveo besides programming. I would still be involved, even if they stopped using any code I write.

[22-Mar-19 10:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that is not an answer, but an evasion

[22-Mar-19 10:17 PM] zack#6467
I would not walk away from Amoveo, even if they stopped using my code. I love this project.

[22-Mar-19 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
synthetic asset is capped at 100%, people would be sad when it moons 10x

[22-Mar-19 10:17 PM] zack#6467
what do you mean "capped at 100%"?

[22-Mar-19 10:17 PM] zack#6467
what moons?

[22-Mar-19 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
you said gains are capped at 100%

[22-Mar-19 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt the real thing, someone has to pay for the volatility

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] zack#6467
you can make the  margin whatever you want

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
having the tokenized crypto, it is just like owning the real thing (if you ignore trusting the redemption will happen)

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] zack#6467
it is better than the real thing. with derivatives you can have leverage, you can put it into state channels.

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
why use "synthetic assets" when "financial derivatives" already exist?

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ibid

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] zack#6467
a synthetic asset is a kind of financial derivative.

[22-Mar-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
what if there is no counterparty?

[22-Mar-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant establish the synthetic position

[22-Mar-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
lackof liquidity

[22-Mar-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
tokenized crypto doesnt have this problem

[22-Mar-19 10:19 PM] zack#6467
There is enough demand for veo-long contracts, that in Amoveo people actually get paid to hold stablecoin sythetic assets.

[22-Mar-19 10:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That works until it doesnt

[22-Mar-19 10:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
```A derivative is a financial security with a value that is reliant upon, or derived from, an underlying asset or group of assets. ```
how is that different from what you're describing?

[22-Mar-19 10:22 PM] zack#6467
so, the purpose of using the btc-tokens inside komodo is to sell them, right?
If no one wants to be your counterparty for a synthetic asset, wouldn't that also mean that no one wants to be your counterparty  to buy those btc-tokens from you?

[22-Mar-19 10:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
or is it called synthetic asset just to avoid the howey test?

[22-Mar-19 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
not necessarily, maybe people would want to use some CC with BTC

[22-Mar-19 10:23 PM] zack#6467
a synthetic asset is a financial derivative or group of financial derivatives held together which stay the same value as some other asset.
So a synthetic USD is a stablecoin USD.

[22-Mar-19 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
since BTC will never get CC directly, creating tokenized BTC on a CC chain would allow it

[22-Mar-19 10:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
so a derivative.. why fumble with words?

[22-Mar-19 10:24 PM] zack#6467
a synthetic USD has a leverage of 1. if you make the leverage anything else, then it isn't a synthetic asset any  more, but it is still a financial derivative

[22-Mar-19 10:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If someone with trading knowledge gets to your platform they could either short you into bankruptcy or create coins out of thin air... depending on the system.

[22-Mar-19 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the key difference is that no counterparty is required for tokenizing the crypto

[22-Mar-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why fumble with words?`
To avoid 🐔s?

[22-Mar-19 10:25 PM] jl777c#5810
and you can get BTC valued tokens or even coins on a CC enabled chain

[22-Mar-19 10:25 PM] zack#6467
if there is no counterparty, then why use komodo at all? just hold your btc on bitcoin

[22-Mar-19 10:25 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you want to play multiplayer rogue in a winner take all battle, denominated in BTC

[22-Mar-19 10:25 PM] zack#6467
you must be doing something with them on komodo for it to make sense, right?

[22-Mar-19 10:25 PM] Alright#0419
so you can use oracles with it

that is some videogame to compete for the cryptocurrency?

[22-Mar-19 10:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that's my point as well.. call it what it is then you fail howey test and need to go through financial regs

[22-Mar-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a blockchain enforced gameplay

[22-Mar-19 10:26 PM] zack#6467
I don't live in USA. howey test doesn't matter.

[22-Mar-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810

it does if you list on us exchange

[22-Mar-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
that one is fully trustless

[22-Mar-19 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if there is no counterparty, then why use komodo at all? just hold your btc on bitcoin`
One obvious reason would be to avoid the insane chain fees whenever someone "wants to prove a point" on the BTC chain and you want to do something with the coinage (like use it as currency)

[22-Mar-19 10:27 PM] zack#6467
I don't like exchanges. I want trustless atomic swaps.

[22-Mar-19 10:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[22-Mar-19 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
we have that too

[22-Mar-19 10:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
since you mentioned trustless again

[22-Mar-19 10:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

```Just because I want a hard update to happen doesn't mean I can get it to happen. Sometimes the mining pool operators make me set up a testnet first so they can try it out.```

does that mean that mining pool operators, let's say some that bought a false outcome can prevent you from hard forking to "truth"?

[22-Mar-19 10:28 PM] zack#6467
Why can't you play rogue on a normal server? deposit BTC, play, then withdraw?
The server could keep publishing signed merkel roots of all the game state, so you can verify if they cheated.

[22-Mar-19 10:29 PM] zack#6467
that would give the same level of security you  have with the multi-sig, right?

[22-Mar-19 10:29 PM] jl777c#5810
how can you prove they didnt cheat and fake the NFT data?

[22-Mar-19 10:29 PM] zack#6467
if your balance is different from the data they show you, then they cheated

[22-Mar-19 10:30 PM] zack#6467
or if they give different data to each customer, you can know they cheated

[22-Mar-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
you would need to trust the server about other players games

[22-Mar-19 10:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if your balance is different from the data they show you, then they cheated`
Or your client is wrong

[22-Mar-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
with rogue all the user keystrokes are put into opreturn, (which is like an oracle CC but just lower level)

[22-Mar-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810

[22-Mar-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
then all nodes replay the entire game using the keystrokes and compare the final data to what was claimed

[22-Mar-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
no cheating possible

[22-Mar-19 10:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's a flawed assumption to make that what you see is more accurate than the consensus chain and that someone cheated because you don't agree with consensus

[22-Mar-19 10:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
```I don't like exchanges. I want trustless atomic swaps.```
and yet you are listed on exchanges

[22-Mar-19 10:32 PM] zack#6467
a single merkel root should be enough to fully specify every key press of the game.
If the server publishes the merkel root, and all the players can verify that they received the same merkel root, then they can know the game executed correctly. 
Then lots of merkel proofs can be used to check that any moment of the game was calculated correctly.

[22-Mar-19 10:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think @zack should migrate to komodo assetchain

[22-Mar-19 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
currently the most you can do is not submit keystrokes, but I am adding realtime attestations by external nodes to make sure keystrokes are being sent in realtime and any node will be able to dispute invalid data (from the signed events broadcasted)

[22-Mar-19 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes will know if a game was broadcasting keystrokes in realtime and the final set of keystrokes had no invalid ones

[22-Mar-19 10:34 PM] zack#6467
is the game secure against sybil?
Poker doesn't work if one person can sign up for the same table more than once.

[22-Mar-19 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can play more than one game at once, go ahead

[22-Mar-19 10:34 PM] zack#6467
oh, I thought a single game had more than 2 players
