Only way I could think of at the time was coding it into a special wallets

[04-Sep-19 02:28 PM] Regnar#6164
So yea, like that

[04-Sep-19 02:29 PM] Regnar#6164
Or a contract with expiration date and someway to ensure it is only spent once. Lock funds, spend offline, redeem when expires

[04-Sep-19 02:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, Channels CC is also fast and dPoW secured funds. so that must cover the offline time on flights etc.

[04-Sep-19 02:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar it's possible to send funds to somebody else via QR code, via a signed raw transaction

[04-Sep-19 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
but they cannot confirm the funds are valid without a network connection

[04-Sep-19 02:58 PM] Regnar#6164
So someone could sign a bunch of txs of the same funds to different people, and let whoever gets online first to broadcast, claim them

[04-Sep-19 02:59 PM] Regnar#6164
That was the issue I was running into in my head

[04-Sep-19 03:00 PM] Regnar#6164
Even indexing them doesn't help, index all of them 1 lol. Unless the index was generated somehow in a way that the spender couldn't change, why I was thinking it had to be within the wallet code

[04-Sep-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think that solves your use case. BCH and DASH people use them extensively

[04-Sep-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar it's a bit centralized, but gets the thing you want done

[04-Sep-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
And yes, I have seen people give these tips out and the server claimed the reward within hours

[04-Sep-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
No networking is needed to give a tip

[04-Sep-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
but you do need networking to claim a tip or spend it

17 new malicious npm modules found, doesn't that make you want to trust your wallet.dat to Javascript?

@Regnar bluetooth is insecure.   even when they say it's secure, it's insecure.   there was a link posted 2 weeks ago about key negotiation weakness.

the whole point of bluetooth (which was a viking king who wanted to talk to everyone) is to have a relatively open connection interface.

[04-Sep-19 04:36 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea makes sense why we keep crypto away from it... unless you want to rain coins on everyone ðŸšŽ

Nasty Glupteba malware uses Bitcoin blockchain to keep itself alive
Cybersecurity researchers have discovered an innovative new strain of malware that loads Bitcoin transactions with malicious OP_RETURN data.

[05-Sep-19 01:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright they are storing encrypted C+C servers in OP_RETURN

[05-Sep-19 01:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
how long until they realize the memo field gives them more privacy?

[05-Sep-19 01:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
and cheaper, lol

[05-Sep-19 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
pretty interesting, but not surprising at all

[05-Sep-19 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
you can write something to BTC then fetch it from like a hundred different APIs

[05-Sep-19 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
can't really think of anything else like that

[05-Sep-19 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
not even APIs, electrum servers in this case

[05-Sep-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is more technical

[05-Sep-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright natural evolution of botnets, but it's interesting because it means infosec is headed in our direction

[05-Sep-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
all those infosec people gonna need to understand OP_RETURN ðŸ˜…

[05-Sep-19 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
it's the "do nothing" op code

[05-Sep-19 02:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
lulz

[05-Sep-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
literally "return"

[05-Sep-19 02:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
i mean how it can be used to embed arbitrary data that can be utilized by botnets ðŸ™‚

[05-Sep-19 02:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
they truly don't care about Bitcoin Script

[05-Sep-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
surely people are using ipfs for the same thing

[05-Sep-19 02:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
but they will need to learn some

[05-Sep-19 02:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright ipfs doesn't have very well maintained public electrum servers

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
you don't need to learn anything to understand opreturn

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
that hinges on public electrum servers

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
it's literally "do nothing"

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
here's a bunch of data, don't do anything with it

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright you don't understand how little infosec people know

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
thing about monkey hitting keys with their genitalia

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
those monkeys know more than most infosec people

[05-Sep-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
electrum servers may have OP_RETURN data pruned, no?

[05-Sep-19 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
so pretty shit way to do it

[05-Sep-19 02:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
Zcash protocol chains wouldn't work well for this, because there is no light wallet, yet. and light wallets don't support memo fields

[05-Sep-19 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
would be better off using any random opcode, so it's for sure not pruned

{Reactions}
PeepoThink 

[05-Sep-19 02:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
so ZP coins are no viable

[05-Sep-19 02:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
this will infect the op-return-space of all BTC clones, tho, if they are cheaper and still usable

[05-Sep-19 02:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright btc core would love that

[05-Sep-19 02:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
or just use address data as data

[05-Sep-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
`<data> OP_CHECKSIG` should work I think

[05-Sep-19 02:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
like old skool BTC

[05-Sep-19 02:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
before OP_RETURN

[05-Sep-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
and it wouldn't get pruned

[05-Sep-19 02:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
just put it in the address data, lulz

[05-Sep-19 02:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
somebody embedded the BTC PDF in the address data of a mega multisig xtn long ago

[05-Sep-19 02:13 AM] Alright#0419
and now wondering why anyone uses OP_RETURN at all? is `<arbitrary data> OP_CHECKSIG` not standard?

[05-Sep-19 02:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
not sure

[05-Sep-19 02:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
before OP_RETURN, there was no way

[05-Sep-19 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
well my point is that if you can store arbitrary data in script without OP_RETURN(surely there is a way), it wouldn't get pruned

[05-Sep-19 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
doubt that ðŸ˜›

[05-Sep-19 02:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
what I mean, no way to store data and it not be pruned

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
OP_RETURN *are* pruned

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
OP_RETURN was added to do that

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
That is the feature

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
Not being pruned is a bug

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
i was incorrect, we agree

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
stupid words

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
`<arbitary data> OP_1`?

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
OP_RETURN is just being nice, nobody *needs* to use it

[05-Sep-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
should always eval to 1, yes? ðŸ˜…

[05-Sep-19 02:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are many many checks on the "standardness" of scripts, not sure

[05-Sep-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
nah, man I'm pretty stupid when it comes to script

[05-Sep-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can just change it to whatever you like... get an unused op code and add to the switch case

[05-Sep-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
really *just* learning, trying to learn more

[05-Sep-19 02:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
we all are

[05-Sep-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did similar thing for earlytxid thing for THC

[05-Sep-19 02:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
I didn't know a single bit of this shit 3 years ago. I mined BTC in bliss back in the day, never looked at the code ðŸ‘¼

[05-Sep-19 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no KMD chains can prune

[05-Sep-19 02:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User correct, dpow + pruning are not really compat. But a full node can relay and be pruned

[05-Sep-19 02:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
itself will not know which xtns are notarized, tho

[05-Sep-19 02:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
it won't have the data to tell

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘Œ 

[05-Sep-19 02:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
nSPV is somewhat changing this

[05-Sep-19 02:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
we might be able to leverage nSPV for amazing new things

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘† 

[05-Sep-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, it shaould make things much easiar

[05-Sep-19 02:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe there can be some kind of crazy dpow + pruning + nspv node

[05-Sep-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
txindex is set by defgault and the pruneing code cannot be entered

[05-Sep-19 02:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
the amazingsauce of nSPV covers up some of the hungriness of being `pruned`

[05-Sep-19 02:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r txindex is only for KMD interest

[05-Sep-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nSPV allows ntaries to fetch getinfo from other notaries...

[05-Sep-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no not true

[05-Sep-19 02:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
well, if we can leverage nspv

[05-Sep-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
myGetTransaction 
needs it

[05-Sep-19 02:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am very familiar with that function
