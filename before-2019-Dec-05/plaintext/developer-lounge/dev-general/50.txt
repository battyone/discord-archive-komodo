that is some cool stuff

[02-Nov-18 07:13 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
What if someone created a currency that has:

-  The strong Privacy of $ARRR or $KMD
 + 
- The (decentralised) Stability of MakerDao: https://makerdao.com/whitepaper/

Would that be possible?

What if someone made a currancy that had all blockchains ... using a single coin .....

[02-Nov-18 07:57 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this new paper seems very interesting, to my limited understanding it could allow cross-chain tx without MoMoM and can be done with CC: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1048.pdf

[02-Nov-18 08:04 AM] Alright#0419
Skimming through it, it seems very similar. I'm not sure how they are determining who is giving valid proofs yet though

[02-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
`As long as at least one honestly generated proof œÄ is provided, the verifier‚Äôs security ensures that the output will correspond to whether the event actually occurred.`

[02-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
how?

[02-Nov-18 08:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be just using something like the code we have now, where it just scans a while range of blocks for the right proof... until it finds one

[02-Nov-18 08:10 AM] Alright#0419
```
Upon submission of a proof to the submit-event-proof function, the event is tentatively accepted for a contestation period of k blocks, during which any other party, the contester , can provide a counter-proof showing that the original proof was fraudulent. The contester can call the submit- contesting-proof function passing it the contesting proof œÄ ‚àó and the event predicate e . The function runs the NIPoPoW verify algorithm to compare the original proof events [ e ] . proof against the contesting proof œÄ ‚àó . If the verification algorithm concludes that the original proof was fraudulent, the tentatively accepted event is abandoned and the collateral is paid to the contester
```

[02-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Alright#0419
it is very similar except for the fact that anyone can submit proofs(momom) rather than notaries having to collectively agree on a proof

[02-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Alright#0419
but I don't understand how it can determine if a proof is valid or not

[02-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Alright#0419
eclipse attack the network with false proofs that say you just burned a bajillion coins on source chain, claim them on target chain?

[02-Nov-18 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c very interesting paper, worth reading

[02-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Alright#0419
lol I honestly had to check the date of that after reading to see if this is what momom was based on

[02-Nov-18 08:23 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
both authors are on twitter and have emails, I can ask questions later

[02-Nov-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
MoMoM was already implemented before this paper was started it seems. this is a challenge/response method with the assumption that if nobody challenges it, it must be true. sort of a global opt-out system. depending on the number of proofs being submitted, the economic reward available for disproving, maybe there is enough incentive to "mine" for the invalid proofs. It just seems quite complicated to allow all proofs in the system, then remove the ones that are disproven, than to just use MoMoM and keep things clean to begin with.

The .h files are in DEFS and I used pragma once

[02-Nov-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
including the .cpp file this time, didnt work.

[02-Nov-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810

[02-Nov-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks you ü§ó

[02-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Mihailo#5902
You probably included some .h that includes komodo_structs.h and in CCUtils you have include of CCincludes.h

[02-Nov-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I had to do something that it didnt like, and there is files included twice

[02-Nov-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was the smallest amount of errors I was able to reduce it to

[02-Nov-18 11:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
It is ok to include both CCinclude.h and komodo_structs.h but this is probably first time someone included them and there is collision in redefinition.

[02-Nov-18 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Maybe @jl777c  knows how to do it easily ...

[02-Nov-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
I usually put a function in the code where it is happy (CCutils.cpp) and then call that function from where it isnt working

[02-Nov-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
why try to solve a big mystery, when it is easy to make a modular code that avoids the problem

[02-Nov-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if it hurts, dont do it

I am happy to announce on behalf of Marmara community that we have a consensus to continue with Komodo technologies to solve the general credit creation and payment problem in a post-dated cheque circulation manner as used as a common practice already in Turkey. We are establishing our founding team now. We invite developers who feel themselves ready for this challenging task. @jl777c as our main advisor and @dukeleto are already in our founding team. Regards
P.S. Please DM if you are interested and how you can contribute in this challenging task.

Traditionally, imo, a currency can stand on its own and a token requires a parent currency in order to function and exist

[03-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Fai#0350
cool. I've seen people use cryptocurrency and protocol interchangably

I am looking for a good way  to create notarization data in regtest mode (so dpowconfs can have better automated tests), if somebody has thought about this already, let me know of your good ideas :abusedsmily:

[04-Nov-18 09:34 PM] Lanii#8302
Hello, is someone working on getting more liquidity on to  Barterdex?

[04-Nov-18 11:50 PM] Mylo#8306
@dukeleto how does notarization data get in there.

[04-Nov-18 11:50 PM] Mylo#8306
?

[05-Nov-18 05:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo iguana creates the transactions, which makes things challenging. What I want to do is hook up iguana to regtest, have it generate some notarization xtns, and then hopefully save the rawtransaction hex, so it can be rebroadcast from the python regtests, without having to run iguana

In case of any node??? e.g if I'm running just two staking nodes

[05-Nov-18 09:19 AM] gcharang#6833
They are called notary nodes. They are elected once a year by the community. They save kmd's blockhashes to Bitcoin and any assetchain/external chains with dPOW available to KMD chain.

change that line for regtest mode to say notarised ... that will make every tx a notrisation ... maybe have a random number or a static counter to set it at exactly 10 blocks.

use the TXSCL/PIZZA exception so any pubkey is a vaild notarisation.

[05-Nov-18 02:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r that is starting to sound viable

[05-Nov-18 02:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r is it possible to allow just 1 pubkey to make a ntz in regtest, or does there still need to be multiple?

[05-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You might not be ablt to get it to make a fully valid notarisation, like with the right block hash .. but you can just skip the check and say its valid

[05-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you set it right, the coinbase is a notarisation

[05-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[05-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just use a staic counter ...

[05-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so every 10 vblocks the coinbase = notatiration

[05-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
reset counter

[05-Nov-18 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might work..

[05-Nov-18 02:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
even just a single notarization in regetst, would allow me to write various tests

[05-Nov-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, so what it does, is look for txs by the list of pubkeys,  if the list of pubkeys / 5 is les than 1 .. any transaction by one of those is valid notarisation

[05-Nov-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you use the PIZZA excetipn it can use any pubkey

[05-Nov-18 02:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
