Can you explain me why it's not possible to reach 51% from Bitcoin or Ethereum hashrate? And how realistic is a quantum computer?

[31-Jul-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
1. It is, it's just hard. 2) They already exist

[31-Jul-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
VerusCoin is a KMD fork that uses a quantum-resistant hash function, VerusHash: veruscoin.io

[31-Jul-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It might be quantum resitant, but it requires "cryptographic" functions of modern CPU's which all contain a hardware back door.

[31-Jul-18 07:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r not quite, I am talking about an abstract property of the hash function, you are talking about efficiently mining

[31-Jul-18 07:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
Quantum computers can bruteforce double-sha256 and Equihash much more effectively, no such speedup exists for VerusHash, i.e. quantum computers are not more effective against it

[31-Jul-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure QC can do hashing efficiently

[31-Jul-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
mathematical functiions yes, hashing not so much

VerusHash is basically a variable-input extension of Haraka v2, which has a bunch of stuff about attacks with QC's in this paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/098.pdf

@dukeleto seriously, do you think that "development" includes (and yes, I'm paraphrasing) "We're looking into a way that is better in every way than how we've been doing it for the last decade and should have done it to begin with because the copyright was up before we ever did anything" ?

@Mylo `bt all` will show you a lot of data, but line 668 is most likely dereferencing the `block` pointer or something else is undefined and being dereferenced without a null check

[02-Aug-18 11:29 AM] bogybogy#3962
I have a question and I hope someone can help me...I try to understand from technical view Komodo against stellar,i hold kmd and I believe in decentralized ecosystem .... someone mentioned that stellar has scalability and is decentralized ,faster and the partenship with IBM and support from them will make stellar massive,erc20 atomik swap with stellar network....I will appreciate some advice

[02-Aug-18 11:30 AM] bogybogy#3962
users can imagine their kin token being split into two equal parts ‚Äì one that runs on stellar and one that runs on ethereum. Using¬†atomic swaps, an in-progress technology that allows cryptocurrencies to be traded across blockchains, the company will lock up a kin token's stellar half when its ERC-20 (the ethereum standard for crypto tokens) half leaves the app, and vice versa......

[02-Aug-18 12:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is the question?

[02-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
searching through the API documentation, but haven't found what I'm looking for.

How can I learn about API commands, whether via CLI or to a kmd.explorer website, to pull data about network activity. 

A few questions I'm curious about:

- Pulling data about recent trading activity on BarterDEX, network-wide
- Length of time since last t --> z transaction on KMD
- Length of time since last z --> t transaction on KMD
- Amount of total (z) KMD processed in both directions over last X amount of time (looking only for z transactions that were from/to a t address, obviously)
- Pulling available liquidity on BarterDEX for select pairs

[02-Aug-18 12:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It would also be nice to get the t/z transaction activity visible on asset chains, come to think of it.

[02-Aug-18 12:59 PM] bogybogy#3962
@dukeleto I try to understand where will be the issue if people will use a stellar blockchain instead of Komodo blockchain when we know is centralised blockchain and how you can have same amount of coins on erc20 and on the stellar blockchain....where kmd explain very simple how is working the atomic swaps between blockchain platforms and they are leaders in this field

In regtest mode there's no block rewards after 101 blocks like with bitcoin regtest.  same with ACs.  good news is calling `faucetinfo` returned
```
komodo-cli -regtest  faucetinfo

  "funding": "0.00000000"

not sure if you're familiar with bitcoin regtest, but after 100 blocks you get the first block reward of 50BTC https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-examples#regtest-mode

```
komodo-cli -regtest getgenerate

```
you can't set it to true with `komodo-cli -regtest setgenerate true 101`
```
error code: -32601
error message:
Use the generate method instead of setgenerate on this network
```
And so you use `generate` and you only generate blocks.  No block reward - so you can't actually send anything cos no coins exist.
HTH

[02-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Mylo#8306
hopefully that's coherent enough.  it's nearly 4am, not sure how much longer i'm going to be around, so will just have a few hour nap methinks.

[02-Aug-18 07:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo maybe we should change the port of regtest on KMD, looks like I forgot that

[02-Aug-18 07:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
because I can't run a normal kmd server and regtest on the same machine (port conflict)

[02-Aug-18 07:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
ALSO, if you ignore the error message that it cannot start it's HTTP server and run `komodo-cli  -regtest getinfo` it works!!! But it's not regtest. Because regtest + mainnet have the same port, which seems like a üí© idea

[02-Aug-18 07:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
choosing port numbers, gotta think of something good

[02-Aug-18 07:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
```Generate 101 blocks using a special RPC which is only available in regtest mode. This takes less than a second on a generic PC. Because this is a new block chain using Bitcoin‚Äôs default rules, the first blocks pay a block reward of 50 bitcoins. Unlike mainnet, in regtest mode only the first 150 blocks pay a reward of 50 bitcoins. However, a block must have 100 confirmations before that reward can be spent, so we generate 101 blocks to get access to the coinbase transaction from block #1.```

[02-Aug-18 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is where things sound üê† `And so you use generate and you only generate blocks.  No block reward - so you can't actually send anything cos no coins exist.`

[02-Aug-18 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
by default, the first 150 blocks have a block reward in regtest (I am not sure if the regtest we inherited from ZEC is different, I will look). So if you generate more blocks, you should definitely see the block reward

[02-Aug-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
just use -ac_supply=100000000

[02-Aug-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
then you have many coins

[02-Aug-18 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
`bitcoin-cli -regtest generate 251` in theory would generate all the regtest coins, since it has 150 + 100 for it to be mature, plus 1 for extra luck

[02-Aug-18 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have seen the "generate 101 blocks" stuff in Zcash tests, that looks familiar and they probably kept that the same. But ZEC has that slow ramp up junk and founders reward stuff, kmd doesn't, so I don't know if our regtest modes have slight differences

[02-Aug-18 07:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
BTC core defines a static port (18443) in their chainparams.cpp, ZEC has 18232

[02-Aug-18 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD kept the 18232

[02-Aug-18 08:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
`generate 101` seems kind of slow, how long does it take for you @Mylo ?

[02-Aug-18 08:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
it being this slow is one of the reasons the test suite is so slow, each test file usually generates new blocks for all the tests in that file. It took close to a minute for me, it should be closer to a few seconds

[02-Aug-18 08:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
```$ komodo-cli  -regtest getwalletinfo
{
  "walletversion": 60000,
  "balance": 100000000.00000000,

[02-Aug-18 08:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo i followed your instructions, and I get a bunch of coins like I expect

[02-Aug-18 08:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
100,000,000 regtest KMD, I need a boat

[02-Aug-18 08:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am still unsure if there is a bug, where the port defined in chainparams.cpp for regtest is ignored and it used the normal port for some reason. You can always use a custom port with `-rpcport=xxx` too
