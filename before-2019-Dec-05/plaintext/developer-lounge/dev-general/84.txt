so that when it goes to add them back in, it only has txs that were not in the block

[14-Dec-18 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this should also make the list a heap smaller speeding up processing

[14-Dec-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe have a savemempool that is a snapshot of the mempool before any of this

[14-Dec-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
then restore just those tx to get back to the original mempool

[14-Dec-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what it does

[14-Dec-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll play around with it... I keep forking test chains

[14-Dec-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there will be a solution

[14-Dec-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
agreed

[14-Dec-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it can 
remove any txs that are added to the mempool from the tempmempool

[14-Dec-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this will reduce the size ofd the temp mempool. and also stop it trying to add huge amoutns of invlid txs

[14-Dec-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also doesnt seem to need a temp mempool. a List works just fine too.

OK Thanks. It's a bit confusing as it's tagged as pre-release and in description is written do not use

[14-Dec-18 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
any tips on how to find a lock up?
I have got it going pretty fast now but when I flood txs it locks the mining node.

[14-Dec-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
one way is to "binary search" disabling code to narrow down what is causing the lockup

[14-Dec-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the same LOCK() is being called after it was already called, that would cause a deadlock

[14-Dec-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... its only on the miner so at least I have somewhere to start I guess

[14-Dec-18 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007
@TheTrunk i updated the description now

[14-Dec-18 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007

Fix Mempool fix by blackjok3rtt ¬∑ Pull Request #1076 ¬∑ jl777/komodo
Fixed all lockups that I can see.
This fix is fine, it doesn't need to check each tx when putting back, as when the next block is found it clears out all orphans anyway.
By making it remove the...

[14-Dec-18 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wasnt able to change it to a tx list rather than a mempool, because the tx differed slightly and didnt allow it to be removed. But this does not matter, because not its not doing mempool checks multiple times anymore, so has removed all those addtowallet and accepttomempool prints.

[14-Dec-18 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
In the rare case there is an invalid tx in a nodes mempool, it wil just stay in that nodes mempool as would normally happen.  Other nodes wont accept it.

Is there a stable coin that allows ztransactions?

ui just checked it now

[16-Dec-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Dec-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know if anyhting si wrong, so I cant answer that question.. just check you have the latest master or dev version of komodod ... and restart the daemons see what it does.

[16-Dec-18 06:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[16-Dec-18 06:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 06:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it says rescanning

[16-Dec-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its rescanning

[16-Dec-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to wait for it to finish

[16-Dec-18 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a PITA I know ... I tried for days and days to work out why that is happening without much luck

[16-Dec-18 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think with the latest fixes in FSM it might be ok ... but I need to test more.

[16-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Alright#0419
does coinsupply need the indexes enabled?

[16-Dec-18 06:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  the thing is the daemon is now stopped

[16-Dec-18 06:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its stopped

[16-Dec-18 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
other than the two default ones that is

[16-Dec-18 06:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
as it says komodo server stopping

[16-Dec-18 06:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so its stopped succesffully

[16-Dec-18 06:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can i do the upgrade ?

[16-Dec-18 06:45 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto do you know if coinsupply requires all 4 indexes enabled?

[16-Dec-18 06:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
nope

[16-Dec-18 06:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have

[16-Dec-18 06:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
no idea

[16-Dec-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know what your talking about ... just start it with the newest daemon, and set ac_sapling= to a block that hasnt been mined yet.

[16-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Alright#0419
what is he trying to do?

[16-Dec-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no idea

[16-Dec-18 06:53 AM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani you're just trying to get nodes working that weren't updated prior to the hardfork?

[16-Dec-18 07:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes @Alright sorry for the delay

[16-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Alright#0419
What happens after you restart them with latest build?

[16-Dec-18 07:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it continued saying rescanning

[16-Dec-18 07:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but now the server is stopped

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just let it rescan

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have stopped the server

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or start it with -zapwallettxs

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i first update

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and wait ... it will take a fair while

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like now its stopped

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i update the komodo ?

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
by making

[16-Dec-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its not running, update komodo
