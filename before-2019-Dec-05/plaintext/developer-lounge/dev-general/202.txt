where were you on the evening of March 24th, sir?

[10-Aug-19 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c one more thing I want to explain. In BTC internals, "dust" is defined with "<" operator. Less than. There is no lower limit, in internals. There is no definition of "spam", in the internals spam is included in the definition of "dust"

[10-Aug-19 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
So that means, purely mathematically, all spam attacks are dust attacks, but not all dust attacks are  spam attacks

[10-Aug-19 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
and some are de-anon'ing, some aren't. And you can do both at the same time

[10-Aug-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Aug-19 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
I will try to explain this as best I can to the lovely people on Twitter

[10-Aug-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
actually if you send a bigger amount, it is more likely to deanonymize

[10-Aug-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is more likely bitcoind logic includes it in the transaction

[10-Aug-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but the simple workaround is to just combine all dust from the same address to the same address

[10-Aug-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
then 0 information is leaked!

[10-Aug-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
just free money as long as the increased txfee is not more expensive than the dust

[10-Aug-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it would divulge when you did this merging and if you are under surveillance at the router level, maybe your ip can be deanonymized, but that can be done independently of the dust attack

To clarify, there are de-anonymizing dust/spam attacks and those purely for Denial-of-Service. I was speaking of the DoS kind, which all coins inheriting $BTC protocol are vulnerable to.
No $ZEC protocol coin is vulnerable to de-anon dusting.

@CHMEX starting to get raw data about shielded transactions/payments. I need to make the RPC return data in a nice json format, and use the basic stats to derive more useful metrics/etc. But it's moving along nicely

[12-Aug-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
if we look at block 69392 at https://explorer.myhush.org/block/000000000d74e0020b50096a29204fb2ffdda77ffbde057d974e291ebd68e4e0

[12-Aug-19 02:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
Nice! I m very excited about that not to have to parse each trx

[12-Aug-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
we see it has 1 joinsplit, which counts as 1 zpayment, which was not fully shielded

[12-Aug-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX have a look at the definitions of things here (don't worry about the low-level C++ stuff) and let me know if stuff makes sense to you: `https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/pull/27/files`

[12-Aug-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are some weird edge cases, but I think I defined things "correctly"

[12-Aug-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
i.e. how many shielded payments is a (z,z,t,t) => (z,t) transaction? That kind of breaks your brain.

[12-Aug-19 02:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
those don't even occur (z_sendmany can't make them) but when raw xtns are easier, they can happen

[12-Aug-19 02:21 PM] CHMEX#0686
Looks good

[12-Aug-19 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am pretty sure my heuristics are 99.99% correct, most of the time. But I might have some bugs in implementing my heuristics. That needs to be tested

[12-Aug-19 02:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
soon I will run this on Pirate, which will give me much more data. Running it on HUSH mainnet now

[12-Aug-19 02:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
is it very cpu intensive?

[12-Aug-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure, but my guess is no. I didn't add any new loops

[12-Aug-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
I just do a few extra integer math ops for every transaction in the chain

[12-Aug-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
What is more, is RAM usage

[12-Aug-19 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
Let's estimate it's 100 bytes more RAM for every instance of `pindex`

[12-Aug-19 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have no idea how many instances of pindex KMD internals keeps at a time

[12-Aug-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
all in all, it's not going to increase RAM drastically. But it could increase it a few megabytes?

[12-Aug-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
it uses no disk space

[12-Aug-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
everything is memory-only

[12-Aug-19 02:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, maybe I slowed down transaction validation time a bit, not sure. But that usually is not a bottleneck

[12-Aug-19 02:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
and that is not quite accurate. I might have slowed down the time it takes for a node to "receive" blocks, not validate xtns. I hooked into the code that receives blocks and keeps stats about taddrs

```Why JSON is Better Than XML

XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.

For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML:

Using XML

    Fetch an XML document
    Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
    Extract values and store in variables

Using JSON

    Fetch a JSON string
    JSON.Parse the JSON string```

[14-Aug-19 11:59 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes, thanks for the opinions folks!  try to find JSON standards though!!
I made some initial queries with JSON schemas standardization and parsers, there are two aiming for acceptance as RFC but they offer the implementation with it.

This is a problem because KMD codebase already has 2 JSON parsers, the btc one and one in C for The cryptocondition stuff.

I‚Äôm looking for use cases to interconnect systems.  Currently my best two finds are landxml which is a huge system of data used by surveyors, civil & other engineers, architects and government.  Supported by high tech engineering tools as well as autocad, autodesk etc.

The other is Shopify products and orders.

A third is booking.com and the entire travel industry.

I really want an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù integration example, not so much of a learn a whole discipline to extract a small part of data.

XML standards offer many implementations into legacy systems, payroll, education etc.   JSON little interoperability amongst disparate systems.

It‚Äôs for a CClib example with oracles at the end of the day.  Possibly tokens.  I want to be able to show new levels of interoperability.
