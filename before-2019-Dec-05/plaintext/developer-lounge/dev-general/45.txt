at the top of the loop is all that is needed

[28-Oct-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
they code above makes the code non-deterministic

[28-Oct-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
it will randomly skip some utxos based on local entropy

[28-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
this is not in consensus code but in the utxo selection code

[28-Oct-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[28-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it should be < 90

[28-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
then it skips 90% of the time

[28-Oct-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
you could also do various other things, James code above is probably the easiest way

[28-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
would statistically allow 10 players in parallel

[28-Oct-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
you could order all utxos in an array, and then choose a random index inside of that array

[28-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot more complex

[28-Oct-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sounds reasonalble ..although te function counts all the funding utxo aswell

[28-Oct-18 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, and slower

[28-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
to do it "right" you would start at random offset into the loop and iterate loop depth times and would need to have up to 2 times through all the utxo

[28-Oct-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think just copy whole cunction and add james code

[28-Oct-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fast and easy

[28-Oct-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make minimum entropy to bet like 100 and random 90% ?

can anyone help me please

[29-Oct-18 07:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
if possible i have a query about the nodes

[29-Oct-18 11:16 AM] SHossain#0007
what is your query @D.rabbani ?

[29-Oct-18 11:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@SHossain i need to know that what is the concept of duplicate accounts in syncing  its like how one node will know  that the particular account exist in another node I have tried to sync 2 nodes and each of the nodes i have made getnewaddress Danish 
and same in the second one i have made the same getnewaddress Danish
Also the commisision based pubkey is not working as we are providing 99% -ac_perce of -ac_reward is this valid

[29-Oct-18 11:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Also we wwant to mine on one public key only at the moement we are seeing that different addressess are created during mining ?

[29-Oct-18 11:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
please if someone be able to help me out here

[29-Oct-18 11:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Thanks

[29-Oct-18 11:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
alot for the help

[29-Oct-18 11:24 AM] SHossain#0007
if you want to mine at the same address, start the daemon with `-pubkey=` option on any mining node

[29-Oct-18 11:25 AM] SHossain#0007
in that case, all mined funds will got to only 1 address

[29-Oct-18 11:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Thank you @SHossain

[29-Oct-18 11:25 AM] SHossain#0007
```
./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=ASSETS -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=03fe754763c176e1339a3f62ee6b9484720e17ee4646b65a119e9f6370c7004abc -addnode=5.9.102.210 &
```

[29-Oct-18 11:25 AM] SHossain#0007
this is an example of how it may look like with pubkey

[29-Oct-18 11:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Okay so we don't have to set the -ac_perc?

[29-Oct-18 11:29 AM] SHossain#0007
no. that was the param for that chain

[29-Oct-18 11:29 AM] SHossain#0007
with existing param, just add the `-pubkey=` part

[29-Oct-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a chain that can only be mined by ac_pubkey address, that will be merged in later on. If thats what you were looking for.

[29-Oct-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@SHossain  can you please tell me what is the difference between rpc- bind and addnode ?

[29-Oct-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Thanks

[29-Oct-18 11:46 AM] SHossain#0007
`rpcbind=127.0.0.1` will bind the daemon to local node. `addnode=` is the node where you sync the chain from

[29-Oct-18 11:46 AM] SHossain#0007
addnode ip is primarily the ip of seednode

[29-Oct-18 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ok  thanks @SHossain  one last question i want to know about can i add staked method in the above command ? just like staked =100 ?

[29-Oct-18 11:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because i am testing to make it fully based on proof of stake on 100%\

[29-Oct-18 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked=100 will make the chain fully PoS, but starting those chains is tricky. You need to split the funds into 64 segids before block 128

[29-Oct-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so its better to make it hybrid ?

[29-Oct-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
cant we start directly with staked =100

[29-Oct-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont need to have any PoW as long as you stake properly,

[29-Oct-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is nothing staking, or no PoW a mixed chain will eventually just stop

[29-Oct-18 11:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[29-Oct-18 12:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  i just want to ask that in the master node will it display the accounts of other nodes ?  just as if we have two nodes and i  made an account on other node will that be visible on master node as well thorugh list accounts ?

[29-Oct-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no I dont think so, they are just normal nodes, just like any BTC clone

[29-Oct-18 12:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okay so for example i am trying to syn to other node ? right and if i made an account such as get account address "dani " 
 and on the master node if  i listaccounts will it show the account ? that is being created on other node and if not ? why ? how do we satisfy ourselvess as the nodes are synced can you elaborate in detail please

[29-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Mylo#8306
is it possible to change an assetchain from PoW to PoS at blockheight, hard forking it?

[29-Oct-18 12:32 PM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
@Mylo  yes you can by adding this flag -ac_staked=100

{Reactions}
🙏 

[29-Oct-18 12:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and another thing i want to know an exact detail about  128th blocks like if its changed to pos 100% through what we can split our funds into 64 segids

[29-Oct-18 12:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can someone elaborate thanks

[29-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus did you come across any PoS 64 seg id documentation in your curation compilation?

[29-Oct-18 12:53 PM] gcharang#6833
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/assetchain-params.html#ac-staked this is the only explanation for it afaik

[29-Oct-18 12:54 PM] gcharang#6833
the 64 addresses in 64 segids can be generated through marketmaker, or you can write a script that produces all the addresses from komodo-cli. `validateaddress` outputs the segid of the address too

i can also see the error of invalid block mined what is it?

[29-Oct-18 01:37 PM] D.rabbani#9094
although we havent done such sort of transactions that it showing invalid

[29-Oct-18 01:40 PM] SHossain#0007
that means, another node submitted the block before node. hence, it is invalid

[29-Oct-18 01:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus I just added `size_on_disk` to `getblockchaininfo`, you probably want to add it to your awesome tech docs

[29-Oct-18 01:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@SHossain  the thing is its repeating invalid for block 101 ?

[29-Oct-18 01:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094

can you help us out seems messed up situation stillin control

[29-Oct-18 02:01 PM] SHossain#0007
as long as another node is mining the block, it is fine

[29-Oct-18 02:01 PM] SHossain#0007
as a general rule, always use the coin name in CAPS

[29-Oct-18 02:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
we are currently testing it

[29-Oct-18 02:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@thankyou for the help

[29-Oct-18 02:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@SHossain  really appreciate you always reply directly

[29-Oct-18 02:03 PM] SHossain#0007
for staking, you need to use `-genproclimit=0` or `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ANUC setgenerate true 0` because you want to use 100% stake. no normal mining needed

[29-Oct-18 02:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okay so either way its ifne yes we need to use 100% POS method

[29-Oct-18 02:04 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to use normal mining on a 100% staked chain, you may get those errors

[29-Oct-18 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
i never tried before, but asset chain names seem to be case in-sensitive

[29-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto 

Thanks, I'll make a note.

@Mylo @gcharang 

There is some documentation available. It's not much.

[29-Oct-18 04:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For any who want to see, here's where the new  api documentation center is currently.

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/slate/#getinfo

[29-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We just need to add info about asset chains, which is nearly done, and then the four cc rpc calls that are accepted into KMD.

I might also spend the time now to add our dex calls.

[29-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
KMD's documentation is getting pretty close to being ready..
