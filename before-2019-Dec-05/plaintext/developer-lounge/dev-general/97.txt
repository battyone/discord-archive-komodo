[21-Dec-18 10:40 AM] Mylo#8306
I don‚Äôt know enough of your setup and only have phone atm.  Best to wait for ppl more familiar with scenario.  Maybe chainzilla can help?

[21-Dec-18 10:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[21-Dec-18 10:40 AM] Mylo#8306
Hit them up whilst nobody else awake or familiar if it‚Äôs critical

[21-Dec-18 10:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it is critical my boss is telling me to try different tactics but i dont need to messup

[21-Dec-18 10:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
as he thinks there is an issue of wallet.dat but its not acutally

[21-Dec-18 10:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094

make sure server is running and you are connecting to the right RPC port )

[21-Dec-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this is the error i get when i try to get info

[21-Dec-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094

nope just doing that now

[21-Dec-18 11:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i only need to update on staking node 1 and 2 right ?

[21-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
which nodes do you want to work correctly?

[21-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
only update those

[21-Dec-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
1 and 2

[21-Dec-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because they are main nodes with staking

[21-Dec-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@Deleted User  do i need to stop my daemon for update to FSM branch or is it not necessary i am thinking about kiling the process

[21-Dec-18 11:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Commad getinfo is for komodo or assetchains? If assetchains where is ac param?

[21-Dec-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its for asset chain

[21-Dec-18 11:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Then you are getting valid rpc error.
You need your assetchain param in command

[21-Dec-18 11:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this is the command

[21-Dec-18 11:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have substituted

[21-Dec-18 02:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094

@blackjok3r  do you know anything ?

[23-Dec-18 08:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[23-Dec-18 01:19 PM] heguli97#5781
What can those risc v boards be used for? I imagine you can do pretty much anything with them but i assume they aren't very powerful in terms of performance.

[24-Dec-18 01:33 PM] Emilis#4916
Hey guys, do you have any guide on upgrading to sapling? I'm trying to find information, but all I can find online are general end-user guides, but nothing for how to actually update my code to work with sapling.

[24-Dec-18 01:33 PM] Emilis#4916
Specifically with how transactions are created/parsed now.

[24-Dec-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
same as for zcash, they have all the technical documents

[24-Dec-18 01:49 PM] Emilis#4916
Okay so I should be able to use a lib that's made for ZCash with sapling support on KMD, thanks

[24-Dec-18 05:46 PM] dukeleto#7326

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ i had to read a lot of code and write a lot of code to reverse engineer some of that data, so enjoy üòÉ üçø

[24-Dec-18 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
still needs some more details, i have to reverse engineer exactly how the data is stored, but it explains every key type

[24-Dec-18 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
since KMD inherits all that, it benefits us to have it clearly documented

good day everyone, i'm working on a golang app that makes simple p2pkh transaction for komodo and i use btcsuite library for that.
Can anyone assist please, what is the difference in building a transaction before and after sapling activation?

[26-Dec-18 12:16 PM] alex.zvsk#8956
If anyone can point to related document or general concept.

[26-Dec-18 12:17 PM] jorian#4555
you can follow zcash documentation for that, it doesn't differ from KMD

[26-Dec-18 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@alex.zvsk that's great mate! I can learn from you a bit üòÉ

[26-Dec-18 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what repo?

[26-Dec-18 12:38 PM] alex.zvsk#8956
@grewalsatinder the base code is quite straightforward

@alex.zvsk This might help:

mainly, the difference is versioning and appending nExpiryHeight, valueBalance, and vShieldedSpend

hey @blackjok3r were these sync issues introduced from cryptoconditions or sapling upgrades, or were they around from before then do you know?  nice dabbling into c++ ‚úÖ  and src code exploring

[29-Dec-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Some of both

[29-Dec-18 06:07 AM] Mylo#8306

There was that many of them I forget, most of cc related that didn't show up until very heavy amounts of oracle txs were done, others were there from block 1 million.

[29-Dec-18 06:10 AM] Mylo#8306
cool.   so some kind of stress testing oracles discovered this?

[29-Dec-18 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[29-Dec-18 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Uncovered a few things

Had some blocks on cfek that took over 30s to validate :o

[29-Dec-18 06:12 AM] Mylo#8306
#kmdlabs chains that you test with, they each have different functions?   what do the names stand for?

[29-Dec-18 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At this point in time not really but that is the goal yes

[29-Dec-18 06:12 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah cool, hard to plan the best testing chains - just test everything atm i guess lol

[29-Dec-18 06:13 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks for info, kmdlabs doing it again!

[29-Dec-18 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These chains we have ATM are just still going from testing momom

[29-Dec-18 06:14 AM] Mylo#8306
do you guys have migration running on a timer/cron testing it all out still slowly?

[29-Dec-18 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No right now. We are planning a stress test of it in the cpmig weeks once everyone is avalible. Bad time of year ATM.

anyone know how to fix debian when a manual build/install of python breaks apt-listchanges?

[29-Dec-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no but when arch goes mental, you need to delete every file it complains about... I made a script of the return, using search rplace to add rm infront of each line

[29-Dec-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont delete the entire folder üòâ

[29-Dec-18 10:15 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the problem is that it broke apt and returns `/usr/bin/apt-listchanges: not found` and I'm sitting here looking at the feken file üòï

[29-Dec-18 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
pretty much anything py is borked on here now

[29-Dec-18 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üò¶

[29-Dec-18 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess apt handles it diffrently

[29-Dec-18 10:20 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
well, all I know is that for future reference...
if on debian 9.6 **do not** do:
```wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/Python-3.5.0.tgz
tar xzvf Python-3.5.0.tgz
cd Python-3.5.0
./configure
make
sudo make install```
LOL
