i am working in the tests of SUQA (adding dpow tests) and they recently upgraded to btc 0.17.1, so that is why i am complaining about all this

[03-Feb-19 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems too fresh for good compatibility

Yes new chains only... Was created specifically for labs... But their is no reason a diff ac can't use it if they wanted to

[03-Feb-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This sad it looks like its stalled out with a bug already :(

[03-Feb-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Was known bug tho lol

[03-Feb-19 12:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL our upstream zec is trying to upgrade all their tests to latest btc style, just fyi

so all these changes will probably land on kmd's head

[03-Feb-19 12:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are many api changes that i am finding, changed function names, new required methods which much be over-ridden, changing functions to class methods

[03-Feb-19 12:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, the fun

[03-Feb-19 12:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think somebody just has a fetish for tests at zec (or they all do), so they *want* that, but wow is it a large undertaking

[03-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
We can merge new one and left old one as well I guess

[03-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a separate folders

[03-Feb-19 12:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
all the test infrastructure changed

[03-Feb-19 12:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you would have 2 copies of that, too

[03-Feb-19 12:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
in various different locations, because they changed dir names and all kinds of stuff

[03-Feb-19 12:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is no more `./qa` dir, lol

[03-Feb-19 12:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
`tests/functional` now

[03-Feb-19 12:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
because that is a lot nicer to type

[03-Feb-19 03:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hi guys back again i just have a query that i only need to give premine coin supply with no reward is it possible ?

[03-Feb-19 03:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like i have tried but i am not getting the balance

[03-Feb-19 03:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  my friend 😄

[03-Feb-19 03:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have gone off for a long time

[03-Feb-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[03-Feb-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ac_reward=1 ac-end-1

[03-Feb-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i suggest using labs komodod and VerusHahh11 100 pow

[03-Feb-19 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only need to give premine coin supply with no reward is it possible`
buy dPoW, you'll need it :troll:

👌🏽 

[03-Feb-19 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't make much sense to build a mineable coin on top of a KMD AC and *not* enable dPoW. It's like getting a Rolls Royce without locks or doors

[03-Feb-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
locks only keep honest people honest

[03-Feb-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, then DPoW is like parking your rolls underground in a fortified cave with armed guards, versus leaving it running at the local gas station

[04-Feb-19 09:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  yes i have done the above steps you mentioned but i didnt get using labs komodod and verusHahh11 100 pow?

[04-Feb-19 09:01 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and still unable to get balance its 0

[04-Feb-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you want a chain with no block reward it has a million attack vectors... I made a VerusHash 1.1 chain work with PoS that stops most of these from being possible... ie NH doest work on them, and you need stakers, people who have vested interest keeping the chain alive regardless if there is a mining reward.

[04-Feb-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont care about the chain being able to tbe easily stalled... then jsut use `-ac_end=1`

[04-Feb-19 09:36 AM] niksmac#0421
What could be reason for

[04-Feb-19 09:36 AM] niksmac#0421
`electrumx_rpc -p 10702 getinfo` throwing `error making request: CancelledError()`

[04-Feb-19 09:37 AM] niksmac#0421

[04-Feb-19 10:09 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok thanks

[04-Feb-19 10:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  yes i am using the -ac_end and following the instruction given in the komodo documentation  but the balance is not generated

[04-Feb-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure I follow, you have -ac_supply set but there is no supply being genrated? thats not possible... is the node using -ac_pubkey or -pubkey ? and is that keys private key imported?

[04-Feb-19 10:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i know about the -pubkey ... like i have give the -ac_supply lets say 2 billion that is the total supply as well with no mining reward and i only have one node so when i tried to get info it say 2 billion in premine not in balance

[04-Feb-19 10:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
balance is 0.0000000

[04-Feb-19 10:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
still

[04-Feb-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to check which address it went ot

[04-Feb-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`getblock 1 | jq .tx[0]`

[04-Feb-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then `getrawtransaction <txid> 1`

[04-Feb-19 10:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
no thats is the problem  @blackjok3r  the block is not mined

[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai ill try

[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its not mining any blocks?

[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when i do get info it says zero block

[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yep

[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
my command is

[04-Feb-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure they are connected

[04-Feb-19 10:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
./komodod -ac_name=TESTCOIN -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_end=1 -ac_reward=1 &

[04-Feb-19 10:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this is the command

[04-Feb-19 10:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when i run this command i set set generate true 1

[04-Feb-19 10:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but nothing happens

[04-Feb-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its connected to another node?

[04-Feb-19 10:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have two nodes on the other node i ran the same command with -addnode

[04-Feb-19 10:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and first ip of the node

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
port is open. does getinfo show `connections : 1`

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it shows i connections

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
strange

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ill try again

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and let you know

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
setgneerate true 4 or something... hit it woth more hash rate

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[04-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
