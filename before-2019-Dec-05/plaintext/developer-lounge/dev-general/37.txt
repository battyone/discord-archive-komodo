I guess it is like having a diverse group of people in the same general area. what benefits does that create?

[15-Oct-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
unlike in the bitcoin world where the bitcoin maximalists calls all altcoins as scams (creating a hostile and combative environment), I believe that all KMD based projects can be an asset to the entire ecosystem. Of course, some will revert to the hostile ways and not contribute anything at all, but so far we are seeing the vast majority of projects helping each other out as they can. The spirit of cooperation the KMD ecosystem has is quite a wonderful thing and of course without it, it wouldnt be a thriving ecosystem, but rather a scorched earth battlefield that we see in many parts of crypto

[15-Oct-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
just look at all the tipbot rain that is happening

[15-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Patziggy#9371
That's incredible! Thank you for taking the time to explain this in such a succinct way. It sounds like this approach is maximizing the benefit from comparative advantage and enforces a culture of generalized mutual reciprocity. I've definitely noticed just how positive and cooperative the vast majority of people are in this ecosystem and this information helps to demonstrate why.

we dont have any official guidelines about this, it is just a natural outcome of the tremendous people in the community

[15-Oct-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
even people not directly involved with any specific coin, might one day have an idea, the next day someone else does a test using that idea, then one thing leads to another and we get PIRATE

[15-Oct-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
spontaneous coin creation

[15-Oct-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so while other projects aim to raise lots of money to attempt to solve a single specific problem and then spend months or years maybe solving it or not, KMD likely already has something that can implement whatever the funding was raised for and it just takes a few people with the initiative to pull it all together

[15-Oct-18 05:32 PM] Patziggy#9371
What a wonderful example of spontaneous order! Having observed the Komodo ecosystem for a while now it really seems (from a non-technical perspective) that innovation is ballooning in a seemingly exponential way. 

When you describe these technical advances made by runtime forks as "coming back" and "made available", are certain advances made compulsory for future runtime forks due to their advantageous nature, or does individual runtime fork customizability take precedent?

[15-Oct-18 05:33 PM] Patziggy#9371
I hope my phrasing there is accurate (or at least clear d:). Thanks again for sharing such helpful information üòÑ

[15-Oct-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
at the source code level a runtime fork can become a source code fork

[15-Oct-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
then when the source code is merged back, it can be a runtime fork again

[15-Oct-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
all the non-core GUI also would directly or indirectly apply

[15-Oct-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
open source

[15-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Patziggy#9371
That's fascinating; I feel like I'm always playing catch up with the excellent information you and the rest of the team provide (a good problem to have). Going to take this new knowledge and apply it to future research about the ecosystem! :Komodo: 

Looking forward to contributing in what ways I can \o/

i dont think sapling is active yet

[15-Oct-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
`Verus Coin 0.4.0 includes support for Sapling addresses and transactions, including memory usage reduction of near 98% and performance improvements over previous z-transactions typically 40-50x.`

[15-Oct-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's confusing, because Sapling is not activated yet, but the code is there, I guess you can play with regtest and testnets until it goes active

[15-Oct-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@Patziggy I forgot a very obvious direct benefit!

[15-Oct-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
whenever any runtime fork convinces a user to install agama to run that coin, then the user is able to run all the other coins with the same agama

if I be honest, going back to try learning and practicing core languages like C/C++/Go I feel the exact same things I had when I was graduating.
stuck on some problem and unable to get past that for long.
and less help on the subject.
not talking about C/C++, but I feel stuck on go language's web library with silly things such as routing.

[16-Oct-18 07:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[16-Oct-18 07:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not many help around I found

[16-Oct-18 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the exact same thing I done when I learned node.js at the start. It was smooth as learning once I figured the basic routing and stuff, and able to make SuperMESH in weeks/months.

[16-Oct-18 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
getting stuck at one problem sucks... üò¶

[16-Oct-18 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Im sure after making enough mistakes the rest of it takes care of itself, as long as you have the patience not to rage quit.

@mrwormwood #deleted-channel

[16-Oct-18 10:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder I deal with that stuff too, getting stuck on one problem. Debugging experience is more valuable than knowing any one language or library, imho. James says he spend *half* his time debugging

[16-Oct-18 10:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
clearly identifying the exact bug, breaking it into small bugs, and fix small things until the big thing is fixed, is the general algorithm. But applying it different places takes some creativity + experimentation, like "I know this is crazy and it shouldn't work or do anything but what happens if I do ...." is the real fun/challenge

[16-Oct-18 10:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, work on different things to prevent burnout + frustration, don't bang your head on the same thing for too long if you aren't making progress

[16-Oct-18 10:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
like this `getchaintips` coredump in KMD I am trying to understand, I keep coming back to it with new ideas, after hacking on other stuff

[16-Oct-18 11:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
explaining the problem to somebody else, even your imaginary friend, by writing a detailed document, often makes you think of something new

Sorry this is a bit late, but that's a fantastic point about the Agama wallet! I suppose I'm living proof of that benefit in a way; I initially installed the Agama to store KMD and was surprised by how many additional assets were included. Pleasant surprises are abound in the Komodo ecosystem in my experience üòÉ

AXO is one of the smallest asset chains and it is triggered there

maybe this is a boost bug and we can update boost versions, but other coins don't have this issue.

I need to check if the latest VRSC 0.4.0 works, it's odd to me that VRSC getchaintips worked but KMD + all asset chains + EMC2 + GAME getchaintips does a coredump

[16-Oct-18 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's some kind of clue. VRSC gave me 1GB of out JSON, but still worked, and is extremely similar code to KMD
