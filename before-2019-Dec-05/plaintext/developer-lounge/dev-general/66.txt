to cache the memory

[27-Nov-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but it stopped :/

[27-Nov-18 08:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we used POS splitter

[27-Nov-18 08:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
as well

[27-Nov-18 08:30 AM] gcharang#6833
dPOW is enabled for this chain?

[27-Nov-18 08:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but when i came in the morning the blocks were stopped

[27-Nov-18 08:32 AM] gcharang#6833
If it is a test chain, most probably it doesn't have dPOW. To enable dPOW for a chain all the komodo Notary nodes need to run your chain as well.

[27-Nov-18 08:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the blocks were stopped

[27-Nov-18 08:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we faced a smiliar situation before at that time we didnt use POS splitter

[27-Nov-18 08:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and the blocks were stopped at 5000

[27-Nov-18 08:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but this time we have used POS splitter \

[27-Nov-18 08:33 AM] gcharang#6833
if you do getinfo, is the number of blocks increasing?

[27-Nov-18 08:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
nope

[27-Nov-18 08:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the number of blocks are not increasing

[27-Nov-18 08:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thhough its getting infor

[27-Nov-18 08:35 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't know how you can troubleshoot this. Please wait for either @Alright or @blackjok3r to respond

[27-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to stake with more than 1 daemon ... or its unreliable

[27-Nov-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also MORE UTXO ... make thosands

[27-Nov-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not hundreds of thousands

[27-Nov-18 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we have two staking nodes

[27-Nov-18 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
already

[27-Nov-18 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[27-Nov-18 08:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the blocks are stopped on 20164

[27-Nov-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how many utxos? and are you staking the minign rewards?

[27-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright might be a better person to talk to about this, as in out testing we have many stakers.

[27-Nov-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There has been a few times using just hte 1, that it has failed.

[27-Nov-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also, I have daemons that stake from a single address, but they have thousnads of utxo (or at elast many hundreds)

[27-Nov-18 08:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but right now

[27-Nov-18 08:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have just stopped the daemon and started it again

[27-Nov-18 08:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and its seems to be working :/

[27-Nov-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can you do a `getbalance64` RPC call on each node

[27-Nov-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There can also be a situation, where it can stop wokring due to too many utxo

[27-Nov-18 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never encountered this in my testing and generally just tried to amke as many as possible.

[27-Nov-18 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But Alright had a daemon fail. Are you staking to a -pubkey?

[27-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is this chains 100% PoS ?

[27-Nov-18 09:01 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[27-Nov-18 09:01 AM] D.rabbani#9094
100% POS

[27-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm... my advice is to use multiple daemons and lots of utxo.

[27-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless Alright has a better solution.

[27-Nov-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will be launching our main chain soon, using a 50/50 model, maybe we will find some issues that can be fixed, not sure we ever ran a chain for 20,000 blocks in testing. although MGNX seems to be moving along fine.

[27-Nov-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
MGNX isnt 100% PoS

[27-Nov-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it is good to have at least a little of PoW so you can always mine your way to the next block

[27-Nov-18 10:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Can notaries also perform that function?

[27-Nov-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
if the chain is 100% PoS, there is no PoW

[27-Nov-18 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with enough stakers we didnt have any problems early on.

[27-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and mgnx is reporting 100% pos most of the time due to no one mining it.

[27-Nov-18 10:45 AM] Mylo#8306
anyone got a way to help with a PEBKAC error.   i need a script to run through the last n chars of a priv key to see if it matches an address?  I seem to have not c+p a privkey "all the way"

[27-Nov-18 10:46 AM] Mylo#8306
only 3 chars. so not computationally crazy

[27-Nov-18 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hi there @blackjok3r  again the situation has arised actually the staking nodes are stopiing mining the blocks

[27-Nov-18 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then i run the daemon command again and then set generate true 0

[27-Nov-18 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
then it runs again for a while and stops again

[27-Nov-18 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[27-Nov-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have no idea

[27-Nov-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`komodo-cli -ac_name=chaain getblance64`

[27-Nov-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and also check that it has not locked up, check ram use

[27-Nov-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i have set cron jobs on that ram use

[27-Nov-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i just check the get balance command

[27-Nov-18 11:38 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its showing the splitted balances

[27-Nov-18 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are they all mautre?

[27-Nov-18 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or most of them?

[27-Nov-18 11:38 AM] D.rabbani#9094
most of them

[27-Nov-18 11:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
there is also a digit in immature

[27-Nov-18 11:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
immature has got some figure

[27-Nov-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that does not matter, as long as they are not ALL immature it should be staking blocks.

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
in mature it is :683812990.0638325
immature :467197539.9999

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont know still why it stops making blocks

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
neither do I... I have noticed it on some chains myself but thaught it was due to screwed up wallet

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I suggest

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
any better thning to do ?

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we have use

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
restarting it with -rescan option

[27-Nov-18 11:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
what will it do ?

[27-Nov-18 11:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
what is the command ?

[27-Nov-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actually better still

[27-Nov-18 11:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so what will it do ? and command for that ?

[27-Nov-18 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`komodo-cli -ac_name= stop`
`./komodod <acparams> -zapwallettxes `

[27-Nov-18 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i think thats the correct spelling... it might need to ahve that done periodically... I need to have a think about this, please let me know the outcome of  this.

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
will it affect anything mr @blackjoj

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will just take a few minutes to run

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i put all my params ?

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you are restarting the daemon with an extra argument

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
right staking node one and 2

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all nodes that are not working

[27-Nov-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okau and in the end i just put -zapmwallettxes

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai at the moment the blocks are running fine

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats the right flag if not I need to check source code

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but if it stops

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but it keep stalling ?>

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if so please stop it right now

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i ll carry on with this command

[27-Nov-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and run this command

[27-Nov-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i cant at the moment  but i will

[27-Nov-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and will let you know as well

[27-Nov-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool.. please let me know if that fixes it

[27-Nov-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can you please make sure that it is the exact command ðŸ˜ƒ
