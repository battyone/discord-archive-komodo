[18-Mar-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
turns out its harder than I thaught ... the equihash miner in komodod can only use N values divisible by 8... 
Lucky thr BEAM team has an upgraded miner for values outside this range, almost mnaged to get beam equihash functions to compile into komodod so iut can support basically any number 😃

[18-Mar-19 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So close ... seems need to start again 😦

@blackjok3r ASIC resistance until it's not 😂

[18-Mar-19 09:04 AM] Alright#0419
if it makes financial sense to create an ASIC for a given set of n,k values, someone will

[18-Mar-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its really not as easy as I thaught at all... very easy for N values that divide by 8 but getting BEAM equihash into komodod is liek impossibl;e they seem to use some newer blake cryto library... Got it to compile but cant find any valiud blocks so wasted entire day have to start again 😦

[18-Mar-19 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
so divide by 8

[18-Mar-19 09:05 AM] Alright#0419

[18-Mar-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that doesnt let you use all thes "new" N&K values though

I think I can get it to work, but its a bit messy and building on windows and what not might be a bitch... BEAM also uses newer GCC... so ubuntu16.04 cant even compile it

[18-Mar-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found a block with 150,5 but wow its slow... 1 core took like 3-4mions to find a block at diff of 1.

[18-Mar-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was using the wrong solver in the miner... stupid mistake..

the only question left to ask is:
"why?"

[18-Mar-19 12:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
why not? who knows, might get beam to get some goodies from kmd :troll_cool:

[18-Mar-19 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why not?`
Because one of the beautiful things about komodo is the lack of silly shit
99% of all reasons to change K & N is just silly shit

there might still be some folks that want to be asic resistant for reasons they have, because different ppl & mindsets

[18-Mar-19 12:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
and besides, maybe j0ker's bored and trying new things

[18-Mar-19 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I doubt that there is more than 2 people in this ecosystem that would benefit from a valued assetchain with different K&N values more than me and I still think it's silly

[18-Mar-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe progpow is silly also

[18-Mar-19 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wouldn't go that far; but, on a base level changing RAM requirements is all but pointless

[18-Mar-19 12:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
from my pov, it's best to have options. if someone uses the ac param then i'd say it served its' purpose

[18-Mar-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
apparently it also needs new solvers as the existing one only supported multiples of 8

[18-Mar-19 12:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
if it's integrated and not used there's no harm (which would probably lead to removing it), but if it's used it's a plus. right?

[18-Mar-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as a platform, our job is to provide as many things for projects to be able to use/tune/tweak

[18-Mar-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810

`apparently it also needs new solvers as the existing one only supported multiples of 8`
It's been quite a while since I looked into that bit, but wouldn't that just require adding the steps? Obviously can't be done with closed source miners, but there are open options, no?

[18-Mar-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i asked for progpow support, but i guess n/k support was an intermediate step and if it just helps us test multi-algo then it served its purpose

[18-Mar-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The design goal of ProgPoW is to have the algorithm’s requirements match what is available on commodity GPUs`
Weren't you the one arguing right along side of me last year agreeing that defining to hardware was mostly counter-productive and when hardware changes people should adapt? 🤔

[18-Mar-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[18-Mar-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what changed? did I miss something?

[18-Mar-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing changed. its just an -ac option

[18-Mar-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i made ac_blocktime too, but doesnt mean blocktimes will change from one minute

[18-Mar-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
as a platform it isnt for us to limit things, but to allow people to do what they want, and many people want progpow

[18-Mar-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`as a platform it isnt for us to limit things`
To that end I agree, I'm just having a mental block as to how adding literally limiting features fits within that

[18-Mar-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockhash algo is a very small part of the overall picture, what does it matter what it is?

[18-Mar-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
its like if my favorite color was pink, and I am making a paint program, i wouldnt limit all the colors to being shades of pink

[18-Mar-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
even if i didnt like some color, i would still have it available

[18-Mar-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true, but to that end (imo) it's akin to adding a switch that allows someone to push out a version of your paint program that only allows users to paint in "hot pink"
and someone else to push a version that only allows "electric blue"
with just one arg

[18-Mar-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if someone wanted to do that, let them

besides, I'm still waiting for @blackjok3r to fix verushash for CHIPS, not dinking around with K&N for assets 😛

[18-Mar-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already got all K and N values working, the problem is that you need to define it in the code... so we cant actauly add them all. Mostly did this first because it was easier and, I can learn about how the block hash parts work... before trying to add a new one.

[18-Mar-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So I will take dukes list of common K and N values and put those in.

[18-Mar-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the problem is that you need to define it in the code.`
Can't you just take out the constants? Or at least define them and set them later in the if?

[18-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried that and simply no

[18-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The solver makes heavy use of C++ templates ... and it would probably be so slow it would take days fo find a block if I had to re write all that

[18-Mar-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and well OI dont know how to 😄

[18-Mar-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If the dipshits at the coin which shall not be mentioned can change the const of KN twice in 1 year, I have faith that you can figure out how to make it a var

[18-Mar-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not much to add common ones, there are already a few in the code., that are unused...  I've just ported some BEAM code over, that allows you to use the default solver with N values that didnt work before like BEAM and AION (?) use

[18-Mar-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Before only N values divisible by 8 worked, now they all work, but the Tromp solver does not work with them so daemon mining is very slow.

[18-Mar-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to amke it a var man, and its not possible 😦

[18-Mar-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"add progPOW to komodod` .... "re-writes the equihash solver" 
Dooesnt seem like the job I was aked to do lol

[18-Mar-19 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so daemon mining is very slow.`
That comes with the territory, it's the same reason that GPU hashrate is cut by like 90% going from 200,9 to the lemming numbers

[18-Mar-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, by adding comon ones GPU miners exist... doubtful daemon mining would ever be used for any chains that used this option

[18-Mar-19 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but isn't "GPU only" the goal of folks that like those numbers anyway?

[18-Mar-19 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if so, then it seems to me that you did it right

[18-Mar-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, and I know a helll of a lot more about how the hashing stuff works now. So adding more hashing algos will be pretty easy. 😃

[18-Mar-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
/*
* Equihash 200,9 (KMD/Zcash)
* Equihash 150,5 (beam)
* Equihash 144,5 (SnowGem)
* Equihash 96,5 (Minex)
* Equihash 210,9 (Aion) */

[18-Mar-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we have these ones does anyone know of any others I should add?

[18-Mar-19 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
144,5 is the "lemming" one (the one that had a whole following switch to), right?

[18-Mar-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah snowgem is using that one, they got it from someone else. Duke supplied that list.. by removing the unused ones I only had to add one more than was already there

[18-Mar-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trying this 210,9 one atm... like 1GB of ram for a single thread 😆

[18-Mar-19 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's one or 2 that are like insanely high usage, iirc

[18-Mar-19 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its just the default solver .. its liek 100x maybe more slower than tromp. So testing this is pretty time consuming. I'm pretty sure its good though now. Not a lot of code changed in the end to add them all in.

This was my progress today, if you can see anything I should ahev done better/safer/differnetly let me know. 
It works with the list you supplied and without any param supplied (that took a fair while lol) 
I'm aware it doesnt change magic/port yet. Its easier to test it without that. 😃

[18-Mar-19 04:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ive tested 200/9 ( although not syncing any existing chains) 
150/5 and 210/9 seem to work  but mining is extremely slow

[18-Mar-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, that is expected

[18-Mar-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
impressive that equihash now supports values where n is not a multiple of 8, nice work!

[18-Mar-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have one small question

[18-Mar-19 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
why did you remove (48,5) ? I think that is used for regtest

[18-Mar-19 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ported BEAM code, might ahve wasted a lit too long on  it but I learnt a fair bit of C++ today
