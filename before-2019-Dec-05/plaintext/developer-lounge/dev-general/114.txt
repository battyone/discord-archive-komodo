The issue here is that the temp file is using up the same space as the blockhain, until you restart it, now this isn't much of an issue if you restart it every few days... But of you left every daemon up for weeks or months the disk is using 2x the space when it doesn't need to...

Notary operators should use an actual server... Not rented ones... Then this iabt problem...

[31-Jan-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When it prunes the tempfile it already checks if there are blocks in it... When I broke it and it removed tempfile that had valid blocks in it.. It just redownloaded them... No issues.

[31-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I so t see the problem with clearing the temp file in Run time... It seems lime we defiantly should be doing this, it just depends how exactly... The reason for the fix is to not fill disk space and ram with pointers to and invalid blocks.

[31-Jan-19 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the rental service you and I use has sizes up to 800GB, so I'm not sure what you mean by `literally cannot offer enough space`

[31-Jan-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
60 chains (KMD included) is less than 30G

[31-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If it is saving them anyway with this fix... Until u restart so it doesn't actually fix it...
We were told 1tb bit some operators seem only have 500gb... I have 1.5tb on mine as find it still too small... Need 8tb ssds to come out :3040_kingpeepo:

[31-Jan-19 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I have 1.5tb on mine as find it still too small...`
I'm lost about something as to how you're running up that much space, so I'll go back to lurking

[31-Jan-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bitcoin full node and 3 kmd full nodes lol

[31-Jan-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Actually 4 kmd nodes I this k maybe 6 even

[31-Jan-19 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, 12 years from now a NN would need 2TB...

[31-Jan-19 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The point is, if someone attacks a pos chain with this attack even with a temp file it will start taking out notary nodes by filling their disks until the restart... That seems like it solved nothing

[31-Jan-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
as opposed to permanently having the spam blocks

[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt exactly easy to make spam blocks

[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a cron that if synced del temp?

[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is not any direct financial gain

[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We don't even have a working attack to test these fixed against which makes creating a fix speculation really

[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a way to detect if a tmp file has no inuse blocks and then purging it would work

[31-Jan-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can do this already

[31-Jan-19 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But... That said without an attack I'm flying blind

[31-Jan-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, if it is safe and stable, that is the way to go

[31-Jan-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
just knowing that the only permanent blocks are valid ones, that alone is sufficient to know the attack is blocked as we can see the .blk file usage

[31-Jan-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I can make the miner just mine blocks that have something in them that cannot pass connect block.. Like a tx containing some data

[31-Jan-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Rather than make the actual attack just simulate it for this

[31-Jan-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
your node will get banned soon enough, but maybe can get some blocks into the tmp files

[31-Jan-19 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking to disable banning

[31-Jan-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although I'm not sure that this attack is that possible as you would need thousands of IPs

[31-Jan-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To actually do it

[31-Jan-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it is difficult, but not impossible to do and without direct financial gain it has been blown out of proportion to its importance. still since we are close to a catchall solution, that is good

[31-Jan-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes its a good solution... Just need some way to stimulate the attack to make sure it works as expected

[31-Jan-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a special case call ProcessBlock 1000x and ensure it goes into the tmp file

[31-Jan-19 12:22 PM] cipi#4502
@niksmac since KMD and all assetchains use the same parameters (at least the important ones) you could use `COIN = Komodo` for your assetchain, but i recommend making a new entry. Then you could also make changes specific to your AC. Take a look at this: https://github.com/cipig/electrumx/blob/kmdassets/electrumx/lib/coins.py#L1509
I can add your AC if you wish. How should it be called (NAME)? You must then use this NAME in your config. This is my config for Chainzilla (/etc/electrumx_ZILLA.conf):
```COIN = ChainZilla
DB_DIRECTORY = /electrumdb/ZILLA
DAEMON_URL = http://eleczilla:mKr4zbI27Umzilla@127.0.0.1:10041/
RPC_HOST = 127.0.0.1
RPC_PORT = 8028
HOST =
TCP_PORT = 10028
EVENT_LOOP_POLICY = uvloop
PEER_DISCOVERY = self```

Hi
I am technical blockchain adviser and solution architect
I am thinking of creating own blockchain using Komado for one of my client
Can someone connect me with tech team
thanks

[31-Jan-19 02:34 PM] niksmac#0421
thanks @cipi

[31-Jan-19 04:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@linuxchip you can ask questions directly in this channel

[31-Jan-19 04:13 PM] linuxchip#2621
OK @dukeleto

[31-Jan-19 04:13 PM] linuxchip#2621
Is any Komado based token listed in normal crypto exchanges ?

[31-Jan-19 04:13 PM] linuxchip#2621
Any examples

[31-Jan-19 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@linuxchip do you mean a cc token or an assetchain?

[31-Jan-19 04:15 PM] linuxchip#2621
suppose i created a new blockchain on Komado

[31-Jan-19 04:16 PM] linuxchip#2621
After that on that custom blockchain, i created one utility token

[31-Jan-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@linuxchip VRSC, ARRR, OOT are on various exchanges

[31-Jan-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't really track which asset chains are on which exchanges, tho

[31-Jan-19 04:16 PM] linuxchip#2621
oh

[31-Jan-19 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't know of any cc tokens (what it reads like you're describing), so I don't know of any on exchange
but as duke pointed out, there are several assetchains on exchanges

[31-Jan-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
what are we talking about?

[31-Jan-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, BTCH is a KMD assetchain, but doesn't have cryptoconditions enabled, yet. ARRR has I believe enabled cyptoconditions. Both are on at least 1 exchange

[31-Jan-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
ARRR is being listed on cryptobridge, as well as VRSC, currently

[31-Jan-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC has cryptoconditions

[31-Jan-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
every asset chain can choose the -ac params they want

[31-Jan-19 04:18 PM] linuxchip#2621
My client requirement is to create ERC20 type token on Komado based new blockchain

[31-Jan-19 04:19 PM] linuxchip#2621
And then he has to list that token in Binance etc

[31-Jan-19 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
"erc20 type token" doesn't mean much

[31-Jan-19 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
komodo AC's can be mineable, or not, and many other tweaks to how coinbase work

i mean fixed supply token and then he want to sell that token to raise funds

[31-Jan-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto what he's describing sounds to me as a fungible cc based token that's a "sub" of an assetchain (not an assetchain itself)

[31-Jan-19 04:20 PM] linuxchip#2621
Yes correct @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[31-Jan-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to the best of my knowledge no one has done that so far (I'm not sure if it's even in/out of beta yet)

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] linuxchip#2621
oh ok

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmm

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that is supported in cryptoconditions tokens/assets API

[31-Jan-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
so any current AC with cryptoconditions enabled could in theory do that stuff, they have the tech, but haven't utilized it yet. The code was just recently written and many coins have not yet updated to it, if they want it

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I know KMD LABS is doing stuff related to that

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
they have a channel #kmdlabs

[31-Jan-19 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I thought I read james talking about it, but I wasn't sure what branch it was in

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] linuxchip#2621
So for present how are your clients using Komado platform

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] linuxchip#2621
TO create new blockchain and apps

[31-Jan-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
many clients use it in many ways

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are many channels starting with #cc-* that relate to cryptoconditions

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
some people are working on GUIs, some are working on really low level new CC's

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
such as the "Heir CC"

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`TO create new blockchain` most simply use the base daemon/cli because it only takes 1 line to create a chain

[31-Jan-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a new project that is a Sudoku game bolted onto a blockchain, Komodoku

[31-Jan-19 04:26 PM] linuxchip#2621
I am trying to understand the use cases of komado

[31-Jan-19 04:26 PM] linuxchip#2621
so that in future if any client requirement matches i can refer

[31-Jan-19 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
Protecting against 51% attacks, via delayed-Proof-of-Work, is something that various other coins employ KMD to help with

[31-Jan-19 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
other clients create new blockchains with KMD, some mineable, some not

[31-Jan-19 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
I beleive that KSB/OUR is doing things related to your erc20 interests

[31-Jan-19 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think KSB is the "mother chain" and OUR is a token inside of that

[31-Jan-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
no exchanges support trading of assets CC tokens (yet), but plenty support assetchains directly, as they are a normal blockchain coin

[31-Jan-19 04:28 PM] linuxchip#2621
ok

[31-Jan-19 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
KSB/OUR is in the #0pay channel, except the 0 is a weird unicode one I can't figure out how to type

[31-Jan-19 04:29 PM] linuxchip#2621
I think i have to understand better before telling to client

[31-Jan-19 04:29 PM] linuxchip#2621
But many thanks for your time @dukeleto  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[31-Jan-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i think KSB is the "mother chain" and OUR is a token inside of that`
OUR is a PoS/PoW full chain

[31-Jan-19 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD has a lot going on, and many many third party clients using it in novel ways

[31-Jan-19 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
KSB contacted me about making their own tokens on their chain, I guess. Many people are interested in new CC stuff, not many chains have had time to upgrade to it

[31-Jan-19 10:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@linuxchip the usecase you described in this line is simplest of Komodo:
>i mean fixed supply token and then he want to sell that token to raise funds
- On ETH if one project needs raising funds they use smart contract ERC20 to create tokens "on top of ETH blockchain", which is dependent on ETH and also subject to any network issues whichever ETH gets in present and future. However it has been widely used, hyped and liked due to their somewhat easiness (I'm not exactly sure if it is actually easy... just heard).
- On Komodo Platform if a project needs raising funds, and wants to have some cryptocurrency, tokens to sell to it's user/client base they instead create their very own blockchain, called Assetchains, and these assetchains has wide variety of options to chose to create all kinds of different economic governed blockchain. For more detailed options please take a look at this link: 
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html

Once a project finalized on what assetchains parameters they will use and created their blockchain, they can utilise the Atomic Swaps technology to sell those tokens in an absolute decentralized manner as well as to the wider interoperability options in industry which in my opinion no other project does in industry. You can get some idea by how many different cryptocurrency tokens they can sell tokens to, which I think covers like 90%+ cryptocurrencies in industry.

[31-Jan-19 10:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
With ETH it would have mostly just been ETH at first since it being only the ETH on chain token, and if they needed to trade it with BTC or external cryptocurrency, it most probably had to go through some semi-centralized or centralized gateway.

Did I mention Assetchains are absolutely independent blockchains? like Litecoin or Zcash is to Bitcoin. Such independence gives better governance of own blockchain in creating all sort of custom solutions a project wants to.

Crypto-Conditions are not actually equivalent technology to ETH's Smart Contract. Crypto-Conditions (CC) are different and goes far beyond the capabilities what Smart Contracts offers, as with CC a developer can create Core Blockchain Consensus level code with much efficient, ease, security.
Please read through the docs and developer resources to get started, and if you have any questions on Komodo Platform architecture and it's design decisions or anything just ask here. We have many developers and knowledgeable community members around to answer all such questions.

[31-Jan-19 10:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are also some white-labele projects which a project can use for their wallets and selling tokens in a Decentralized ICO way.

[31-Jan-19 10:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If your project comes to that level, or has any enquiry, you can contact @ca333 or our marketing team like @Audo @Steve Lee

[31-Jan-19 10:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are some companies as well who are helping clients just like you say. Chainmakers: @siu - Chainmakers and @jorian, Chainzilla: @PTYX
