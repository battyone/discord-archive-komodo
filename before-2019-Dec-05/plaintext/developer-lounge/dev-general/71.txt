[28-Nov-18 08:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this is what ihave used

[28-Nov-18 08:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i think its the final master branch

[28-Nov-18 08:09 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but @blackjok3r  the zapwallettxes trick has worked i guess

[28-Nov-18 08:09 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because what i did yesterday

[28-Nov-18 08:09 AM] D.rabbani#9094
was zapwallettxes on both staking nodes

[28-Nov-18 08:09 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but today i did it on the main  node only in the morning

[28-Nov-18 08:09 AM] D.rabbani#9094
till now seems to be working fine

[28-Nov-18 08:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
lets see how it goes

[28-Nov-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so your on mastrer branch... then your issue might not be the same as what we have.

[28-Nov-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem fort you is most likley because youir staking and sending txs

[28-Nov-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stop staking before sending txs, or use s diff node I htink

[28-Nov-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and yes, might peridocally need to zapwallettxs

[28-Nov-18 08:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
till now it hasnt stopped

[28-Nov-18 08:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yesterday when i did it it stopped in 15 minutes

[28-Nov-18 08:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
every time

[28-Nov-18 08:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i did

[28-Nov-18 08:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its been 45 minutes till now it hasnt stopped

ðŸ‘Œ 

[28-Nov-18 08:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can you tell me further about the utxos

[28-Nov-18 08:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and all that please @blackjok3r because i need to get to the depth of it

[28-Nov-18 08:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
if you can just give a brief

[28-Nov-18 08:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
what were you on about utxos unspent transactions and how it affected my node

[28-Nov-18 08:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i shal be verythankful to you for that

[28-Nov-18 08:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i guess thats the problem is because i was sending transactions from staking  node 1 now i will use staking node 2

[28-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its best to send the utxos to the node that will be staking and just let it stake

[28-Nov-18 08:27 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai  i just need to know about that utxos things if there is some documentation or other stuff ?

[28-Nov-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure where that documentation is.. maybe goodle it... im quite busy atm..

[28-Nov-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
utxos are BTC protocol stuff

[28-Nov-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there should be plenty of info out ther

[28-Nov-18 08:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks man

[28-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also having huge amounts is probably not an issue

[28-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am staking with 4 chains on a single VM with 8 vCPU (very old ones at that) and 5000+ utxo no worries... its fine

[28-Nov-18 08:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai maine thing is CORES it matters alot

[28-Nov-18 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you should have:
number of daemons +1

[28-Nov-18 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for core count

[28-Nov-18 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 5 daemons and 3 extra "free" cores

[28-Nov-18 08:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
well at the moment i only got 1 core cpu

[28-Nov-18 08:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and i am only running

[28-Nov-18 08:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
example coin daemon on it

[28-Nov-18 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using 2 core migh help .... but I am finding that the wallet.dat is gettign corrupted on staking nodes

[28-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this means that after a certain amount of time

[28-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to do zapwallet

[28-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and rescan...

[28-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is ok on short chains

[28-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but as they get very long this will be a massive iussue....

[28-Nov-18 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
my boss was asking about the splitting of further addresses

[28-Nov-18 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and said why do we need to split everytime

[28-Nov-18 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and what does it mean by 10K transactions cant be handle on one core  server

[28-Nov-18 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
10kUTXOs

[28-Nov-18 08:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i had no answer for that

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
for splitting into further 64 addresses

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then transfering the remaining balance on each of them

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to split to 10,000 utxo

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
just make sure there are more than a few hundred

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
a utxo is just an unspent output

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
sendtoaddress 100

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
makes a utxo of 100

[28-Nov-18 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[28-Nov-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
each block needs to be staked by a specific utxo

[28-Nov-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if there are not utxo, you cant stake

[28-Nov-18 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but mr @jl777c  in my case

[28-Nov-18 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
why i need to look at the server again and again and i need to restart the daemon

[28-Nov-18 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when i do that it works fine for sometime

[28-Nov-18 08:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and after that it starts giving error on both staking nodes

[28-Nov-18 08:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
invalid block mined try again

[28-Nov-18 08:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and it goes on with a long list

[28-Nov-18 08:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i think only two cores is the solution

[28-Nov-18 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a PoS network running on two nodes is not really as it is designed. you need more than 2 nodes for a reliable network, especially with 100% PoS. maybe 90% PoW is better as you can always PoW a block if things get stuck

[28-Nov-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
on a system with limited resources, if you have a lot of utxo, it could run out of resources

[28-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so i need 4 nodes atleast ?

[28-Nov-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
during mining/staking creating invalid blocks happens. what is important is if eventually a valid block is created by some node

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai sir

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it has stopped again

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ðŸ˜¦

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
unfortunately

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
is the chain actually totally stuck, or is it just printing out invalid block errors, yet still eventually finding blocks

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its printing out invalid blocks

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
again and again

[28-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
on both the staking nodes

[28-Nov-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if that printout wasnt there is the chain still advancing?

[28-Nov-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
what about the getbalance64, does it show eligible funds?

[28-Nov-18 08:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[28-Nov-18 08:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
wait

[28-Nov-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the chain is advancing?

[28-Nov-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, what is the problem?

[28-Nov-18 08:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like the blocks have stopped building mr @jl777c

[28-Nov-18 08:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its not advancing

[28-Nov-18 08:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
for example

[28-Nov-18 08:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
if invalid block mined is 30694 its stuck on it

[28-Nov-18 08:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
180707390

[28-Nov-18 08:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
mature :180707390

[28-Nov-18 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for how long is it stuck?

[28-Nov-18 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
immature :970323765

[28-Nov-18 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
for about 10 minutes time

[28-Nov-18 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
now

[28-Nov-18 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when ill restart the daemon it works fine

[28-Nov-18 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, it does seem like there is a bug with 100% PoS chains
