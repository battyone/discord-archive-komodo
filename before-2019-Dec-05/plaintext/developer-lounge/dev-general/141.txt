Can you walk us through what a practical example of this betting and dispute resolution looks like?

[22-Mar-19 05:39 PM] zack#6467
if a fork happens, then each side has it's own version of the truth.

[22-Mar-19 05:39 PM] MyName#0491
OK, I'm entirely lost now
Komodo is a "scam" because it's "not trustless"
but Amoveo is "trustless" because you trust that only someone with pure motives would spend money for you to manually decide what is/isn't a "lie"?

[22-Mar-19 05:39 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
hold up. what is a side? miner, better, oracle or investor?

[22-Mar-19 05:39 PM] zack#6467
they don't need pure motives, just greed.
Since they will double their money

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is majority rule

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so this is a trust in greed thing?

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] zack#6467
if the oracle causes the blockchain to fork, the result of the oracle is the only thing different on each side of the fork

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
what if the majority is lying to gain

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] zack#6467
no, there is no majority rule.

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
majority bets

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] zack#6467
Even if you have >50% of the money, you can't force the outcome

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] MyName#0491
you're missing my point, by that claim alone, Amoveo is a "false advertisement" "scam" as well (because I can buy the ability to determine the outcome)

[22-Mar-19 05:40 PM] zack#6467
we have a full week to see what you are doing, and to do a hard update to make you lose all your money

[22-Mar-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
well it isnt an automated system then

[22-Mar-19 05:41 PM] zack#6467
we will do an update to prevent that oracle from being able to close on a lying outcome.

`Even if you have >50% of the money, you can't force the outcome`
You literally said earlier that I can pay you to determine what's a "lie" and what isn't

[22-Mar-19 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
Seems to me your largest volume exchange can dictate what is and isn't true

[22-Mar-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so an ambiguously worded fact would create all sorts of problems

[22-Mar-19 05:41 PM] zack#6467
in the nash equilibrium it is automated. this is the extreme case where someone spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to test the limits

[22-Mar-19 05:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
kind of a Randian basis for consensus. but with a central authority to overrule if required?

[22-Mar-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but what prevents a majority of money to back the lie?

[22-Mar-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the manual threat of hardfork?

[22-Mar-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so all oracles must be 100% unambiguous in their statements

[22-Mar-19 05:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The trustlessness of Amoveo seems to be "false advertising" :troll:

[22-Mar-19 05:43 PM] zack#6467
the lying outcome will eventually get blocked anyway, and then they will lose the 51% of money that they dumped into the oracle.

[22-Mar-19 05:43 PM] MyName#0491
` this is the extreme case where someone spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to test the limits`
If I'm betting a million, what's 20% to get you to force it my way?

[22-Mar-19 05:43 PM] Alright#0419
"Hard update" is centralized and yet you're upset over the naming of our oracles cc on the basis it is centralized

[22-Mar-19 05:43 PM] zack#6467
each github account is centralized, but anyone can host a version of Amoveo's source code

[22-Mar-19 05:44 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is there any profit in making a `Barney the Dinosaur` oracle which just asks the same question over and over with the same undeniable answer?

[22-Mar-19 05:44 PM] MyName#0491
anyone can host a version of Komodo's source code

[22-Mar-19 05:44 PM] MyName#0491
_has 6_

[22-Mar-19 05:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i host about 4 or 5 too

[22-Mar-19 05:44 PM] zack#6467
it costs a fee to make an oracle, but is is very cheap. Like $1.50
So go ahead with your dinosaur questions

[22-Mar-19 05:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it would be cheaper in a komodo assetchain üòÇ

[22-Mar-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and if someone posts a lie, then 75 cents can win the $1.50?

[22-Mar-19 05:45 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what does the oracle earn per question?

[22-Mar-19 05:45 PM] zack#6467
I think it isn't so important if a question is ambiguous.
If you don't like a question, you can ask another one.
Since there is no obligation to participate as an oracle reporter, I think it will follow the spirit of the question instead of the literal words.

[22-Mar-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC at scale is a data market where good providers get subscribers and bad ones dont. more designed for data streams than for single event data points

[22-Mar-19 05:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cant trust spirits

[22-Mar-19 05:46 PM] MyName#0491
@zack You're still not addressing the fact that in your own words someone can influence the outcome of your trusted setup by throwing money at it and you'll manipulate the outcome

[22-Mar-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and low low cost

[22-Mar-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you get paid to post data

[22-Mar-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont pay to post the data with oracles CC

[22-Mar-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
a subscriber subscribes and that is the monetary force to keep the publisher providing good data

[22-Mar-19 05:47 PM] zack#6467
yes, reputation can help make data feeds more reliable. 
But there is the problem of retirement attacks.

And you will have a trade-off where the lower the trading fee is for a data feed, the higher the likelyhood of a retirement attack.
This makes it expensive.

[22-Mar-19 05:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
i like the name fo that attack

[22-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no trading fee for data, you get paid to publish, it is a totally different model

[22-Mar-19 05:48 PM] zack#6467
As a developer it is my duty to write whatever versions of software the mining pools are interested in running.

[22-Mar-19 05:48 PM] MyName#0491
"expensive" and "trustless" are not synonyms

[22-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
hard to achieve trustless when it isnt expensive

[22-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but the cost can be in reputation, doesnt have to be money

[22-Mar-19 05:48 PM] zack#6467
if there is a tradeoff between cost and security, then it is not trustless.
Trustless means a mathematical proof that it is impossible for anyone to steal your money.

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so its the oracle operator that can retirement attack? Barny might go extinct if he's not fed enough.

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is no money at stake here

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also it seems that Amoveo only works in a context of data used for betting

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but what about sicentific data?

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
people are not betting with the oracle CC data

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
climate data collected?

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
outputs from a device

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] MyName#0491
`As a developer it is my duty to write whatever versions of software the mining pools are interested in running.`
As a miner, investor, and pool-op, I have to say that seems about backwards to me

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
Dog data

[22-Mar-19 05:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
trustless has limits

biological data from a implant in a cow?

[22-Mar-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean they could but that requires adding a trustless layer, which is definitely possible based on what you are saying

[22-Mar-19 05:51 PM] zack#6467
A typical oracle mechanism is tens of thousands of lines of code.
A trusted feed is not even 1% of the way to a secure oracle.

[22-Mar-19 05:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
crypto is full of mathematical proofs, yet people get scammed or hacked often. there is always a trust layer beyond the chain

[22-Mar-19 05:52 PM] MyName#0491
`A typical oracle mechanism is...`
Does such a thing actually exist?

[22-Mar-19 05:52 PM] zack#6467
http://139.59.144.76:8070/new_oracle.html
You can ask the oracle questions from the browser light node. it syncs headers to provide cryptoeconomic security.

[22-Mar-19 05:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
of course... Amoveo

[22-Mar-19 05:52 PM] zack#6467
bitcoin hivemind, Augur, Amoveo, Gnosis, there are a few now

[22-Mar-19 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
All of this over the naming? You realize you're only going to convince someone to implement this on komodo by coming here, right?

[22-Mar-19 05:53 PM] zack#6467
I am happy to share knowledge with anyone who wants to learn

[22-Mar-19 05:53 PM] PTYX#6840
At least we all learned a few things

[22-Mar-19 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
Ayyy you're in the right place :)

[22-Mar-19 05:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
until data hits chain, it is vunerable. This includes oracle records and private keys entered into browsers, or wallets that use google spellcheck

where is this 10k+ lines of code for amoveo?

[22-Mar-19 05:54 PM] zack#6467
the light node supports cold storage for payments. 
I should add cold storage for asking the oracle questions. that would be a good feature.

[22-Mar-19 05:54 PM] zack#6467
The oracle is a lot smaller in Amoveo than the others

[22-Mar-19 05:54 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still curious though, what is the profit model for being an oracle, and what are its liabilities for misbehaving?

[22-Mar-19 05:55 PM] MyName#0491
`bitcoin hivemind, Augur, Amoveo, Gnosis, there are a few now`
Doesn't Gnosis state that oracles can be centralized?

and what if nobody is paying attention?

[22-Mar-19 05:57 PM] zack#6467
miners and mining pools do need to stay a little aware. in the incredibly unlikely event that a fork will happen, then mining pools will have at least 1 week to update their nodes, and miners will have a week to switch to a pool that has updated.

[22-Mar-19 05:57 PM] zack#6467
if no one is paying attention, then the result of the oracle doesn't matter

[22-Mar-19 05:58 PM] MyName#0491
`In some cases, there simply is a single source of truth‚Ää‚Äîe.g. a sensor measurement by a specific sensor, or data on who won the Nobel prize for medicine from a prespecified newsfeed. If those data are available in a structured format, only a signature of the issuer is necessary to make them smart contract compatible. This is what we call a centralized oracle.`
Literally quoted from what you listed as a `typical oracle mechanism`, but came here calling a "false advertisement" "scam"

[22-Mar-19 05:58 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if the oracle lies on the chain but noone pays attention did it really lie?

[22-Mar-19 05:58 PM] zack#6467
the vast majority of bets will be settled before the oracle resolves, because the participants in the channel will want to get their money out sooner.

[22-Mar-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the Toracle requires there to be enough funds at stake, like outcome of an event
