So I get the pubkey, then restart the daemon with pubkey option? And then all funds will stay in one address?

[07-Jun-19 10:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@allbits yes get pubkey and restart the daemon with it, then no change addresses
but you can explicitly do: `getnewaddress`
and `sendtoaddress` to that address

[07-Jun-19 10:12 PM] allbits#5898
Understood. Thanks

[07-Jun-19 10:12 PM] allbits#5898
Good point by the way @hyperDEX

[07-Jun-19 10:21 PM] allbits#5898
How do I get balances by address

[07-Jun-19 10:22 PM] gcharang#6833

[07-Jun-19 10:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
./komodo-cli listaddressgroupings

[07-Jun-19 10:24 PM] allbits#5898
listaddressgroupings is good

And there I see, for example, that my interest went into an address that I did not back up the privkey for

[07-Jun-19 10:26 PM] CHMEX#0686
now that you started the daemon with your pubkey you can sweep everything to your backedupaddress

[07-Jun-19 10:26 PM] CHMEX#0686
./komodo-cli sendtoaddress ADDRESS "" "" true

[07-Jun-19 10:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
there is also e -donation parameter in case you want to send all rewards to one specific address
docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/common-runtime-parameters.html#donation

[07-Jun-19 10:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
might be interesting if you fund your childers further college education with rewards

[07-Jun-19 10:31 PM] allbits#5898
K thanks

[07-Jun-19 10:33 PM] gcharang#6833
`listreceivedbyaddress` lists balances by receiving address.
this one is useful too

[07-Jun-19 10:34 PM] allbits#5898
Thank you guys

[07-Jun-19 10:39 PM] allbits#5898
When I restart the daemon is it expected behavior to stay on "loading block index" for a while?

[07-Jun-19 10:51 PM] gcharang#6833
yes

[07-Jun-19 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
does anyone know if Komodo 0.3.3b-2 beta release works for ZEXO?

[07-Jun-19 11:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ it works

[07-Jun-19 11:02 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
sweet, tnks; need to walk someone through a send and all he has is mac and not much experience

[07-Jun-19 11:04 PM] gcharang#6833
I just did that 4 times yestarday üò∞

[07-Jun-19 11:11 PM] allbits#5898
Can someone walk me through the sendtoaddress call to sweep everything to my backed up address?

[07-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Varshini#4460

i have submit an assignment on sunday. any inputs would be helpful

[07-Jun-19 11:20 PM] Varshini#4460
on mac

[07-Jun-19 11:21 PM] gcharang#6833
@Varshini do you need to compile from source or just the daemon is enough for your purpose?

[07-Jun-19 11:21 PM] Varshini#4460
i builded on mac , beta branch .

[07-Jun-19 11:22 PM] gcharang#6833
do you just need to use the komodo software, or you need to build by yourself?

[07-Jun-19 11:23 PM] Varshini#4460
i need to build by myself. I am doing a college project.

[07-Jun-19 11:23 PM] gcharang#6833
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/beta-multios-0.3.3b-2/komodo_beta_OSX_v6_10_12.tar.gz
this gives you `komodod` and `komodo-cli` 
not the most upto date but they work

[07-Jun-19 11:26 PM] Varshini#4460
can you provide more information, where should i use `komodod ` and  `komodo-cli`

[07-Jun-19 11:36 PM] gcharang#6833
`./komodod` 
starts the komodo daemon
`./komodo-cli help`
in another terminal gives a list of all the avilable commands

`komodo-cli sendtoaddress Rsome_address $(komodo-cli getbalance) "" "" true`

[07-Jun-19 11:43 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
other than `Rsome_address`, all of that is literal

[07-Jun-19 11:45 PM] gcharang#6833
@Varshini check DM

[08-Jun-19 12:31 AM] allbits#5898
Thank you Mr genie. That worked.

[08-Jun-19 12:33 AM] allbits#5898
It also has the effect the collecting further accrued interest, right?

[08-Jun-19 03:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Using this in LABs, you could tweak it for just KMD and set to run periodically.
@allbits - https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/sweep_funds.py
set address variable near top, and reserve amount to keep in local wallet.

how to add test funds to a user  ?

[08-Jun-19 04:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Varshini is it a custom chain you;ve launched?

[08-Jun-19 05:02 AM] Varshini#4460
yes

[08-Jun-19 05:03 AM] Varshini#4460
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator i launched custom chain

[08-Jun-19 05:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
use this command in CLI `komodo-cli -ac_name=YOURCHAINNAME setgenerate true 1`

[08-Jun-19 05:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that will mine the genesis block on the node it is run from.

[08-Jun-19 05:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
have you got 2 nodes running, with p2p ports open?

[08-Jun-19 05:18 AM] Varshini#4460
nope, i have single node

[08-Jun-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
set `-testnode=1`

[08-Jun-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to use 1 daemon for tes5ting params.

[08-Jun-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It allows mining without any poeers

[08-Jun-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the chain is actaully right reluanch without that parameter

[08-Jun-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and sync another daemon

[08-Jun-19 05:20 AM] Varshini#4460
i executed these command earlier 
```./komodod -ac_name=TEST1 -ac_supply=777777 -ac_reward=50000 -testnode=1```

same address & wif.

[08-Jun-19 10:55 AM] Mylo#8306
the random generator in KVM seems to have been not so random

[08-Jun-19 10:55 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe this is how walletgenerator . net has done what it's done, virtual machine clones running on host ?

[08-Jun-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
/dev/urandom always returning 0x00 would to that

[08-Jun-19 11:02 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks i'll look into it

[08-Jun-19 11:29 AM] Mylo#8306
`od -d /dev/random` seemed to output lots of numbers.

[08-Jun-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo you cloned the exact entropy of the same machine 4 times

[08-Jun-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
all the saved entropy

[08-Jun-19 12:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
cat /dev/random > /dev/null for a while to throw away entropy

[08-Jun-19 12:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's usually regenerated with network activity, keyboard and mouse, other random stuff. You didn't give the machine enough time to generate it's own entropy, all the machines basically had the same

[08-Jun-19 12:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
power cycling the VM should help the entropy as well

[08-Jun-19 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
this kind of thing happens a lot, I have seen people complain about a similar error when test suites are supposed to do things in random order, or use a random seed, or something like that, but they don't, because the test suite VM was cloned and doesn't have it's own entropy

@jl777c if you just need a quick hack ILN gui wallet, i can give you that. If it's for average users, not sure

[09-Jun-19 04:00 AM] dukeleto#7326

[09-Jun-19 06:28 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or how to clean it up

[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
honestly, 9mb is fine, you ll get improved performance if the utxo fb is flushed but in case utxos are not mature and pending to be added on balance, they will disappear, not sure if same with staking but that s how it works
