I talked with James, and yes, there are some current issues, but maybe they can be worked around. txindex is only needed by KMD

[05-Sep-19 02:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
not any asset chain

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's for interest calcs

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
watchonly addrs could be used for dpow in pruned mode

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really do not think it can, I am pretty falmiliar with the pruneing code

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
why do you need to prune ACs?

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
so txindex will be off

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
dpow would be disabled entirely, no?

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
poretty much...

[05-Sep-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
not sure how pruning works, but if it just flat out ignores OP_RETURNs, dpow is deded

[05-Sep-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
what I am saying, is pruning might be compatible with DPoW *if* we can leverage nSPV

[05-Sep-19 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
GetTransaction wouldnt work without txindex... and if the blocks are pruned... there are no tx to look up

[05-Sep-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r listen to my words (take a huge bong rip, might help)

[05-Sep-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
we can change the code, and make it work for ARRR

[05-Sep-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
but not KMD

[05-Sep-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
because interest

[05-Sep-19 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nSPV is good, but it needs to be 100% reliuable to use in consensus code

[05-Sep-19 02:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r very good point

[05-Sep-19 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if a node replies garbage

[05-Sep-19 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then nodes that receive that, could fork.

[05-Sep-19 02:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r James seemed to think it might be possible for stuff not KMD, because in that case, it's a hard no

[05-Sep-19 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fetching from lots of nodes. isnt really practival, as it will overlaod all full nodes very fast

[05-Sep-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
make nodes that fetch from nodes that fetch from nodes

[05-Sep-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
problem solved

[05-Sep-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
we only need 1 real node

[05-Sep-19 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nSPVs that send each other getinfo calls?

[05-Sep-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
man I'm joking 😫

[05-Sep-19 02:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
we originally talked about this in ARRR captains quarters, about using `-prune` with ARRR

[05-Sep-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
there is *no reason* to prune ARRR

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
the only stuff it would prune is notarizations

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's actually viable, a bit. If you change over to watchonly and don't use txindex to find dpow xtns

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
and obviously you don't want to do that

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actually you could keep the notarization check points and prune the blocks

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
so, IF pruned mode => use watchonly instead of txindex to find dpow xtns

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the blocks are there when it is validated

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
too slow

[05-Sep-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
ok, again, why?

[05-Sep-19 02:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
allow a full ARRR node to run in `-pruned` mode with dpow

[05-Sep-19 02:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
that was wanted by CG

[05-Sep-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont side track me :abusedsmily:

[05-Sep-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r go to sleep

{Reactions}
😂 

[05-Sep-19 02:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
it works fine right now, but the node itself doesn't know about dpow. All it can do is relay

[05-Sep-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what? it 10am

[05-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r man, i am still dealing with corrupt block indexes even with your SER_DISK fix. I think I am still missing the proper use of SER_DISK, giving it to a certain function somewhere?

[05-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe it's defaulting to no SER_DISK because I am not passing that variable in somewhere

[05-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
your fix was also needed, deciding whether to READWRITE it

[05-Sep-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
in the meantime, i write docs to not get too frustrated

[05-Sep-19 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
SER_DISK, Y U HATE ME?

[05-Sep-19 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
assertions that corrupt block indexes really suck

[05-Sep-19 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
demoralizing to know i need to wipe and fully sync again to test it

[05-Sep-19 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Food for thought:
As I wander through github, I'm constantly amazed at how much IP the Free Software Foundation, Inc. owns

[05-Sep-19 05:40 PM] allbits#5898
Can you expand on that? I'm genuinely interested

[05-Sep-19 06:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Can anyone from these teams quickly add their coin to the newly to be released Heat Mobil wallet? SHould be easy and fast to add your coin to the wallet. https://github.com/Heat-Ledger-Ltd/heat-modules

_is so glad that he has most of the channels that @DLT Novice is spamming muted_

[05-Sep-19 08:29 PM] DLT Novice#2835
DOnt hate me so fast

[05-Sep-19 08:29 PM] DLT Novice#2835
I asked @jl777c first

[05-Sep-19 08:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure he realized that your intention was to copy/paste 2 full screen in 187 million channels

[05-Sep-19 08:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😕

[06-Sep-19 01:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
@DLT Novice i see it's all NodeJS. No thanks, HUSH wants no part in that

[06-Sep-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i just realized mike-fucking-tout wrote the assertion line that has been giving me problems for days. I don't have enough things to throw

[06-Sep-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
Mike's ChainPower code is utter garbage

[06-Sep-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a disease infecting my PoW code

[06-Sep-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
causes fucking constant problems

[06-Sep-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User merged into KMD

[06-Sep-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
and breaks everything constantly

[06-Sep-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
he changed so much internals

[06-Sep-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
every time you try to merge stuff from ZEC or current KMD, it's mike's garbage hour

[06-Sep-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
His garbage PoS code causes bugs in PoW coins

[06-Sep-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
no documentation or comment about WHY THE FUCK THIS ASSERTION EXISTS. Just because Mike felt like adding it.

Fuck your shitty code, Mike

[06-Sep-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
Your MSFT values are not welcome in this community.

[06-Sep-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, broken VRSC code is merged into KMD, accidentally

[06-Sep-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, it happens

[06-Sep-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
All. The. Time.

[06-Sep-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User he is not improving my "things"

[06-Sep-19 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
he only causes me work

[06-Sep-19 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
with his shite code

[06-Sep-19 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
That fucking backdoor was accidentally merged

[06-Sep-19 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
Don't even get me started.

[06-Sep-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
Corrupt block indexes make devs unhappy

[06-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Been debugging this a week, and yeah, I am salty af

[06-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
need to do a fresh sync every time I try different code

[06-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
I thought I was bumping into BTC internals I didn't understand

[06-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
So I went deep, took out my pen and notebook and took fucking notes on everything about the code

[06-Sep-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
Now I come to find out it's 💩 Mike recently added, not BTC core or KMD core code

[06-Sep-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
he removed fucking `pindex->nHeight` @Deleted User

[06-Sep-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you know how much fucking busy work this causes for integrating code?

[06-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
every line of code in the universe that uses that needs to be changed

[06-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i have no relationship to him. He has to deal with my code and I have to deal with his

[06-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
He pulls in my code from BTC + ZEC + KMD, and I pull in his code from KMD

[06-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC refuses to use my dpowconfs code and leaves itself open to bugs related to that

[06-Sep-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
Nah, K64 has that covered

[06-Sep-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't get paid enough to have a relationship with miketout, other than the current one

[06-Sep-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
whatevs, semantics
