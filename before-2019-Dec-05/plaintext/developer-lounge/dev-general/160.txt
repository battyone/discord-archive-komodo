Awesome!

[04-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Just 1 question, is KMD language agnostic? So people can code with any language they are comfortable with?

[04-Apr-19 08:53 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Oh nice, any idea when? Also is KMD the only platform that is close to it?

[04-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Sounds great, is that some new project? can´t find it on CMC

[04-Apr-19 08:55 PM] gcharang#6833
In the KMD ecosystem, as a general rule,
Source code (Blockchain): C, C++
GUI: javascript
quick proof of Concept, scripts: Python

there are efforts to create modules in languages other than C

coming from experience I say there is no other language better than C to get grasp on programming fundamentals.

[04-Apr-19 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This course is the first in the specialization Introduction to Programming in C, but its lessons extend to any language you might want to learn.`
man, I love that
I hated that all 4 unis I went to taught js unless you picked a later specialization for a higher degree

It's easy, it is simple, it is the most important starting point.

[04-Apr-19 09:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if the starting is good, you'll never face the kind of hurdles you might face without fundamentals clearer.

[04-Apr-19 09:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
once the basics are clear, with C, just start exploring any other languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python.

[04-Apr-19 09:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
See which one you like

[04-Apr-19 09:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
by the time you ends your fundamentals lessons with C, it'd be pretty clear which kind of programming you want to do

[04-Apr-19 09:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just go with that choice and excel in that

[04-Apr-19 09:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and don't leave C behind. You'll regret leaving it.

[04-Apr-19 09:32 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Thanks for the advice! @grewalsatinder

[04-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Sounds like a good way to start

@grewalsatinder i have Unix Network Programming in hardcover from the 90's, it is considered the bible of unix network coding in C

[05-Apr-19 12:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you want to write low level network applications in TCP/UDP and use raw sockets and understand select() and poll() and friends, that is the book.

(also nice to see Camelia, the Perl 6 mascot, as that github user avatar. Notice that each wing is a "P" and a "6")

I worked on Perl 6 stuff for a long time and wrote large chunks of the the test suite and virtual machine it used originally

@jl777c this Sapling ZIP is very interesting, there will be a new transaction format v5 that disables sprout outputs at the transaction level: https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/357c23f4ee380a1c350f6c94b1d5a31dd15d29ba/drafts/zip-daira-disable-sprout-outputs.rst

```
The removal of ephemeralKey and encCiphertexts fields means that for JoinSplit descriptions in v5 transactions, it is not necessary for a wallet to perform trial decryption of those fields to detect incoming payments as described in [4] sections 4.18 and 4.16.2. The processing of nullifiers in the algorithm of section 4.18 is unaffected.
```

[05-Apr-19 08:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
and ```
Removing the ephemeralKey and encCiphertexts fields reduces the size of a JoinSplit description in a v5 transaction from 1698 bytes to 464 bytes, and avoids the need to scan those fields for incoming payments.
```

[05-Apr-19 08:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
JoinSplits being 25% of the size, and greatly improving incoming payment wallet algo seem pretty interesting, but I am not sure what this means for KMD, since we disabled Sprout in a different way

[05-Apr-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
"The Sapling and Sprout shielded protocols employ different cryptographic designs. Since an adversary could potentially exploit any vulnerability in either design, supporting both presents additional risk over supporting only the newer Sapling protocol."
my assessment exactly

[05-Apr-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
they are disabling sending sprout, so they are taking the long slow path to deprecate it

[05-Apr-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
how can they ever get rid of taddr, no idea

is there a simple way to calc locked utxos balance without iterating over the output of `listlockunspent` with `getrawtransaction`?

[06-Apr-19 07:11 AM] Alright#0419
basically trying to get balance that is not locked in the simplest way possible

[06-Apr-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
get teh total balance and tally the unlocked balance and subtract it I think

[06-Apr-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
listunspent and getbalance

[06-Apr-19 08:21 AM] Alright#0419
listunspent will hide locked utxos?

[06-Apr-19 08:21 AM] Alright#0419
is that what you're saying?

[06-Apr-19 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[06-Apr-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
sum (listunspent) i think with the right flags, maybe default

[06-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
```
>>> 0.00015000 * 100000000
14999.999999999998
>>> 0.00015 / 0.00000001
14999.999999999998
```
What is the proper way to do this in python? Really thought I was well past floating point errors 😫

[06-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
answer should be 15000

[06-Apr-19 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
use satoshis and powers?

[06-Apr-19 10:54 AM] Alright#0419
I have coin values, I'm trying to go to sats

[06-Apr-19 10:54 AM] Alright#0419
so I can do exactly that

[06-Apr-19 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pad it and use negative powers?

[06-Apr-19 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what you mean

[06-Apr-19 10:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright never use FP for financial math

[06-Apr-19 10:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
always do everything in satoshis

[06-Apr-19 10:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
only render as FP with 8 decimal digits

[06-Apr-19 10:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
my hush_supply script does that

[06-Apr-19 10:57 AM] Alright#0419
Yes my problem right now is that I can't get to sats with the data I have

[06-Apr-19 10:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
you must

[06-Apr-19 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure what the py equivalent is to bash `scale` or js `toFixed`, but that's what you need
make sure you have 8 decimal places, and then move the decimal with negative powers

[06-Apr-19 10:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
what is the data incoming format?

[06-Apr-19 10:58 AM] Alright#0419
who's trying to add valueSats to listunspent? 😁

[06-Apr-19 10:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright you just need to understand python basics a bit more

[06-Apr-19 10:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
tell me what data you have and what you actually want

[06-Apr-19 10:59 AM] Alright#0419
I understand how to do math in sats

[06-Apr-19 10:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
i know you do :abusedsmily:

[06-Apr-19 10:59 AM] Alright#0419
I understand that I need to do it all in sats then final step convert to coins

[06-Apr-19 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
but I have coins value, I need to *go to* sats in this case

[06-Apr-19 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
listunspent output

[06-Apr-19 11:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
you just need to know how to do it Pythonicly, right?

[06-Apr-19 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what is the py equivalent is to bash scale or js toFixed?

[06-Apr-19 11:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
satValue = int(value*100_000_000)

[06-Apr-19 11:01 AM] Alright#0419

[06-Apr-19 11:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
probably, I don't do the above ever, but yeah

[06-Apr-19 11:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
rounding

[06-Apr-19 11:01 AM] Alright#0419
forget it, I'll get the values some other way

[06-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
just going to slow down what I'm doing quite a bit

[06-Apr-19 11:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_asks for the 3rd time_
why not use powers?
