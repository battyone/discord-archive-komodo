it takes the latest tx as a base and erases every older utxo from db. no funds are lost, but hidden

[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
in the case you mine to a pubkey I think you can be golden and save maintenance time

[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
im not using publey with the pos64staker

[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
is it better to set one?

[09-Jun-19 06:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
personally I stake on multiple base address but all is redirected to main one via pubkey

[09-Jun-19 06:32 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so even setting pubkey, it wont stake to that 1 address, itll still split to the 64 addresses right?

[09-Jun-19 06:32 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Was just worried if i set pubkey it would mess up the staker 😛

[09-Jun-19 06:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
thr cleanwallettransactions needs to base itself on a tx so classic use is : send balance to self then call cleanwallettransactions with the fresh tx hash

[09-Jun-19 06:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Blackjoker created it and is more competent than me to answer about the mature funds disappearing thing

[09-Jun-19 06:34 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I may just leave it if 9mb isnt too bad haha! Dont want to go through everything again. Do you recommend setting pubkey

[09-Jun-19 06:34 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or doesnt make much difference

[09-Jun-19 06:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
just don t cron it faster than your coin matures

[09-Jun-19 06:34 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
(I dont even know what it does tbh sorry 😅 )

[09-Jun-19 06:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
to me 9mb is fine

[09-Jun-19 06:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
fyi a full resync on my node took 48h approx and 2gbwallet size

[09-Jun-19 06:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
9mb is nothing

[09-Jun-19 06:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
the pubkey adding on the daemon launch will force the mined coin go to that address

[09-Jun-19 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
a sec plz, I just have to find my pizza address on explorer to show you

[09-Jun-19 06:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
if not set, it will send to one of the 64 addresses either way correct? (Whichever is currently least efficient)

[09-Jun-19 06:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
no worries. Also if you can dm me for 10 seconds to discuss what size utxo youd recommend for my balance, id be more than happy to send some of the extra coins your way 😄 Dont think my utxos are efficient at all

[09-Jun-19 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
look at mined funds

[09-Jun-19 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
this is because of daemon with pub

[09-Jun-19 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
not using it creates a new address affiliated with mined fund iirc

[09-Jun-19 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
or maybe on existing one, sorry am tired

[09-Jun-19 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
(and I think I m wrong on the last statement)

[09-Jun-19 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
tech gurus on kmdlabs will explain that better than me :)

[09-Jun-19 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
just don t cleanwallettransactions without full understanding what it will do

[09-Jun-19 06:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
for utxos the smartest guy is Genie

[09-Jun-19 06:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
I just use a triple layered utxo to round robin but not sure it s the best way (90% 9% 1%)

[09-Jun-19 06:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
as long as you dont run `cleanwallettransactions` while you have a pending transaction, it should be fine. Otherwise you might need to resync to see your funds again.

[09-Jun-19 07:20 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
while this problem of dependencies get resolved at a fundamental level,  a possible intermediate solution is an easy method of offline signing. Your keys never touch the internet ever. I've been talking w Airgap for integration of Komodo + reward claim + assetchain and will proceed with it. It would be even better to have this natively available for Agama or the future wallet : https://airgap.it/
You only need an old smartphone with app for creating, holding and signing w your seed and a qr code reader, never connect it.
1.Use the online wallet to create a raw transaction, show qr code
2.Read qr code with offline smartphone, sign it and show qr code of signed tx
3.Online wallet imports the signed tx via qr code & cam
4.Send tx

AirGap - Your old smartphone is your new 'hardware wallet'
With the AirGap two device approach secure key handling becomes more accessible. The AirGap Vault is installed on a dedicated or old smartphone that has no connection to any network, thus is air gapped. The AirGap Wallet is installed on a every-day smartphone.

@KomodoWorld  This is just a great idea !!! Multifunctional cold storage !!! Another way would be to implement encryption for the container of this wallet in the smartphone's memory - so that it would be impossible to read the information without a private key by retrieving it physically for analysis! Something like Veracrypt for a wallet!

😎 👍 

[09-Jun-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
even though I like veracrypt, I have lost data due to unable to put correct passphrase for encrypted volume.

[09-Jun-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
stupid memory, and too many passphrase.

[09-Jun-19 10:25 AM] RK#9320
@jl777c can any type of virus or malacious software access to wallet dat file

[09-Jun-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on the specifics of the virus/malicious software

Then how to protect my gems

[09-Jun-19 10:28 AM] RK#9320
I mean arrr

[09-Jun-19 10:28 AM] RK#9320
🤔

[09-Jun-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
dont let virus or malicious software run on your computer

[09-Jun-19 10:29 AM] RK#9320
If by visiting any Website it catches

[09-Jun-19 10:29 AM] RK#9320
Or by running any patch

[09-Jun-19 10:29 AM] RK#9320
Any Antivirus

[09-Jun-19 10:29 AM] RK#9320
Can protect

[09-Jun-19 10:30 AM] RK#9320
I use quick heal pro

[09-Jun-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is best to not run any thing else on the node that has crypto in it

[09-Jun-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why hardware wallets are more secure, at least one of the reasons as you dont run the browser on a hardware wallet

[09-Jun-19 10:30 AM] RK#9320
@jl777c nodes you mean folder

[09-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
no, the computer that has your wallet

[09-Jun-19 10:31 AM] RK#9320
Oh my god when hardware wallet support for ARRR

[09-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a dedicated laptop just for crypto and nothing else

[09-Jun-19 10:31 AM] RK#9320
@jl777c can I encrypt wallet data file

[09-Jun-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want maximum safety, get a totally dedicated computer (laptop) for your crypto. there is the piratechest nodl i see in progress. something like that

You can... but it’s an Asic coin , so probably won’t get much

2 years was just a thought I pulled out of my head, I didn't think it was *that* bad until I did the numbers 😛

[09-Jun-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
