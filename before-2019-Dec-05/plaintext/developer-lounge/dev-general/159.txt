@grewalsatinder explain your problem to me, a dummy that doesn't understand Go

[28-Mar-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
this must be why I hear people say "don't write web apps in Go"

what are some methods of getting data from multiple sources and choosing just one?

[29-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
is there libraries that exist for this, e.g. 
datasources[ src1, src2, src3, src4 ];
getData.usingMethodFirstToRespond(datasources);
getData.usingMethodFilteredByJurisdiction(datasources, filter);

Does such a toolkit exist, don't care what programming language.  Likely perl has something if i were to place a bet.

[29-Mar-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810

Lately I've seen some attention for this paper, it's very much over my head but I post here for reference

https://rainbownet.work/RainbowNetwork.pdf

`This paper presents the Rainbow Network,  a design for an off-chain non-custodial exchange and payment network supporting any liquid asset. The Rainbow Network allows a user to trade, lend, borrow, send, and receive any liquid asset, entirely off-chain, while having only one on-chain payment channel collateralized by a single asset. The network is composed of Rainbow channels, a  variant of payment channels where settlement balances are computed based on the current prices of other assets. This paper presents two constructions of Rainbow channels:  one where the parties to each channel agree on a price oracle, and a more limited versionthat does not require a trusted price oracle. The latter construction can be implemented on top of any bidirectional payment channel, such as the Bitcoin payment channels used in the Lightning Network`

[30-Mar-19 03:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mylo  I would use the `grep` Perl builtin to filter out things from an array, like ` grep { is_correct_jurisdiction($_) } @datasources` üòÉ

I started out doing things the Right Way, @grewalsatinder, using conditionals to tell if its building on/for x86 or not, but kept failing at that in one way or another, as I am not a C/C++ diety like jl777 or MikeT, so I punted to scraping out the AES optimzed VerusHash code, which is what was giving it fits (or rather, the building of it, its still in the branch)
