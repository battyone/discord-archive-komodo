[10-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
those are the enabled CCs

[10-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
changing CCs changes consensus

[10-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
so it can only be done at mandatory updates

[10-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it's dangerous

[10-Sep-19 01:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
adding new CCs is not so dangerous as changing an existing CC

calling a chain "KMD" will not activate KMD specific stuff, must not set -ac_name at all

[10-Sep-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright ah, ok. it requires patching the code a bit too üëç

[10-Sep-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
emulating KMD interest is non-trivial except on mainnet, it seems?

[10-Sep-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
interest is the source of some of the most fiddly consensus bugs, too

Thank you for the advices

[11-Sep-19 12:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c is it accurate to say that
```
The default p2p and rpc ports of a Smart Chain are solely dependant on the `-ac_` parameters and values used to launch it.
```
?

[11-Sep-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[11-Sep-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is a good way to put it

[11-Sep-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang the current code does not default adaptivepow to be enabled for new chains, it seems better to require a specific -ac_adaptivepow=1 in the ac params

[11-Sep-19 09:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
that keeps the same exact KMD chain creation command  backward compatible as well, meaning the same exact thing even in the future üëç

@jl777c  a chain that has `-ac_adaptivepow=1` in launch parameters will have APoW and a chain that doesn't include the param `ac_adaptivepow` will have the normal PoW. `-ac_adaptivepow=-1` is meaningless and invalid.
is that correct?

[12-Sep-19 06:08 AM] redp1ll#3268
Hi guys, as I understand the selection of Antara modules has to be defined at the initiation of a Smart Chain. Does that mean that a hard-fork is always necessary when intending to add modules that will be developed along the way?

[12-Sep-19 06:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@redp1ll in most cases adding a new Antara module doesn't need a hardfork
modifying an existing Antara module will definitely need a hardfork

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12-Sep-19 06:14 AM] redp1ll#3268
@gcharang ok I see, so in case I want to change the tokens module for example, there would be the option of cloning the existing module and modifying it as needed to avoid a hard fork?

[12-Sep-19 06:16 AM] gcharang#6833
```
change the tokens module
```
depending on what changes you are doing, it will need a hardfork

[12-Sep-19 06:18 AM] redp1ll#3268
well I wouldn`t be changing the module itself but the copy of it and add it to the chain as a new  module (tokens 2.0).

[12-Sep-19 06:21 AM] gcharang#6833
even then if you want the new module to modify/interact with tokens created using the old module, it will cause a hardfork depending on the specifics

to avoid a hardfork tokensv2.0 shouldn't interact with the old tokens

[12-Sep-19 06:22 AM] redp1ll#3268
Got it, thanks for the explanation!

[12-Sep-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang correct. i will probably make -1 an illegal parameter for adaptivepow

[12-Sep-19 06:40 AM] gcharang#6833
got it

[12-Sep-19 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang @redp1ll pretty sure that adding a new Antara module is also a hardfork/mandatory update. It's a change to consensus rules

[12-Sep-19 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
You can sometimes add a new Antara module and not cause a consensus change, but if somebody made a transaction with the new Antara module, older code without that would diverge into a different history. The chain would fork

[12-Sep-19 10:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
if none of those happen, things would be fine

https://kmdlabs.com has a framework for updating Antara modules nicely, if you think you will be doing that a lot

that's what is needed but won't happen

which is why I say, consider HIP400 also KIP400

why wont it happen?

just fork HIP400, and you have KIP400 üòâ

@jl777c yeah, it's not making me feel good. I think it's from a previous very hard crash

or that what we need to do is ignore PR for a year?

usually PR that make sense are merged in without a one year waiting period

I have probably merged dozens of dukes PR without forcing him to go through complex process, was that a mistake?

i should force him to make some official request first? and then approve the PR?

i am in no position to give my opinion on that

[12-Sep-19 02:17 PM] jorian#4555

[12-Sep-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[12-Sep-19 02:17 PM] jorian#4555
i do think that code + documentation is always better than just code, so i encourage KIPs

[12-Sep-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
do you feel that i would try to stop any KIP process?

[12-Sep-19 02:18 PM] jorian#4555
no

[12-Sep-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
do you know of any time that i wouldnt accept a good improvement?

_plays devil's advocate and asks:_
Wouldn't we first need  KIP repo to make a PR to?

[12-Sep-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure the details. if that is what is needed, or if a KIP folder can be created in the komodo repo, these are small details

[12-Sep-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
and if somebody wanted to create a KIP process, i am certainly not against it

[12-Sep-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so not sure why the sentiment is that it will never happen

[12-Sep-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you mean that you dont expect anybody to ever do this, even though nothing stops them from doing it?

[12-Sep-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[12-Sep-19 02:23 PM] jorian#4555
again, i'm not in the position to do this since i'm not developing to the komodo codebase, but i encourage KIPs

[12-Sep-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt there some industry accepted way of doing (X)IP? can we just clone something and start with that?

[12-Sep-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
@Slyris you seem pretty up to date with git and organizational things. can you take care of this
