I have been running checkpointing master nodes in the past

[20-Oct-18 12:17 AM] Alice#9607
@Deleted User thanks! I have to look into the cost

[20-Oct-18 12:18 AM] Alice#9607
I am running all my projects from amazon aws

[20-Oct-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
i used to use AWS and then got a $400 bandwidth bill one month

[20-Oct-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
some NN's run on tiny tiny hardware/VMs, correct

[20-Oct-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
those people have crazy custom scripts to make up for the lack of beefiness

[20-Oct-18 12:19 AM] Alice#9607
if you run the small servers it is fine costwise

[20-Oct-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
so you can have beefy servers and be a bit lazier, but you can run it on smaller servers too.

[20-Oct-18 12:20 AM] Alice#9607
performance on aws is very good with their credit system

[20-Oct-18 12:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
wallet.dat sizes are very important, for instance

[20-Oct-18 12:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Both our Meshbits notary nodes are on AWS servers

[20-Oct-18 12:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto @Alice

[20-Oct-18 12:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
the people who constantly reset their wallet.dat to minimum size have the bests stats

{Reactions}
💯 

[20-Oct-18 12:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
and we have 40+ wallet.dats

[20-Oct-18 12:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
we use a physical OVH server, 8 core box

[20-Oct-18 12:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i think BTC's wallet.dat matters to, other AC's might not

[20-Oct-18 12:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
not sure about external coins like hush/emc2

[20-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Alice#9607
do I need a BTC wallet on the notary node?

[20-Oct-18 12:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[20-Oct-18 12:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I pay around 2000nzd each month for our notary nodes

[20-Oct-18 12:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Aprox

[20-Oct-18 12:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Sometimes more

[20-Oct-18 12:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder i have no idea what 1 NZD is worth 😃

[20-Oct-18 12:23 AM] Alice#9607
1318 usd

[20-Oct-18 12:23 AM] Alice#9607
thats quite a bit

[20-Oct-18 12:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is a lot of moniez

[20-Oct-18 12:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes the problem is if I switch IP to another server there can be other problems

[20-Oct-18 12:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
150 EUR/month, paid yearly

[20-Oct-18 12:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So kinda stuck with first choice

[20-Oct-18 12:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It was idea of @ns408

[20-Oct-18 12:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice there are various pieces of code that Notary Nodes could really use ported from recent BTC to KMD, if you are into that kind of thing

[20-Oct-18 12:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
He convinced me to go with AWS

[20-Oct-18 12:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wished to have a collocation physical server of our own

[20-Oct-18 12:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
we could desperately use the new load/unload/create/delete wallets at run-time stuff, from latest BTC Core

[20-Oct-18 12:26 AM] Alice#9607
@dukeleto time constrained as well

[20-Oct-18 12:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
it would make running a notary node like, so much easier

[20-Oct-18 12:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice alas, time is the most valuable asset, even more than blockspace 😃

💯 

[20-Oct-18 12:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The most important is the notarisation count

[20-Oct-18 12:27 AM] Alice#9607
there could be a single server, or two that are shared by all notary nodes. how about that?

[20-Oct-18 12:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Even with so much automation and hours spent our count sucks

[20-Oct-18 12:27 AM] Alice#9607
to run BTC

[20-Oct-18 12:27 AM] Alice#9607
wallet

[20-Oct-18 12:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The. Best AWS servers beaten by 300 bucks servers

[20-Oct-18 12:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice globally distributed around the world is part of the design

[20-Oct-18 12:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice you have to take out 52 notary nodes to stop notarizations from happening

[20-Oct-18 12:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Single server or data centre is centralisation

[20-Oct-18 12:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
13 are required to come together and agree on block hash data, to create the xtn

[20-Oct-18 12:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Data centre/server can be taken down/blocked

[20-Oct-18 12:29 AM] Alice#9607
@Deleted User thanks! I work in academia, so I am covered.

[20-Oct-18 12:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User I like money

[20-Oct-18 12:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
sudo steady income, plz

[20-Oct-18 12:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
I live by the coinbase, die by the coinbase

[20-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alice#9607
still some nodes could share resources

[20-Oct-18 12:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
security over performance

[20-Oct-18 12:31 AM] Alice#9607
@dukeleto true

[20-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Alice#9607
to what extend?

[20-Oct-18 12:35 AM] Alice#9607
dont know

[20-Oct-18 12:36 AM] Alice#9607
another question

[20-Oct-18 12:36 AM] Alice#9607
are the coins hit by flash mining? how is this handled

[20-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Alice#9607
I red somewhere that the community shares hash power

[20-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alice#9607
are there pure pow coins in the notary node

[20-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alice#9607
lol

[20-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alice#9607
ok

[20-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Alice#9607
thanks guys! I will look into the notary node stuff

[20-Oct-18 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Good night 💤

[20-Oct-18 09:17 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
could someone clarify what is the difference between agama wallet, barterdex and hyperdex, is it same entities or not?
ask because I could see balance in Agama, but not in hyperdex

[20-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Nabob#5004
@Nick Bk (YAF.fy) Make sure you are using same seed on hyperdex, because all products share same code base for resolving address.
Can you check address generated on both agama lite and hyperdex is same ?

[20-Oct-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Even with differing code-bases, the x encryption of y always returns the same z; or else none of what we do would work

[20-Oct-18 01:57 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
my fault, seems ok
but can I use exodus multi wallet seed in hyperdex?

[20-Oct-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Does anyone have a link to how to build a wallet in CentOS?

[20-Oct-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
packages seem to be quite different and I'm lost

[20-Oct-18 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 not sure what TZ you are in, but you will want a stiff drink, and maybe bum a "cigarrette" from Elon Musk

[20-Oct-18 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you can see a centos builder in the Zcash ci system here: http://ci.z.cash/#/builders

[20-Oct-18 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
in general, Zcash source code does not build on CentOS without sacrificing a part of yourself

latest libsnark is completely crazy and new, with rust stuff, not sure if that stuff is packaged well on centos/etc

[20-Oct-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto I'm beginning to realize what a shitshow it is, but I already paid for a year, so I'm stuck with it 😦

[20-Oct-18 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tnks for links, will check it out

[20-Oct-18 11:46 PM] Alice#9607
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 dont waste your time with an outdated os like centos. Use ubuntu by default.

[21-Oct-18 12:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alice It wasn't by total choice - I made the mistake of going through godaddy and it was the only cpanel option they had
good news is that it'll be good enough to run the web and stratum stuff and I can run the wallets on another server

[21-Oct-18 12:03 AM] Alice#9607
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Check out amazon aws. I have been using aws for many years. You can rent a small server for 10 USD per month capable of running wallets, pools, websites, etc.

[21-Oct-18 12:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I'll likely switch to aws next year
It was just one of those things where I had a discount and already had a business account, so it was worth a try
now I know better for next time

[21-Oct-18 12:06 AM] Alice#9607
I see

[21-Oct-18 02:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hey @radix42 is the arm64 compile changes pushed to official Komodo repo?

[21-Oct-18 02:39 AM] radix42#3743
Not yet, I have been tied up with Sapling bs and have both kids until tomorrow, then I can push a PR

[21-Oct-18 02:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok, thanks for quick reply mate. 🙂🙏🏼

[21-Oct-18 02:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hope u having good weekend

[21-Oct-18 02:42 AM] radix42#3743
Thx

[21-Oct-18 05:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think sapling code will come from verus, and once it's pushed to komodo, then radix will finish the arm64 work? 🤔

[21-Oct-18 05:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@radix42 I think it's good idea to wait until sapling is done with komodo, in case you think it'll make you do things again to get arm64 working again. 🤔

[21-Oct-18 05:18 AM] radix42#3743
That is a good idea

RavenCoin has implemented the worst 51% attack prevention to date, and said KMD was incompatible with their "decentralized nature", so I couldn't resist: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1054002122583269376

@KomodoWorld @tronblack they mention $KMD and say: "Problem: Incompatible with the decentralized nature of Ravencoin and requires payment." They don't seem to value the security of $RVN because https://t.co/06whf3FlzI is the most half-assed 51% protection I have seen to da...

so the "protection" is that the 51% attacker cant get 56 blocks ahead?

[21-Oct-18 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
60 confirmations is their 51% attack prevention

[21-Oct-18 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
because a miner has never shown a re-org that big 😹
