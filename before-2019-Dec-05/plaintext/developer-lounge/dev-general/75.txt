but a staking reward can also stake!

[29-Nov-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
without specific details of the block, I cannot give any specific answers

[29-Nov-18 09:50 AM] kmdstudent#8905
Hi everyone, could you anyone let me know kmd `testnet` block explorer link?

[29-Nov-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no active KMD testnet. people just launch a test chain if a test chain is needed

[29-Nov-18 11:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
mr @jl777c  are you there

[29-Nov-18 11:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because i just had a chat with my boss

[29-Nov-18 11:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and he said setting cron jobs wont be a good idea

[29-Nov-18 11:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i need to share the daemon command with you

[29-Nov-18 11:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
if i can share it with you so you can check what is the problem and meanwhile i can stop the cron job

[29-Nov-18 11:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
from there

[29-Nov-18 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[29-Nov-18 12:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can i share it in your personal ?

[29-Nov-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[29-Nov-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and plz send me the funds so I can test

I wrote a small Javascript library for validating cryptocoin addresses across many coins: https://github.com/leto/address-validator

test suite runs in browser: http://duke.leto.net/address-validator/

[29-Nov-18 04:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is for an ongoing KMD project, and seemed like a useful library to write. Anybody that needs to validate many different addresses from various coins in JS, it might make your life easier/better

[29-Nov-18 04:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
supports all KMD asset chains that I know of, but beware of Sapling edge cases (I have heard that OOT will not update to Sapling, have not confirmed)

[29-Nov-18 04:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
it could be the case, that at date X on coin Y that Sapling is not valid, even tho it's valid on KMD and most AC's. Right now the code assume Sprout + Sapling addresses are valid on KMD + all asset chains

[29-Nov-18 04:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
when sprout support ends (Feb 15th I think), the library will remove sprout zaddrs as being valid

[29-Nov-18 04:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i thought i knew a lot about address formats before this, but I still learned more by writing this

[29-Nov-18 05:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
To get sapling to merge into staked I had to "fix" the compile issues for `komodo-cli`, before I used an ifdef and a  -DSERVER in the makefile to excliude things that were not avalible to `bitcoin-cli.o` but after the verus merge, that no longer worked. after suffing around for hours I managed to fix it. 
I'm not sure why it was done the way it was, but I ended up having to do it like this commit:
https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/commit/7ca059a0fbdd453d80913c809c2ba5d2cbe59a75

This works and I no longer get all kinds of unreferanced things randomly thourgh my code. Is this something you want as a PR, it seems a much cleaner solution than how it was before.

I assume that all the other way is doing is reading the conf file... which is exactly how this works, but shortcuts anout 20 functions and hard to follow paths through the code.

[29-Nov-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
its just for bitcoin-cli? if so, and it simplifies things, sure make a PR

[29-Nov-18 05:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes just for bitcoin-cli

[29-Nov-18 05:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
required only 2 global declareations and to read ac_name directly

[29-Nov-18 05:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now there are no cross compiles of random files between komdod and komodo-cli

[30-Nov-18 06:10 AM] kmdstudent#8905
@jl777c thanks. And where are working BEER and PIZZA  electrum servers?

[30-Nov-18 06:11 AM] kmdstudent#8905
Why hyperdex does never connect to electrum server at the moment?

[30-Nov-18 06:14 AM] kmdstudent#8905
everyone could you anyone let me know?

[30-Nov-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
my coins repo should have info on current electrum servers

hi @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  do you know how long

[30-Nov-18 08:52 PM] D.rabbani#9094
does the -salvagewallet takes?

[30-Nov-18 08:52 PM] D.rabbani#9094
actually i am trying to recover my wallet

[30-Nov-18 08:52 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but i have just ran the command

[30-Nov-18 08:53 PM] D.rabbani#9094
-salvagewallet

[30-Nov-18 08:53 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but it shows no logs nothing at all

[30-Nov-18 08:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@D.rabbani look for other files, in same dir as wallet.dat, with similar names

[30-Nov-18 08:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
like wallet.dat.bak.16454353454

[30-Nov-18 08:53 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no basicaly what happened is

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i got wallet.123124.bak

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] D.rabbani#9094
something like this

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
salvage does a very specific think, it creates those .bak files

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] D.rabbani#9094
two of them with same space

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but the thing is

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] D.rabbani#9094
when i cp the wallet.12313.bak to my wallet.dat

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and i try to run the daemon

[30-Nov-18 08:54 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it just says Error with no error logs ?

[30-Nov-18 08:55 PM] D.rabbani#9094
just like empty

[30-Nov-18 08:55 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i am worried as my wallet got too much of the balance

[30-Nov-18 08:55 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i got salvagewallet through google

[30-Nov-18 08:55 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i am in need of help

[30-Nov-18 08:55 PM] D.rabbani#9094
üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
-salvage is a last ditch effort kind of thing. It's not going to always work

[30-Nov-18 08:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
your wallet.dat was corrupted, it sounds like

[30-Nov-18 08:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but it runs second time actually it creates new one second time when i run the daemon

[30-Nov-18 08:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
all salvage wallet tries to do, is "salvage" the parts of your wallet.dat that were not corrupted. Kind of like saving individual rows of a database, but it might not be able to salvage some parts

[30-Nov-18 08:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[30-Nov-18 08:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you use salvage CLI arg, it probably creates a new .bak no matter what

[30-Nov-18 08:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
any thing else i can do üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes it is

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
doing that

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the same .bak

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
with same specs

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is the size of the original/corrupt wallet.dat, and the .bak?

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
are they the same size?

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
is one bigger?

[30-Nov-18 08:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
well actually the situation is the two wallet.bak files got same size

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, did you have funds in taddrs, zaddrs, or both, in that wallet?

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
i want to know the size of original and .bak, not multiple .bak files

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
in that wallet üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
original .dat file is not there

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
actually my scenrio was

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
liek

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
original wallet.dat is gone, sounds like a bigger issue

[30-Nov-18 08:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh üò¶

[30-Nov-18 08:59 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i am helpless üò¶

[30-Nov-18 09:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i am trying to run it again without salvage

[30-Nov-18 09:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hope it will work now

[30-Nov-18 09:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
-salvage requires a corrupt wallet.dat to work on

[30-Nov-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
if there is no wallet.dat, you will not have a useful .bak file

[30-Nov-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
it is probably creating an empty .bak, if you start with no wallet.dat

[30-Nov-18 09:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it worked now

[30-Nov-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
"empty" BTC wallets are still a few kilobytes of metadata/etc

[30-Nov-18 09:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but the size of it is large

[30-Nov-18 09:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
what i have done is mv .bak file to wallet.dat

[30-Nov-18 09:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and started the daemon

[30-Nov-18 09:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are really confused

[30-Nov-18 09:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i am

[30-Nov-18 09:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
indeed as i am learning

[30-Nov-18 09:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
just a moment

[30-Nov-18 09:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
you were right
