> atlast i got this error make  sure your server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port ?

This could be due to your daemon crashing.

[21-Dec-18 10:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it was working fine on 16th december

[21-Dec-18 10:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when i updated the komodo

[21-Dec-18 10:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i needed to send transactions today

[21-Dec-18 10:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
to someone and igot stuck for a long time after that i got this error

[21-Dec-18 10:13 AM] Mylo#8306
Sounds like RPC is not responsive/hung or crashed.

`ps aux | grep komodod`

[21-Dec-18 10:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[21-Dec-18 10:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
just wait please

[21-Dec-18 10:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but how the blocks are building up ?

[21-Dec-18 10:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the blocks are still generating

[21-Dec-18 10:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
is it something to worry ?

[21-Dec-18 10:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i did the ps aux | grep komodod

[21-Dec-18 10:14 AM] Mylo#8306
One node probably still works, your other one crashed.  Hard to say, Iâ€™m not familiar with the situation but some diagnostic checking we can work out what is going (or not going) on

[21-Dec-18 10:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
both the staking nodes

[21-Dec-18 10:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
not getting info

[21-Dec-18 10:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
both giving the similar error

[21-Dec-18 10:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Error : Couldnt connect to the server timeout reached (Code 0)
Make sure server is running and you are connected to the correct RPC port

[21-Dec-18 10:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but on the server that got the explorer its getting the info because its in docker file

[21-Dec-18 10:15 AM] Mylo#8306
What was output of ps aux.....

[21-Dec-18 10:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the output of ps | aux is 
its giving me my command of the daemon with ./komodod 
and grep --color auto =komodod

[21-Dec-18 10:18 AM] Mylo#8306
Ah ok youâ€™ve got docker too and an explorer.  Explorer is in docker?

`tail -n 100 -f ~/.komodo/yourchainname/debug.log`

[21-Dec-18 10:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
no only explorer is inside the docker

[21-Dec-18 10:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but the problem is not with explorer

[21-Dec-18 10:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the problem is with these staking nodes

[21-Dec-18 10:19 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the rest staking node 1 and 2 are setup with normally cli commands no docker

[21-Dec-18 10:19 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i check

[21-Dec-18 10:20 AM] Mylo#8306
What block number is explorer displaying at the moment?  Just for info

[21-Dec-18 10:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
94113

[21-Dec-18 10:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the block is generated about seconds ago

[21-Dec-18 10:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094

`

[21-Dec-18 10:27 AM] D.rabbani#9094
what is that sir ?

[21-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Mylo#8306
Itâ€™s like doing `getinfo` but you need to substitute rpcuser/pass and port for your server.

[21-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Mylo#8306
curl is http command.

[21-Dec-18 10:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its in .komodo right

[21-Dec-18 10:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i need to run in web?

[21-Dec-18 10:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the curl command?

[21-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Mylo#8306
No itâ€™s command line

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai i need to replace the rpc user and password

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and port

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
with mine

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Mylo#8306
Where is explorer connected to?

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes replace rpc user pass and port

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai sir

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Mylo#8306
Oh is this DION chain?

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
in this RPC port i get it from .komod ?

[21-Dec-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes sir

[21-Dec-18 10:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have no idea why it stopped

[21-Dec-18 10:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[21-Dec-18 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
dont know what happened

[21-Dec-18 10:31 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok.  Iâ€™m on phone.
Hmmmm DION.... 
try `netstat -ptan | grep komodod` and port number might be in output

[21-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Mylo#8306
And make a note of your rpc port

[21-Dec-18 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[21-Dec-18 10:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then get the details from .info ?

[21-Dec-18 10:33 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes .komodo/DION maybe it is there

[21-Dec-18 10:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
