the list of notary nodes is in the source code

[30-Oct-18 08:43 PM] TK#2921
So after the notary nodes election, the source code is changed and all notes must upgrade. I suppose that the blocks from the nodes with the old notary nodes list are rejected. Am I right?

[30-Oct-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
correct

[30-Oct-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
though there will be at least 50% overlap

[30-Oct-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it is not in the latest list, it isnt a valid notary and cant be part of a valid notarization

[31-Oct-18 12:02 AM] TK#2921
Thanks for all your answers

Dont use the new website text editor on git to resolve conflicts, it somehoe just wswitched branches on me, and merged a whole branch into master, when it was meant to merge from master LOL

[31-Oct-18 11:55 AM] CMaurice#1685
great, great docs @Bryan_Beus would've saved me a lot of time a long time ago, and still have much use for me

[31-Oct-18 11:56 AM] CMaurice#1685

On Komodo Platform is there any API to show coin supply?

[31-Oct-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is called coinsupply

[31-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but best to call it with low heights like 50000, 100000, ... as it has to scan the blockchain from 0 to the height the first time

[31-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
after the first time, it is fast

[31-Oct-18 01:13 PM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
Thanks @jl777c  sorry didn't found on the official document API

[31-Oct-18 01:13 PM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918

@dukeleto
1) Has the dPOW-conf feature i.e., `confirmations:` ,` rawconfirmations:` already been added to GAME and EMC2 
2) Will it be added to future external chains that get notarized?

[31-Oct-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang i have just added it to Hush, it's in testing there. It has not been added to GAME/EMC2 yet. Currently only KMD + AC's have it

[31-Oct-18 05:11 PM] gcharang#6833
Thanks duke. But it will be added to the external chains in the future?

[31-Oct-18 05:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang that is the plan. it's not a consensus change, so coins can update and add dpowconfs, without a hardfork/etc

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it. there is going to be an article announcing this addition to KMD and ACs so wanted clarity about external chains

[31-Oct-18 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang Hush will be the first external dpow coin to get dpowconfs, then it will be easy to port that to other external coins

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ thanks, `grep -r` with an existing pool name finally found it for me. I inherited this explorer server and I only touch it rarely

[31-Oct-18 07:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
because `/bitcore-livenet/bin/mynode/node_modules/insight-api-hush/pools.json` in a random user dir makes total sense

@jl777c i have not fully looked thru all of this code, but this guy has a new zec gui wallet and has implemented an automatic Sapling Turnstyle migration, complete with QT GUI.

@ulhaq.anwaar 
If you need a webservice it can be found below and returns the coinsupply for chains

http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=KMD
http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=PIRATE
http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=DEX

If you run it locally on your own node even better!

Hello, has anyone encountered this error while building komodo? Makefile:2839: recipe for target 'libbitcoin_server_a-addrman.o' failed

[01-Nov-18 09:17 AM] Alright#0419
which branch are you trying to build?

[01-Nov-18 09:19 AM] beybietron#2493
dev I presume, I'm following this guide: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-manually

[01-Nov-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419

Can we send the  Block reward to an Address instead of a Pubkey???

[01-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
@ulhaq.anwaar why?

[01-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
just get the pubkey of the address you want to use

[01-Nov-18 10:04 AM] beybietron#2493
I still have the same issue üò¶ anything that makes targets libbitcoin_server* fails for me

[01-Nov-18 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
double check you have dependencies?

[01-Nov-18 10:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
@beybietron create a github gist with full build error and paste here

[01-Nov-18 10:50 AM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
@Alright ! the address who is receiving the rewards are like so many so we have trouble in monitoring or you can say it's requirements from the client.

What I did was I get the public key of that address by validateaddress and used that pubkey but a different address is receiving the stack every tmie

[01-Nov-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if -pubkey is used properly, mined rewards will go to the -pubkey address

[01-Nov-18 10:53 AM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
@jl777c that means it's not working the way it should. Just one address should be receiving all the amount

[01-Nov-18 10:54 AM] beybietron#2493
looks like my issue was memory related, increased swap size to 2GB and it looks like it pushed through, but not getting new errors

[01-Nov-18 10:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh gosh

[01-Nov-18 10:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, you usually need 4GB of RAM to compile any Zcash fork

[01-Nov-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
on startup does it display the pubkey is being used?

[01-Nov-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
one of the first printouts it shows the PUBKEY.(....)

[01-Nov-18 10:57 AM] beybietron#2493
well let me actually set it to 4GB first before pasting my new errors, maybe it's memory related as well

[01-Nov-18 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
you can run a pre-compiled komodod with 2GB, but 4GB of swap/ram is usually needed to compile

[01-Nov-18 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326 (pinned)
```Swap Space (Optional)
You will need at least 4GB of RAM to build hush from git source, OR you can enable a swap file. To enable a 4GB swap file on modern Linux distributions:

sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile```

[01-Nov-18 11:33 AM] beybietron#2493
Yup, set swap to 4GB, and it compiled

[01-Nov-18 11:34 AM] beybietron#2493
newbies like me always get blocked by this. that's what I get I guess for finding the cheapest vps

[01-Nov-18 11:35 AM] beybietron#2493

some of the best non-crazy arguments about why BTC is not as decentralized as people think

[01-Nov-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
based on balance KMD NN are much better distributed

[01-Nov-18 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's concerning how few full BTC nodes are running outside of US/EU

[01-Nov-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but, but, china controls BTC

[01-Nov-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
reality seems more BTC nodes in australia than china

[01-Nov-18 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
China only mines

[01-Nov-18 06:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
China runs very few full nodes, it seems

[01-Nov-18 06:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
the article goes into the fact that most early HODLers are from English speaking countries (US/EU/etc) but almost all mining is done by Chinese that don't run full nodes now

[01-Nov-18 06:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't seem sustainable, it seems that some future geopolitical conflict will involve BTC

[01-Nov-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
you mean, like BCH

[01-Nov-18 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
BCH has their feet in multiple camps. They hate BTC, but rely on it to exist

```China identifies Bitcoin as an attack vector. It commits the tens of billions necessary to commandeer the network by ransoming electricity generation, paying off domestic miners, and taking ASIC manufacturers‚Äô supply chains hostage.```

[01-Nov-18 06:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have no doubt China would do this, if they thought it was best. Russia and US do not even have that option

[01-Nov-18 06:39 PM] dukeleto#7326

`BTC full nodes are pretty centralized in very few areas`
Saying that "BTC brings financial freedom to the 'unbanked'" sounds great.... until the reality sets in and you realize that there's only like 9 people in the Congo that have interwebz üòñ

[01-Nov-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
and give them the choice of running a costly full node for no direct benefit to themselves or make coins mining some CPU-mineable thing, what will people choose?
