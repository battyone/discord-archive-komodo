this company has announced a tech to eliminate latency and speed up block propagation, that any blockchain project can adopt without core changes. No actual details revealed yet.

[27-Jul-18 09:11 PM] HashUnlimited#9427
Looks like a 2nd layer to me. Thing is, latency and propagation are an issue to a certain limit, definitely not the only one we are facing in the scaling debate.

@Bryan_Beus 
1.  Here's a fork of the platform docs, do not rely on it!!  But these destructions will get you to your own html copy on your local machine https://github.com/imylomylo/KomodoPlatformdocs/blob/master/docs/install.txt
2.  Using the output html, you could maybe include it or some other way (file at a time) into a react component like the answer here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39758136/render-html-string-as-real-html-in-a-react-component

OR

Some other react-inject-html method.

In the instructions of install.txt above, instead of `make html` you could get lucky with `make xml` following http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5.1/man/sphinx-build.html and from this xml convert it to json with https://github.com/hay/xml2json

And then use the json structures inside your react component to get _the good bits_ 
YMMV of course, but could be a handy way of extracting useful bits of info for side-doc-projects etc.

Excellent. Thank you

[28-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo I'm not yet at the point where I'm working with React. I did a few projects in it as a part of those night classes I took, but not enough that I'm ready to integrate it with everything else. 

Soon though, hopefully. 

In the meantime, I'm just using Node.js, PostgreSQL (with Sequelize as middleware), and Express.js as well. 

Not sure what that might change for the Travis stuff. I'll take a look.

[28-Jul-18 04:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Taking a look at this first doc. 

Not too familiar with python, but it looks like we don't need to know much.

[28-Jul-18 05:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can store the html files as strings and then use .ejs file format with the `<%- fileHere %>` method to get them into the page. Not a problem at all.

[28-Jul-18 05:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
No need for react, then, for now (I think)

[28-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo 
All the python stuff was kind of confusing, but I found a much easier workaround.

Just using a standalone file converter called `pandoc` seems to do the trick just fine.

It doesn't have a whole lot of automation for the file directory structure, but I think I can get enough mileage out of the `fs` module to get by.

[28-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
From there, I can save pandoc's output as a html fragment, put that in the database, and then render it within ejs. 

Seems to be okay! Kind of exciting. We might have something to see relatively soon... fingers crossed.

[28-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Seko#7408
are here also german speaking developer present?

[29-Jul-18 12:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Seko there are a few developers that speak German natively here

[29-Jul-18 05:23 AM] Seko#7408
@dukeleto I‚Äòm looking for German native speaker for an interview in German. I try to place articles about Komodo in WWW, a little help for marketing in Germany...

[29-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Doesnt @ca333 speak german?

[29-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Acura was german if I recall correctly

@Cryptoon I know Acura, but I‚Äòm looking for a developer...

[29-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
From interviews with @ca333 I always had the impression he had a bit of a german english accent, could be way wrong though üòÉ

[29-Jul-18 09:39 AM] Acura#2748
i think @cipi  is also German üòÉ

[30-Jul-18 12:24 AM] ca333#0118
@Cryptoon - yes i speak german. But i am not a native speaker.

Guys, I am new here.. which are product git repositories? can have the Links/URL

[31-Jul-18 02:54 AM] Mylo#8306
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform has the main ones.  Agama wallet, BarterDEX GUI, Komodo daemon.  There are a few other things around the "project owner's repos"

hi guys

[31-Jul-18 10:21 AM] OTC1#6896
where i could change node ip address .. tks

[31-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Mylo#8306
in conf file or from command line `-bind=<addr>`

[31-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Mylo#8306
try that

[31-Jul-18 10:46 AM] OTC1#6896
tks bruv

[31-Jul-18 10:56 AM] OTC1#6896
do i need to declare ac_supply to change the ip  not really isn't it ?

[31-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Mylo#8306
you need to supply ac_supply.  it is one of the critical starting parameters.   without ac_supply the chain's network is "different" than the one you intend to be connecting.

[31-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Mylo#8306
but not for komodod (KMD native coin)

[31-Jul-18 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@OTC1 what, exactly, are you trying to do?

[31-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Mylo#8306
only if you use -ac_name

[31-Jul-18 11:00 AM] OTC1#6896
justing adding a new coin under the komodo network

[31-Jul-18 11:01 AM] OTC1#6896
got you

[31-Jul-18 11:01 AM] OTC1#6896
but to change the ip i couldn't there

[31-Jul-18 11:02 AM] OTC1#6896
should i need repeat as the documentation showing us

[31-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Mylo#8306
-addnode if you want to connect to a seed node.   -bind=<addr> if you have multiple NICs in your machine and you want to bind to one address.

[31-Jul-18 11:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, there's no real IP that needs to be "changed", but you can always use/change the param `-addnode=` to direct folks to a specific peer IP without any change to the actual coin

[31-Jul-18 11:06 AM] OTC1#6896
let say ... i got the coin named XP and i would like to create an asset under that XP coin, is it possible pls ?

[31-Jul-18 11:07 AM] OTC1#6896
the idea is create a coin,  and add into hypedex and creating more asset under that XP coin

[31-Jul-18 11:07 AM] OTC1#6896
is that make sense ?

[31-Jul-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
that *is* possible, **but** only if that XPcoin were a fork of Komodo; you can't do an asset of an asset, if that's what you mean

[31-Jul-18 11:08 AM] OTC1#6896
XP/KOMODO

[31-Jul-18 11:08 AM] OTC1#6896
XP/ASSET not ?

[31-Jul-18 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes

[31-Jul-18 11:09 AM] OTC1#6896
so komodo just allowed there XP/KOMODO

[31-Jul-18 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, komodo lets you create any number of your own asset chains

[31-Jul-18 11:10 AM] OTC1#6896
just another example

[31-Jul-18 11:10 AM] OTC1#6896
XP  coin

[31-Jul-18 11:10 AM] Mylo#8306
STOP!   you can have an asset (and whole exchange) on your own blockchain.  it's in development.

[31-Jul-18 11:11 AM] OTC1#6896
is it in development ?

[31-Jul-18 11:11 AM] Mylo#8306

how about the parameters ( fields ) in that smartcontracts is there any flexibility to change --> json ?

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
You can create XP, XPa, and XPb and market XPa and XPb as part of XP, but/and they would be each their own chain

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] OTC1#6896
wow no

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Mylo#8306
@ComputerGenie 
No you have your assetchain (independent blockchain) and you have your token economy on your own blockchain.  as many tokens as you need.

[31-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Mylo#8306
you can also have 3 separate blockchains.

[31-Jul-18 11:14 AM] Mylo#8306
like genie mentions.

[31-Jul-18 11:14 AM] Mylo#8306
this is standard.

[31-Jul-18 11:14 AM] Mylo#8306
the tokens is bleeding edge new

[31-Jul-18 11:14 AM] Mylo#8306
New stuff üòÑ

[31-Jul-18 11:15 AM] OTC1#6896
how i can get this done in practical terms

[31-Jul-18 11:15 AM] Mylo#8306
what param do you want changed?  plenty of flexibility

[31-Jul-18 11:16 AM] OTC1#6896
simple ... create a coin -> and  create pairs let say ( XP/USD )

[31-Jul-18 11:16 AM] OTC1#6896
and starting creating a asset under that XP

[31-Jul-18 11:17 AM] Mylo#8306
oh you just want your own coin.  then make it as pre the first link to create your assetchain.

[31-Jul-18 11:17 AM] OTC1#6896
but i need to contract for each asset on spec fields

[31-Jul-18 11:17 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Mylo I'm aware, but I try not to point folks to the new-new-new stuff unless they are obviously looking for being that far out on the edge (some of the cc code is only days old)

any help to get done ? i need partners

[31-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah, you make your coin.  and you list it for inclusion on hyperdex/barterdex.
if you want to make your own ecosystem of coin, branded DEX, branded wallet - then you can do that.
plenty of help.  can you code? or do you need ppl to code it for you?

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] OTC1#6896
i can code but finding  some guys in the core

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] OTC1#6896
we can get done fast

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] OTC1#6896
instead take ages

[31-Jul-18 11:22 AM] OTC1#6896
prefer to share the bread

[31-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Mylo#8306
i can't speak for the core guys, only for me.  but i'm not here to make partners.   i have my pet projects.  if you need help whilst you work on your own  things, this place can help.  otherwise if you want other people to do work on your idea, you can wait for other devs to be here and ask them, but they are likely going to answer the same.
otherwise some of our community have started businesses to help you get started fast, e.g. chainzilla.io and chainmakers.co
if you have funds to pay for core dev to make changes to the core - this is a different thing.
but for dApp development, we are all working on the project and sometimes on our own pet projects.
