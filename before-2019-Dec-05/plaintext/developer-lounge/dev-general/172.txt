overwintered != sapling-enabled, I know that

[04-May-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
for kmd it is as both were updated the same time

[04-May-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, agreed

[04-May-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
blossom seems likely we wont adopt due to all the strange things upstream

[04-May-19 01:44 PM] phm87#7395
I read that code of ac params for n, k and pers string is developed but do you plan to add other algos ?
I don't want to talk which algo is the best but I think that some coins may want to become an assetchain but keeping their algo (whatever their reason is).
Maybe adding more possible algos as ac params requires way more work that I can imagine so sorry if the question is stupid

[04-May-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it requires adding support for each new hashalgo. I will accept a pull request for a sane method to handle many different mining algos

[04-May-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 if you make a patch for adding progpow, that is likely to be merged

[04-May-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
other weirdo algos, maybe not

[04-May-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it needs to be done in a good way, not making the current internals harder to maintain

[04-May-19 01:59 PM] phm87#7395
I don't think that I have the competencies to do it but I understand what you mean. I was not thinking about weird unknown algos but I was thinking about sha256 as example or script

[04-May-19 01:59 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[04-May-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 didn't even think of adding sha256d as an option, but it might be nice for "completeness", to allow people to use btc asics on their AC's, instead of ZEC asic's

[04-May-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't think it would be used much, to be honest

[04-May-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
but if we had ProgPOW as an option, dozens of coins are thinking about migrating to that

[04-May-19 02:05 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know, I'm new to Komodo ecosystem so I really don't know which kind of coins asks KMD team to have dpow

[04-May-19 02:05 PM] phm87#7395
thank you for your insider's infos ^^

[04-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
if a small new coin starts

[04-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
and decides to use SHA256D, then an immense amount of hashpower in the world can switch to the network at any time, causing havoc

[04-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
hence, small coins don't use sha256d

[04-May-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
the same thing happened with equihash 200,9

[04-May-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you have DPoW to protect you, the problems are much less

[06-May-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @dukeleto 👋
Would it be difficult for a competent dev to add  SHA256D as an algo, as you were discussing above?

[06-May-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
blackjok8r already added a new hashing algo

[06-May-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the first step is to make a table driven way to specify new algo

[06-May-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
once that is in place, then it would be a matter to just make new table entries and link in the hash function for each algo

[06-May-19 12:00 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks a lot!

[06-May-19 06:54 PM] phm87#7395
@Ondalf  😮 I didn't know that blackjok3r already added a new algo, it is super cool

[07-May-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Technically miket added most of it, I just finished it off... The way its done is silly and messy. It works but for adding mroe algos we need somehting better, like james suggested above

[07-May-19 10:56 AM] artem.pikulin#0794

this is a new trend, coins which are just outsourced to agencies that barely know anything

[08-May-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
wow! they will start work on adding sapling!!

[08-May-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c one day, they might start

[08-May-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
one glorious day

[08-May-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
I found about 10 source code forks of ZEC which were on sapling already, all the rest are on Sprout

[08-May-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
and most of those are still on old-vulnerable-sprout, not groth16

[08-May-19 04:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@dukeleto I was reading the article expecting some drama or internal struggle, but nope.  They just couldn't pay their devs and were held at "ransom" by the 3rd party team who wanted more money.  

As the list of possible outcomes grew in my mind before reading the article, that scenario didn't even occur to me.
🤷

[08-May-19 04:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Keep learning, right?

[08-May-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so how is such a sillycoin listed on CMC and PIRATE isnt?

[08-May-19 04:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I asked the $troll coin dev the same question last night.
He did make a good response.

[10-May-19 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
vaguely remember there being a way to make block 1 not mined to ac_pubkey/ac_script. Does anyone know how to do this?

[10-May-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright where would it go, otherwise?

[10-May-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
to miner of block 1

[10-May-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
anywhere miner specifies

[10-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe if -ac_supply=0

[10-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
it just goes to where-ever

[10-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
but otherwise, block 1 is pre-mine

[10-May-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
I have a problem in that I told ZEX I'd do a airdrop/snapshot to a new POS chain, but block 1 is mined to ac_pubkey, so I can't distribute the airdrop on the new chain without having ac_pubkey privkey(which I don't want to ever have)

[10-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
interesting

[10-May-19 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
and getting the person that does have the key to sign a raw tx has been a hassle

[10-May-19 01:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe we need a new -ac_ param to deal with this

[10-May-19 01:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
bbiab, ENO☕

[10-May-19 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
I know there is was a way to accomplish this, just can't for the life of me remember how

[10-May-19 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
have to check the code, I think there's an exception to let block 1 go anywhere somewhere

[10-May-19 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
not focused on it atm though

Hello! I don't know if is the correct space to my qurstion but i think so, hahaha. I'm thinking of a system that use bitcoin to colaterize a stable token and give the tx fees as rewards for those who locked bitcoin to mint  that token. Likely Dai. Is it possible on komodo? (Because of interoperability)

[10-May-19 10:01 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

Where can I find the latest release of the Komodo CLI?

[13-May-19 05:56 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
I have a script that was installing from: https://api.github.com/repos/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/latest  but looks like that is no longer working

[13-May-19 05:57 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
I'm guessing due to all the releases being tagged prerelease now?

[13-May-19 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Oliver Westbrook whatever is on the `dev` branch is considered the latest release of the komodo CLI :troll_king:

[13-May-19 06:03 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
okay, I'll do some tweaking on the script

[13-May-19 06:03 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752

[13-May-19 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326

[13-May-19 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
`dev` branch is extremely stable

[13-May-19 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are like 4 branches that things get tested on before things hit `dev`

[13-May-19 06:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Oliver Westbrook i was being snarky, but there might be binaries for you to use somewhere, maybe travis ci

[13-May-19 06:05 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752

[13-May-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326

[13-May-19 06:07 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
I'll just make my own and host them on veruspay

next I'm throwing in zec and btc as well as any pbaas, then going down the list of komodo ecosystem coins and the ability to manually add any btc or zec forked coin as a store owner.
