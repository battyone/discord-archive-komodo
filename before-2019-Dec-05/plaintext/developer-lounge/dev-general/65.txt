code goes into opreturn

[26-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is interpreted

[26-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but it also needs to interface to the blockchain internals

[26-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it wont be able to do much

[26-Nov-18 07:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, that is a very specific thing

[26-Nov-18 07:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i was thinking "high level language bindings to CC RPC interface", but an interpreter is a whole new level of complexity

[26-Nov-18 07:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c exactly what kind of code goes into opreturn? the source code of the "smart contract", written in a high level language?

[26-Nov-18 07:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
or some kind of already-serialized code?

[26-Nov-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the python code, maybe compressed

Can anyone with git and github experience spot what I'm doing wrong here?

I'm trying to deploy to GitHub pages. It should be fairly standard stuff, and has always worked until I recently started collaborating with others in the same repository. Once I pulled in changes from a dev branch that had a few commits from another user, deploying to GitHub Pages stopped working.

I'm assuming that there's some environment variable somewhere that's giving git troubles, but I'm not sure where.

Here is the deploy.sh file that I run, and which is supposed to automate the entire GitHub pages creation process.

https://github.com/siddhartha-komodo/komodo-docs-vuepress/blob/master/deploy.sh

And here is a Gist with the terminal output when I run it.

I tried commenting out the `GIT_USER` stuff and returning it to `siddhartha-komodo`, my username.

This makes life difficult for gcharang, so we'll have to get it resolved, but it at least works for now.

giving away maintainership to unvetted people is worse than letting something die, but it's pretty hard to decide if somebody taking over is evil

[26-Nov-18 09:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
```To know if your project is in danger, run:

npm ls event-stream flatmap-stream
The bad actor has publishing rights to event-stream and flatmap-stream contains the malicious code (specifically flatmap-stream@0.1.1, but any future version can't be trusted).

ok, this is pretty sneaky, and gave me a laugh: ```After he adds it at almost the exact same time the injection is added to flatmap-stream, he bumps the version and publishes. Literally the second commit (3 days later) after that he removes the injection and bumps a major version so he can clear the repo of having flatmap-stream but still have everyone (millions of weekly installs) using 3.x affected.```

that is a scary thing to read, npm registry is not something that is well secured

[26-Nov-18 10:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
and now we know, for sure, there are various packages that want to steal wallet.dat files, and it's a gamble if your code pulls them in or not

[26-Nov-18 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
the Node + Javascript community as a whole values "moving fast" and "re-inventing the world slightly better every 6 months" to a frightening degree. It causes so much bloat and waste, it's very bizarre for Perl people that are usually worrying about wasting a few bytes

[26-Nov-18 10:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
i know that there are always issues with developers listing optional dependencies as non-optional

[26-Nov-18 10:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
the software has no way to know, it just installs a bajillion things

[26-Nov-18 10:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
and if you know you will never use random features, you can "cheat" and install less stuff. But also, nightmare errors might happen.... And I don't like dealing with nodejs backtraces.... ü§¢

if all parties agree, it's indistinguishable from pay to pubkey hash, if parties don't agree, one party can make public the proof of what the contract entails?

hi i just got a querey about DPOW

[27-Nov-18 07:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
in case of DPOW is implemented will the blocks stop for certain time ?

[27-Nov-18 07:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
or will it go on

[27-Nov-18 07:30 AM] gcharang#6833
Unless there is an attack on the network, the presence of dPOW is barely noticeable. When a competing chain is introduced(that has been privately mined),  then the public chain is accepted by the network. This is the basics of dPOW. For a more general explanation, see:https://docs.komodoplatform.com/whitepaper/chapter3.html
