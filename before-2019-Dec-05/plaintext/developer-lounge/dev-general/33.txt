the java ides now have good cpp support, eclipse was good for java functionality like that.

[09-Oct-18 11:50 AM] Mylo#8306
with cpp support, would be suitable.

[09-Oct-18 11:50 AM] Mylo#8306
but it's cumbersome

[09-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Mylo#8306
in my experience where you gain simplicity for stuff you are used to but don't like, but lose on being out of control - and when something goes wrong, it takes 0.5 days to fix it.   i prefer stability/no-nonsense.

[09-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
Trying VSC now. It seems ok for now. But most of things I tried fail on a simple thing. Declare variable, do not use it anywhere, they do not report nothing....

[09-Oct-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just use vim and atom, and use the compiler to test validity am I doing it wrong ?

[09-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810

vim+screen is my IDE

[09-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tmux is better than screen... I do a LOT of my testing and stuff using tmux and vim.  but write all my main code in atom, because Im lazy and it does most of the syntax of stuff for you. Very helpful if you new to a language.

[09-Oct-18 12:52 PM] Mylo#8306
i prefer screen.   both i can't scroll though (haven't configured) if there is a tmux scroll up setting for mouse (or shift+arrowkey) i'd give it another go

I have been using that on my notary.... on a lot of the vps I use its direct tmux and its much more annoying.

[09-Oct-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lots of ppl hate mouse, but I find it to be much easier still

[09-Oct-18 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
my muscle memory is bound to screen. I have seen the "screen-config-for-tmux" configs, but meh. I got so many existing screens and .screenrc's 😃

if starting from scratch right now, as a new dev, use tmux

drives me crazy when an RPC works via curl and for some reason not the -cli

[10-Oct-18 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
somehow hush-cli is sending some argument as a string instead of an int, why is this so hard

[10-Oct-18 04:30 PM] Mylo#8306
lol

[10-Oct-18 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, sorry

[10-Oct-18 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
the cli forces the argument to be a string, which is wrong

[10-Oct-18 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
`1` vs `"1"` in params

[10-Oct-18 04:30 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah frustrating.

[10-Oct-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just had something similar happen on TROLL box... decided to write the send script in bash rather than python to leverage existing code, and ended up ahving to use curl to send hte command... meh it works

[10-Oct-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It worked via CLI but wouldnt accept `"`  from a bash script, even if the were susing \

@blackjok3r amazingly there is just 1 optional integer argument, no json processing and it still doesn't work 😿

[10-Oct-18 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am trying to debug why many new dpow-enabled coins have a broken getchaintips

including KMD, GAME + EMC2

[10-Oct-18 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah.. the command line aguments are wird ... I ran into a fwe issues making that change to z-mergetoaddress aswelll

[10-Oct-18 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH + VRSC don't fail the same way, that is my only current clue

[10-Oct-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least you ahve a clue

I seriously expected VRSC to fail the same as KMD, instead it gave me 1GB of JSON

[10-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Mylo#8306
you forgot to say "now get off my lawn"

[10-Oct-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1GB of JSON sounds liek thatmight be the probelem... how much RAM does the system have... maybe its just crashing due to no ram?

[10-Oct-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I like to take simple options first

[10-Oct-18 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r if you want to crash KMD on your NN, just run `getchaintips` 😃

[10-Oct-18 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, it could be that the response is so large that something overflows trying to create the JSON of it

[10-Oct-18 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
but KMD and PIRATE fail pretty fast

[10-Oct-18 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
and PIRATE has a small chain

[10-Oct-18 04:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD, all asset chains, and now GAME+EMC2 seem to have the bug

[10-Oct-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh if it does it on PIRATE it cant be chain size I wonder if it does is on a very small chain like 200 blocks

[10-Oct-18 04:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
yup

[10-Oct-18 04:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's some weird crazy bug

In the last step, while running `yarn dev`, I get this error: https://i.imgur.com/r5aFPiF.png . Does someone know how to solve this, so I can view the dico app on localhost?

@bartwr i am not a great person to ask about that particular app, but you have an exception, EACCESS in spawn. sounds bad 😃

[11-Oct-18 03:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
white screen is caused by that exception

[11-Oct-18 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
password protection works as expected if you set the password properly

[11-Oct-18 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
if you're looking to use KV for something @kimmel (Pungo.io) I'd recommend using oracles contract instead

[11-Oct-18 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
much more versatile although KV could be good for really simple things

[12-Oct-18 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181

best way for new dev is to write test programs for CC, that allows to learn what the rpc calls do and also to be able to demonstrate you can write good test prograns and find bugs

Is there or will there be something like Etherscan where we can inspect flow of tokens?

can use decker's fork of blockparser

[12-Oct-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
actually you would use getaddresstxids

[12-Oct-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and parse all the token transactions

[12-Oct-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
ultimately it is just a colored coins implementation, so if you can track all satoshis created by a specific utxo, that is the life history of the token

[12-Oct-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe counterparty has something like that

Komodo doesn't have them activated yet. you need a CC enabled assetchain. check pinned post of #cc-general channel for CCNG chain.
