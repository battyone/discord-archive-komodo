that looks bad

[13-Apr-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
build mac forces gcc-6, quite fragile

[13-Apr-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder which commit broke stuff?

[13-Apr-19 01:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I managed to use gcc/g++ 8 mate, but same results

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just used latest git pull of branch jl777

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
what I mean, is build-mac needs gcc 6

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nope, I changed it to 8

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in 2 files

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
and did it work?

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
gcc6 is forced for a reason

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
don't change that, fix the new bug

Hello, when a start my block explorer with ```../bitcore-node start``` command , all is OK . I see the block explorer on 3001 port of my VPS. But if my Terminal windows closes or my PC goes out, my block explorer website stops working. How can I proceed so that the program can run alone on my VPS without help from my PC?

[14-Apr-19 10:45 AM] jorian#4555
you can run it in tmux or screen

[14-Apr-19 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
i think screen is friendlier in this situation, so here goes: 
`screen -R explorer` to start a screen session, then in the new session do `../bitcore-node start`

[14-Apr-19 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
when it has started, do `CTRL-d` and then press `a`

[14-Apr-19 10:48 AM] jorian#4555
you'll go back to where you came from, but the session is still running. to go back to the bitcore output, run `screen -R explorer` again

How hard would it be to back engineer the daemon to see if it's doing anything funny

[15-Apr-19 12:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
It's quite easy to backdoor a full node daemon that is open source, and for nobody to see it. This is why closed source full nodes should not even be considered valid in our industry

[15-Apr-19 12:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
They are an abomination and VBK closed source full node being taken seriously is a tragedy itself

[15-Apr-19 06:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have a question about %PoS/%PoW assetchains. How does the daemon know whether the next block should be mined by PoS or PoW?

[15-Apr-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no it can be mined by either

[15-Apr-19 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if the % is not at target, tehn PoW gets infinatly harder the higher the % goes, so you cant hit a chain with high hash rate. It just wont find anyt blocks.

[15-Apr-19 06:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are you able to shine light on the error  `ERROR: CheckBlock: failed slow_checkPOW` which I believe is output by ```if ( komodo_checkPOW(1,(CBlock *)&block,height) < 0 ) // checks Equihash
            return state.DoS(100, error("CheckBlock: failed slow_checkPOW"),REJECT_INVALID, "failed-slow_checkPOW");```

[15-Apr-19 06:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If it isn't the daemon deciding whether the next block is PoS or PoW, that error is confusing me.

[15-Apr-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
either PoW or PoS could mine a block.

[15-Apr-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there should be a print in stdout at teh same time, that may be more helpful

[15-Apr-19 06:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

Want to write some tests for Android app UI and choosing language now.
 I had some experience with Java but now see that Kotlin is quite popular in this area. Is it better to write test code on Java or Kotlin? Maybe somebody here practices it and knows some advantages/disadvantages of Kotlin choice over Java?

Upd: get lost in freaking Android Studio dependencies and project subcatalogs so decided to not use both and use some Python ported solution 😃

[15-Apr-19 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gilardh p2sh is a type of address, P2SH = pay-to-script-hash, P2PK=pay-to-public-key, P2PKH=pay-to-public-keyhash, there are some others in BTC core now, but I think ZEC forks mostly have those

[15-Apr-19 07:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gilardh for instance, in each HUSH block, the first output is a P2PK address of the miner, and the second output (vout[1]) is the address of the founders reward in P2PKH format. This might be too much detail, and you can just ignore 😃

[15-Apr-19 07:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gilardh p2sh in KMD correspond to addresses that start with `b` which are like addresses that start with `t3` in ZEC and old HUSH

For configure the web wallet of Hush3, I change pubKeyHash: '1cb8' to pubKeyHash: '3c' in mainnet and now i have good address KMD generated.
What is the one byte prefix of pubKeyHash for testnet ?
Is there any other value to change?

```
module.exports = {
    mainnet: {
        messagePrefix: 'Hush3 mainnet',
        bip32: {
            public: '0488b21e',

        zcPaymentAddressHash: '16b6',

        wif: 'ef'
    }
};
```

[15-Apr-19 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it would be the same addressing

[15-Apr-19 10:05 PM] gilardh#8348
I don't understand your answer. Sorry.

[15-Apr-19 10:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Hush3 testnet is a misnomer and doesn't really exist (testnets in this ecosystem are just a new chain) and if you pick a name, the addressing for "test" is the same as "main" 
same key = same hash

[15-Apr-19 10:25 PM] gilardh#8348
ok, thank you for these clarifications so I could remove the possibility to switch to 'testnet' mode. Now I am trying to find out if other values ​​in mainnet need to be changed.

[16-Apr-19 04:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
testnets are really testchains in KMD world, because we have such great tools to make blockchains

[16-Apr-19 04:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
so what I call a "testnet" is just another asset with a slightly different name `HUSH3T`, the 100% correct term for it would be "testchain" but the industry usually would call this a "testnet"

[16-Apr-19 04:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gilardh so to clarify, make all the values exactly the same in the `testnet` part of the config

[16-Apr-19 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all the good test chains have a `CFEK` prefix and run in #kmdlabs

[16-Apr-19 08:30 AM] gilardh#8348
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  So I should put the 'CFEK' value for 'pubKeyHash' of the testnet part?

```
module.exports = {
    mainnet: {
        messagePrefix: 'Hush3 mainnet',
        bip32: {
            public: '0488b21e',
            private: '0488ade4'
        },
        pubKeyHash: '3c',
        scriptHash: '1cbd',
        zcPaymentAddressHash: '169a',
        zcSpendingKeyHash: 'ab36',
        wif: '80'
    },
    testnet: {
        messagePrefix: 'Hush3 testnet',
        bip32: {
            public: '043587cf',
            private: '04358394'
        },
        pubKeyHash: '1d25',
        scriptHash: '1cba',
        zcPaymentAddressHash: '16b6',
        zcSpendingKeyHash: 'ac08',
        wif: 'ef'
    }
};
```
