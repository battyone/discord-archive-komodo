[16-Dec-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders why the word "update" seems to be scaring and confusing so many people_

[16-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
*wonders if it might be something to do with the phrase "or funds will be lost"*

😂 

[16-Dec-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"or funds will be lost" not = "and funds will be lost" 😕

[16-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
yeah - I know - but deactivation of old private addresses is a bit severe.

[16-Dec-18 12:37 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it started with some wallet.dat error but on the other hand in the cli when i tried to get info it says rescanning

[16-Dec-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99% of the confused and fearful arn't even using z addys

[16-Dec-18 12:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
warning :errror reading wallet.dat all keys read correctly ! but transaction data or address book enteries might be missing ?

[16-Dec-18 12:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i wait for it to rescann?

[16-Dec-18 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@D.rabbani exactly what steps did you take from a while ago where it was working till now when you got that error?

[16-Dec-18 12:41 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i did nothing like just updated komodo

[16-Dec-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will do that error

[16-Dec-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cosntantly

[16-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becuase hte wallet is broken... I have ben trying to work out hw to fix it for weeks

[16-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you just need to let it rescan

[16-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to disable the rescan for staked chains ... but that made it worse

[16-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just have to let it rescan

[16-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is nothing you can do

[16-Dec-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it only happens with huge amounts of utxos from what I can tell.

[16-Dec-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has, literally, never had that error unless wallet has looked at a chain longer than the current db (i.e.: migrated from another comp that has 1200 blocks to a comp that is only at 120 or 0)_

[16-Dec-18 12:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so i wait ?

[16-Dec-18 12:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
right

[16-Dec-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[16-Dec-18 12:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r

[16-Dec-18 12:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okay ill wait for it to complete

[16-Dec-18 12:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the scanning

[16-Dec-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man just go have a beer and let it finish 🤣

{Reactions}
👆🏽 

[16-Dec-18 12:47 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hahaha cheers 😄

[16-Dec-18 12:47 PM] D.rabbani#9094
will do that 😛

[16-Dec-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure what causes it genie ... it happens on staked chains that stake most of the blocks in a chain and have thousand and thousands of utxos

[16-Dec-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
appears to be a problem with the wallet ... but I think that what I am working on fixing right now might actually fix it,

[16-Dec-18 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the two things seem unrelated ... but there is some code that was adding a tx to the wallet about 3 times on each block being reeived ..

[16-Dec-18 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
weather it was already there or not

[16-Dec-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some day, someone will migrate us off a bd that is older than bitcoin itself, and we will not have 1/2 of these problems.....

[16-Dec-18 12:50 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hope i dont need to wait for a day 😄

[16-Dec-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it takes a darn long time ... or at least it feels that whay when your watching it

[16-Dec-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I've synced ZEX from scratch 7 times already today ... it gets boring fast

[16-Dec-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what if I told you that you can copy things to a different folder and then just copy them back to replace....

[16-Dec-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what if i told you Im testing somethign that happens at a specific block height on chain sync

[16-Dec-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stop it 15 blocks before that one

[16-Dec-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already fixed it

[16-Dec-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you're only syncing 15 blocks

[16-Dec-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just got it all working

[16-Dec-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😄

[16-Dec-18 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it wasn't "broken" until you got a hold of it 😝 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[16-Dec-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it was

[16-Dec-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its the mempool fix for CC transactions

[16-Dec-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and sapling broke it

[16-Dec-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
remebre how dice wpould fork

[16-Dec-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you had a conflicting tx n your emmpool that conflicetd with a tx in the block that arrived

[16-Dec-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the block was invalid to your node

[16-Dec-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
finding all the egde cases with that has been difficult as hell ... but I think I finally have it all working as its supposed to

{Reactions}
👍🏽 (2) 😎 (2) 

[16-Dec-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes finally a chain sync witout millions of AcceptToMemory pool errors 🍻

[16-Dec-18 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
amazing wha // can do :trollface:

[16-Dec-18 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ... that was how james "fixed" it

[16-Dec-18 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was a much lower level problem...

[16-Dec-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was doing things like 3 times, that it only needs to do once ... with the fix as it was a few days ago, it would take 2-3mins to validate a full block.

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and synced ZEX without a single error 😄

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in no time at all

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks @blackjok3r  its done

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😄

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thank you

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its getting info

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ncie

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i didnt expect that

[16-Dec-18 01:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😄

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there will be more fixes for staking coming soon..

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you will find if you have more than 10,000 utxo in your wallt it will just mine invalid blocks constantly ... so keep them under that

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the komodo version is

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
0

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
0.3.1

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
??

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[16-Dec-18 01:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is it okay ?

[16-Dec-18 01:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
0.3.1 right so its updated

[16-Dec-18 01:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😃

[16-Dec-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤔  what if there was a group called "STAKED" that spent their time working on PoS.....

[16-Dec-18 01:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thank god

[16-Dec-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ... gettting to it man ... cant fix staking if validating blocks doesnt work first

[16-Dec-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
STAKED was an arbitrary name off of the top of my head @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[16-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
if you think the project is about staking, you're very wrong :trollface:

[16-Dec-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems @Alright misplaced his `understanding_the_joke.sh`

{Reactions}
😂 (3) 

[16-Dec-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani if you're interested, I've been working on some python scripts for staking

[16-Dec-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
"set and forget"

{Reactions}
🆒 

[16-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
will maintain a static amount of UTXOs, so the wallet isn't bloated as hell after a month of staking

[16-Dec-18 01:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now staking node 2 is getting
