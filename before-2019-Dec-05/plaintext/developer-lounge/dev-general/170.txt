sorry, i don't have any links to Docker image. i'll add that up as soon as i find it

[25-Apr-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
people in marketing categorized it as a negative for us because other platforms had docker images

[25-Apr-19 10:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
Using docker means you like debugging docker-only bugs üòÉ

[25-Apr-19 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
who are the main users of Docker?
exchanges and pools must NOT use it and they should only compile from source locally.
devs also should do the same for testing or building anything
only users who are looking to easify and know what they are doing, can use docker. but, there are pre-built bins that we supply which is useful as well.

[25-Apr-19 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007
using Docker in blockchain industry is kind of no no (just my opinion)

[25-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is for allowing newly onboard devs to start testing with minimal effort

Docker, as @dukeleto says, has its advantages and disadvantages.

Some of us use it for some things, but it started to get in my way I went with -in-a-box method.

[25-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Mylo#8306
@jorian is making a similar thing in rust.

To reduce tech debt, kmd in a box is straight system stuff and curl.

Docker zcash params for building an image is a pain.  However if we maintain a simple docker image that clones repo, zcash params can be mounted as a read only volume saving loads of time and space from re-use.

@jl777c can we make fetch-params ignore the large sprout files now? Is there any reason to download that stuff when sprout is not supported?

[25-Apr-19 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i believe we need those to verify the existing sprout txs that happened before sapling. hope i'm right

[25-Apr-19 12:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is a good question, I am not sure

[25-Apr-19 12:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
I feel like we don't need it

[25-Apr-19 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
HUSH3 is using sapling from block 1, you may not need that

[25-Apr-19 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
but, how about the old chains? i.e.: PIRATE

[25-Apr-19 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am unsure if it's needed to only make new xtns, or needed to verify old joinsplits

[25-Apr-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
I feel like I have seen zcash core talk about getting rid of sprout files eventually

[25-Apr-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

If sprout is still an option for assets, I would beg the question "Is that safe?"

[25-Apr-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
do we want to let them to get hit by the inflation bug?

[25-Apr-19 12:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
I would never ever launch a new chain with Sprout support, ever again. Just me, tho

[25-Apr-19 12:26 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, OOT & ZILLA still uses sprout

[25-Apr-19 12:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
did they disable zaddrs?

[25-Apr-19 12:26 PM] SHossain#0007

sorry to poop on the parade

[25-Apr-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
but it's just reality

[25-Apr-19 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
hope they change their mind before the next notary season starts. there will be a hard/major update and we could accomodate all at the same time

[25-Apr-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
I know it was about exchanges charging them, I feel that pain deeply, as Hush gets screwed over by exchanges too

[25-Apr-19 12:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
But some time soon, Sprout inflation bug will be a script any script kiddie can run

[25-Apr-19 12:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
You don't want to get caught by surprise by that.

[25-Apr-19 12:29 PM] SHossain#0007
well, everyone has to update for the next season

[25-Apr-19 12:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is why our whole ecosystem just went crazy updating to sapling

[25-Apr-19 12:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, it's good timing

for HUSH3 you probably can. not sure

about chains with preexisting sprout

[25-Apr-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
you would think it can use the new groth16 validation for sprout, but I am reluctant to mess with that code

[25-Apr-19 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker fixed the macOS build. just compiled from jl777 branch. but, during compile almost every line had additional messages `means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings.`
```

OOT and ZILLA use groth-on-sprout with latest builds

[25-Apr-19 01:03 PM] Alright#0419
Means that inflation bug would only be accepted on nodes older than December

why airdrop? just set -sapling=

[25-Apr-19 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007

Max SanchezYesterday at 7:09 PM
Thanks to everyone for their patience, as Tim mentioned we have deployed a fix for the network issue we experienced. 

If your node is stuck on a block around height 87634 then please upgrade to the following version:
https://mirror1.veriblock.org/veriblock-nodecore-all-0.4.4-rc.4.tar

You can copy your entire mainnet folder, nodecore.properties, etc. from your current nodecore version to 0.4.4-rc.4, no need to re-sync. We are going to release a new bootstrap file soon as well, for anyone who wants to use it.


There was a very abnormal block reorganization that included a block with an invalid transaction. The invalid block was (to most nodes on the network) originally received on an alternate fork (not main-chain) but a miner built another block on top of that invalid alternate block which caused the network to attempt to switch over to this "now better" chain with the invalid block in it. While applying the new chain the network correctly identified the block as invalid and started reverting back to the correct chain, however the unapplication left the cache of block headers in a bad state due to the order in which ledger modifications were being reversed, so pools were unable to calculate difficulty for the next template (or properly invalidate PoP transactions in their block templates which referenced blocks in the invalid fork). 0.4.4-rc.4 fixes the root cause of the issue, so reorganizations to invalid chains will always properly self-heal.
```

seems like VBK mainnet stalled yesterday and they pushed out a new hotfix version

[29-Apr-19 08:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
they are learning about re-orgs

[29-Apr-19 08:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
This guy "Max" is the CTO

[29-Apr-19 08:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
ratholesYesterday at 8:50 PM
question though, how come there is a re-org if the blockchain is protected by bitcoin nethash?  re-org leads to double spend. I thought what is promoted by VBK is security yet it is susceptible.
Max SanchezYesterday at 9:48 PM
@ratholes It was a 3-block reorg within a single keystone period. VeriBlock's PoP prevents against long-range reorg, but short reorgs will occur with any PoW blockchain due to network latency, etc. For the simplest example, if two miners both produce a block at a particular height at the "same" time, only one of those blocks will become part of the main chain, and the other will be orphaned. 

VeriBlock PoP ensures that the security level of transactions in a particular block are public knowledge and are available in real-time. In the absence of publications of competing VBK blocks at a certain height for the BTC finality period means that VeriBlock cannot be reorganized at/beyond that point without also requiring a reorg of Bitcoin itself.
```

[29-Apr-19 08:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's amazing that this is what passes for "truth" in VBK discord. I will stop now. Just some tidbits from the frontlines

[29-Apr-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
they dont even handle ordinary small reorgs properly, yet we are to believe they can handle 51% attack scenarios? it seems unlikely VBK is using the BTC info, maybe thats why it is closed source? that is part they are still working on

[29-Apr-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
36 BTC in daily volume on trex now. 10 BTC per day in BTC txfees paid by miners to get the 500000 daily VBK. I wonder what happens when the daily volumes go below the 10BTC level
