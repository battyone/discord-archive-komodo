also need for crypto condition chains, but they're both enabled by just having ac_cc

[06-Sep-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
using ac_ccactivate, you need to set both manually

[06-Sep-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
these rpc commands require both 
```
== Addressindex ==
getaddressbalance
getaddressdeltas
getaddressmempool
getaddresstxids
getaddressutxos
getsnapshot
```

[06-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Interesting. Okay, putting those down as notes...

[06-Sep-18 12:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, when I try this in my local terminal, where I didn't start up the KMD chain using the `-addressindex` method, I just get an error, even if I use an address that I know is in my wallet.dat file.

That's to be expected, correct?

[06-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[06-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, if I launch the damoen with `-addressindex=1`, will that trigger a long process?

[06-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not as familiar with `curl` commands.

@Alright, can you help me understand what we're putting in here?

[06-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
# curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getaddressbalance", "params": [{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```

[06-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
it's just a json

[06-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
you can use the same format for any rpc command

[06-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
method is the rpc command

[06-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
params is whatever else

[06-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
it's different for some commands, but generally the same concept

[06-Sep-18 01:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what is the `--data-binary` for?

[06-Sep-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
that'd be useful if you wanted to send rpc commands to komodod on a remote server

[06-Sep-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
not sure tbh

[06-Sep-18 01:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm... who suggested it go in there, do you know?

[06-Sep-18 01:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
were these examples put together originally by james?

[06-Sep-18 01:25 AM] Alright#0419
likely just from zcash

[06-Sep-18 01:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ah ha. That would make sense.

[06-Sep-18 03:21 AM] mark#1011
Is anyone here familiar with Schnorr signatures? I have an atomic swap that uses adaptor signatures (involving key and signature aggregation) in lieu of traditional bitcoin-style scripts and I would like to integrate the new technique into the codebase. Would like to chat with the relevant dev if possible

[06-Sep-18 03:27 AM] mark#1011
If this is not the right place to discuss barterdex dev, I'd appreciate a pointer to where I should go

[06-Sep-18 03:32 AM] mark#1011

Hallo, is someone know the way to get a -pubkey for CC? Now i try this command ./komodo-cli -rpcuser=blablabla -rpcpassword=**************** -rpcport=55570 validateaddress RLd49DjcRHNPoMnVVDkv5vX6RQARQT86YN
{
  "isvalid": true,

  "iscompressed": true,
  "account": ""
} Is it correct?

[06-Sep-18 07:00 AM] ttt#3928
@webworker01  thanks, but i think that i do something wrong because when try to call let's assume that "faucetinfo" i got an error {
    "result": null,
    "error": {
        "code": -1,
        "message": "to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet\n"
    },
    "id": null
}

[06-Sep-18 07:00 AM] ttt#3928
pubkey was added to komodod

[06-Sep-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it is to have a global address that can lock funds

@Bryan_Beus if there‚Äôs discrepancies in output from help, we can fix in src and submit PR.   That missing colon (:) is a good example.  If we can automate the doc creation like in other message in GUI channel, saves on administrative maintenance of docs for trivial stuff maybe

[06-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo That would be helpful.

[06-Sep-18 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus i can help you document addressindex/timestampindex/unspentindex if you need help

[06-Sep-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus please add this to your notes: "When enabling any of these indexes, if you already have a partially synced chain, you will need to delete all blockchain data and do a fresh sync with those params. Simply trying to add those indexes with -reindex will not work correctly"

[06-Sep-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
that should really be in some documentation somewhere

[06-Sep-18 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
very recent BTC core has a way to partially update indexes, maybe one day we can merge that, but it might be hard

[06-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Fantastic, thank you.

Yes, I was worried about starting this up myself. Thought it might trigger some long process.

[06-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I would only worry about it if we start getting complaints from users trying to use it.

[06-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Will you be around for a while, @dukeleto ?

[06-Sep-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
it is a long process, because you basically have to resync the whole chain with new params

[06-Sep-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus I will be around for a bit

[06-Sep-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
for a small asset chain, it's not a big deal. But enabling them on a KMD node is potentially many hours or days

[06-Sep-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
depending on your internet and hardware

[06-Sep-18 06:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
phew, glad I didn't try it.

[06-Sep-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus when I helped write `getsnapshot` I used the AXO ac, because it was the smallest

[06-Sep-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I could resync that chain completely with new params, in a few seconds

[06-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Interesting.

[06-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, let me take a look at some of these commands here.

[06-Sep-18 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
https://dexstats.info/richlist.php?asset=KMD

[06-Sep-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
all the richlists on dexstats use `getsnapshot` which relies on those indexes, in case you need an example

[06-Sep-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
without the indexes, some operations are drastically infeasible or impossible to do in a reasonable time. The indexes are like database indexes, which make common operations fast so you can get the data you want

[06-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right, it makes sense.

[06-Sep-18 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
the unspent index keeps track of every address and all of it's unspent utxo amounts in a fast and easy-to-access way. Without that, you have to do very very slow bruteforce searches to get the data

[06-Sep-18 06:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm typing on this as we speak. Thank you very much.

[06-Sep-18 06:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
webworker01 mentioned there's a config file that you can add this to, to make it a default launch parameter.

[06-Sep-18 06:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What config file is that?

[06-Sep-18 06:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
yup

[06-Sep-18 06:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
komodo.conf

[06-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
great

[06-Sep-18 06:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it already has txindex=1 by default

[06-Sep-18 06:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you can add more indexes, and then you don't have to type them on the command line

[06-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, you just add a line ``addressindex=1`` anywhere in the file?

[06-Sep-18 06:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

maybe we can add docs to the readme right there, to tell people they can add them in right there

[06-Sep-18 06:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a nice place to tell people, because if you are reading that, you are probably setting up a kmd node for the first time on a certain machine, and it's nice to know to enable the other indexes then, versus later and having to resync the whole chain

[06-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Perhaps.

I'm putting it under the ``AddressIndex`` section in the Komodo API for now. I'm not working on the GitHub readme, for now.

[06-Sep-18 06:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds good, it's an advanced option that average folks won't need anyway

[06-Sep-18 06:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, you mentioned that if your blockchain data is only partially downloaded, you have to delete all blockchain data and start from scratch.

What if your blockchain is fully downloaded? Can you add `-addressindex=1` and get a positive result?

[06-Sep-18 06:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
nope

[06-Sep-18 06:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
because even if it's 100% synced, you must stop and restart

[06-Sep-18 06:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, so you have to resync, no matter what.

[06-Sep-18 06:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, as far as I know. Weird errors happened for me when I tried to do that, before I knew this

[06-Sep-18 06:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
James suggested that adding those params later on, doesn't work, and he was right

[06-Sep-18 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus and to be even more clear, I think if you add or subtract any index CLI params, you might need to blow away blockchain data

[06-Sep-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
like, if you had addressindex but not spentindex, and then wanted to add it

[06-Sep-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
best practice, imho, would be to add all the index options, if you need any

[06-Sep-18 06:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
great, adding that in

[06-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Which folder is the blockchain data in, that should be deleted?

[06-Sep-18 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
that needs it's own little faq or whatever

[06-Sep-18 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's ~/.komodo on unixy systems, which also has wallet.dat, so people need to be careful

[06-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, I'll probably try to add that in.

[06-Sep-18 06:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
~/Library/Application Support/Komodo on mac

me neither, we won't worry about it for now

[06-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what's the name of the file to delete?

[06-Sep-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
I often run this command to do that: `rm -rf  blocks chainstate notarisations komodostate komodostate.ind`

[06-Sep-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure to tell people not to typo on that command

[06-Sep-18 06:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
heh. yes.

[06-Sep-18 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
I once used `rm -rf  blocks chainstate notarisations komodostate*` and accidentally put a space between the last word and *

[06-Sep-18 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
thankfully I am crazy and backup my wallet.dat with git, otherwise it would be gone

[06-Sep-18 06:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
which is why I listed both files above. I am not even sure if they are needed to get rid of, but I think it can confuse kmd to have that state file around that doesn't correspond to anything anymore

[06-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yesh

[06-Sep-18 06:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not user-friendly to blow away the blockchain data but not your wallet.dat, for sure

[06-Sep-18 06:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
but average users probably shouldn't be doing that anyway. maybe we can have a simple script like `clear_blockchain_data.sh` that we can tell people to use

[06-Sep-18 06:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That would be a good idea, actually.

[06-Sep-18 07:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
I wouldn't tell average  windows users to do the above steps, they definitely need a GUI/script or you will have lots of wallet.dat's deleted, most probably

[06-Sep-18 07:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto take a look at this:
Anything in the `<== ==>` is a note for the team, to be added later. You can ignore it.

```
Coin Daemon Maintenance and Parameters
======================================

<==Gcharang: we need to add this section above in the index ==>

Manually deleting blockchain data
---------------------------------
Sometimes it is necessary to manually delete all blockchain data. This will trigger a full resync of the blockchain.

Users should exercise caution not to delete the ``wallet.dat`` file during this procedure. We recommend that the user make frequent backups of the ``wallet.dat`` file, especially before deleting files from the application directory.

The following files should be deleted:

::
  ``blocks``
  ``chainstate``
  ``notarisations``
  ``komodostate``
  ``komodostate.ind``

Default file locations:
::
    MacOS: ``~/Library/Application Support/Komodo``
    GNU/Linux: ``~/.komodo``
    Windows: <<==need this==>

-addressindex
-------------
The ``addressindex`` is a parameter that is executed at run time. The command instructs a KMD-based coin daemon to make a full index of all addresses and balances. It is commonly used in web-based blockchain explorers for rapid search across the entire blockchain history.

When utilizing this command the synced blockchain data should be deleted to allow for a full resync. The user may need to manually delete the blockchain data before executing the command <==link to manual deletion instructions above==>.

The ``-reindex`` command is not a viable alternative method for resyncing the blockchain.

Usage:

To initiate the ``addressindex`` command at runtime, include ``-addressindex=1`` as a parameter.

::

  ``./komodod -addressindex=1``

To set the ``addressindex`` feature as a default parameter, include the parameter in the ``komodo.conf`` configuration file.

::

  ``addressindex=1``
```
