the "null relationship" is a relationship, sure

[06-Sep-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
0 is a number, etc.

[06-Sep-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I do not get paid (at all, or enough!) to increase the work I do to support miketout code and unfuck KMD from it occasionally

[06-Sep-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
Microsoft people are evil incarnate.

There will be no hugs

[06-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
I still remember all the evil things Mike + Microsoft did to Linux

[06-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
all of you were babies

[06-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
Y'all, I was born on this hill before you were born.

[06-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am fucking dug in.

[06-Sep-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Microsoft people are evil incarnate.`
Having spent a decade as a vb dev, I'm not sure how to take that 🤔

[06-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the people behind the company

[06-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
i.e. top execs like Mike

[06-Sep-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
he is evil

[06-Sep-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know, was just trying to lighten the mood 😛

Why do y'all care to change my mind?

[06-Sep-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
I just see less informed people trying to sway my opinion

[06-Sep-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
Which is based in fact

[06-Sep-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User what is at stake?

[06-Sep-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
Seriously, nobody pays me. I work for free. Why should I censor what I think is true? I am not afraid of somebody taking my paycheck, and hence I say things people would rather not be said

[06-Sep-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
Doesn't make them false.

[06-Sep-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
I hold my tongue plenty. KMD core people can attest to that, behind closed doors. Doesn't mean I hold it 100%.

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
I see VRSC as a disease on KMD community

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User when was the specific date that you decided to lay your shit-stirring spoon down? I'm curious.
I find an irony in how much shit you used to stir up and now you're "all about the non-drama" 😕

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
trying to overtake it, replace it, compete with it, with mikes shitty vision

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
and so, I am doing what I think is right

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
Y'all do the same

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
Dwy does the same

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is all we can do.

[06-Sep-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC is a nightmare for NN ops

[06-Sep-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
so many reasons to hate VRSC

[06-Sep-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User only "bad" in the hypocrisy sense; beyond that, no.

[06-Sep-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
If I can't voice my opinion in #dev-general, that should it be via dank memes on Twitter?

[06-Sep-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
This is supposed to be a place for conversation

[06-Sep-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
For devs to fucking talk real talk

[06-Sep-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
I requested this channel *exist*

[06-Sep-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
So if people need to be all "follow the rules for the community", meh

[06-Sep-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
dank memes are more fun

[06-Sep-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User things continue as they are

[06-Sep-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_would create #talk-dev-shit if he were allowed_

[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, because we need more channels

[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think old KMD slack still had more channels, keep going!!!

[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
The solution is "don't merge shitty code from Mike into KMD"

[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is happening on it's own

[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`yes, because we need more channels`
some honestly believe we do ☹

[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
since his code has become horrendous to merge

[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
and there are no features that KMD really wants from that "vision". But fucking chainpower is like an STD in komodo.git

[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
such a bad idea

[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
and fucking changed all our internals

[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
and nobody in KMD recommends verushash to be used, I don't

[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
what a fucking tragedy

[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
+class CBlockIndex;
+
+// This class provides an accumulator for both the chainwork and the chainPOS value
+// CChainPower's can be compared, and the comparison ensures that work and proof of stake power
+// are both used equally to determine which chain has the most work. This makes an attack
+// that involves mining in secret completely ineffective, even before dPOW, unless a large part
+// of the staking supply is also controlled. It also enables a faster deterministic convergence,
+// aided by both POS and POW.
+class CChainPower
```

[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
`unless a large part +// of the staking supply is also controlled.`

[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and nobody in KMD recommends verushash to be used...`
Isn't someone trying to put it into CHIPS? or did that get abandoned yet again?

[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
OH, like Miketout + verus foundation controlling most of the supply?

[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 abandoned, nobody paid me. And I hate Mike's code

[06-Sep-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
1 BTC "promise" was not enough. I spent lots of time on it and decided to not care anymore

[06-Sep-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
Using verushash of any version is really fucking dumb

[06-Sep-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
RandomX is actually for CPUs, if you really want a CPU algo

[06-Sep-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
But give the bitstream devs a few months, they will probably break it

[06-Sep-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
I doubt anybody in here has read more of Mike's code, except James

[06-Sep-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
So y'all need to read the scriptures, to give a speech

The patch above is unforgiveable

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I am a CPU/ASIC/FPGA miner

[06-Sep-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
and CPU mining is very hot right now, with XMR/CN coins

[06-Sep-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
🔥

[06-Sep-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, but I was going to buy it for verushash stuff 😛

[06-Sep-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
what a dumb idea

[06-Sep-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
my FPGA isn't even doing well on VRSC anymore, because of private bitstreams

[06-Sep-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
what a bunch of dumb fucks, if you think CPU mining VRSC is a good idea

[06-Sep-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
Seriously.

[06-Sep-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
Only on free CPU or free power or otherwise unusable gear

[06-Sep-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at that time there was only 1 known FPGA and it was mostly just a rumor

[06-Sep-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
Mine BLUR or LOKI or XMR or some other CN/randomx coin. Or pay me to consult with you 😉

[06-Sep-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 fpga world moves quickly and in secret

[06-Sep-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
Mining/staking VRSC just pays Mike's grocery bill, and secret FPGA miners make most of the profits (i.e. not Blackminer owners)

[06-Sep-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have timelocked VRSC from long ago and I just sell it at market price when it matures

[06-Sep-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
giving Mike a little kiss goodbye each time

[06-Sep-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
I was building a VRSC mining farm at one point, long ago

[06-Sep-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
That is what caused the fallout with Mike, he didn't treat me, a large investor, with respect. And so that mutual respect was lost. Now I lack respect for him.

[06-Sep-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_remembers someone in Komodo telling someone else that a $35k investment in KMD was (to paraphrase) "just about meaningless"; so, there's that_

[06-Sep-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
All my gear that I was using for VRSC now mines BLUR and other weird CN coins and the times are good 😅

[06-Sep-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most of my personal gear is in a literal pile currently collecting dust 😦

[06-Sep-19 01:18 PM] SHossain#0007
my 2x S2 NN servers costed me $35k 😛

[06-Sep-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_believes that, honest he does_

[06-Sep-19 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
random question:
@dukeleto how did you end up with a pool op role?

[06-Sep-19 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
i believe that was due to being in chainstrike team and they had the PIRATE pool, polly

[06-Sep-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh

[06-Sep-19 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
speaking of, I think I'm going to aggravate my wife this weekend and redo my whole pool base code 🤔

[06-Sep-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
6 pools with 3 different bases is getting a little tiresome

[06-Sep-19 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't tell duke that part of the overhaul includes adding verushash back in_

[06-Sep-19 02:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 somebody gave it to me on accident and i never complained. It can be removed if anybody is listening

[06-Sep-19 02:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't run any pools

[06-Sep-19 02:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
jeezy ran the chainstrike pirate pool, I am not smart enough to run a pool

[06-Sep-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wasn't a complaint, just a curiosity

[06-Sep-19 02:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
