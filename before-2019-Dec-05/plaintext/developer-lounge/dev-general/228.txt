[28-Sep-19 09:29 AM] gcharang#6833
let me check

[28-Sep-19 09:49 AM] gcharang#6833
@lc123456 it compiled successfully for me
which OS are you using?
have you installed all the dependencies?
how much RAM do you have available?

[28-Sep-19 11:29 AM] mrlynch#5735
i have been summoned

[28-Sep-19 11:30 AM] mrlynch#5735
still need help? although gcharang already told you what you needed

[28-Sep-19 11:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@mrlynch do you have something like "Exchange integration guide for arrr" that has instructions, do's and dont's ?

[28-Sep-19 11:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
it's more of a guideline, but yes

[28-Sep-19 11:46 AM] gcharang#6833
can you share?

[28-Sep-19 11:46 AM] gcharang#6833
does it have instructions to prevent a situation like the one exchange that allowed multiple withdraws for same coins?

[28-Sep-19 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If that's the exchange I'm thinking of, that was an internal issue related to their usage of layered tokens, so there's no real instructions from any coin that could prevent that

[28-Sep-19 11:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
@gcharang yes, give me a few minutes
 @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ yes and no, they simply credited change

[28-Sep-19 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes, I'm aware; was trying to use "broad strokes" üòõ

[28-Sep-19 11:53 AM] gcharang#6833
so, the issue wasn't because "they didn't know how to deal with z-txns" ?

[28-Sep-19 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
they use a coin > token > token > coin model (depending on the swap, but that's the shortest one)
the token bit was where the issue was
once that issue started, they were lost as to how to fix the rest (because they didn't properly record the incoming)
it's "loosely" related to z-txes, only in that they couldn't follow and "see" it later

[28-Sep-19 12:06 PM] gcharang#6833
got it

[28-Sep-19 12:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
`does it have instructions to prevent a situation like the one exchange that allowed multiple withdraws for same coins?` in regards to that it all boils down to how the exchange implements the coin and how their internals work

[28-Sep-19 12:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
i did help one particular exchange to fix their internals, with the help of jl777 (his idea actually)

Thanks for trying @Oszy much appreciated.  Im guessing the compiler is trying to use an older version of the compiler than is required but I could be wrong.  If anyone has any insight into why dev branch wont build for windows it would be much appreciated üòÑ

[28-Sep-19 02:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@Hooftly most branches are not building windows binaries

Remove rpcbind and rpcallowip

[29-Sep-19 03:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Some of the errors in your log are ignorable, Just means someone is trying to spend before funds pending transaction confirmed.

[29-Sep-19 03:06 AM] lc123456#5516
remove  rpcbind rpcallowip

[29-Sep-19 03:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Which chain are you running, and how are you doing rpc?

[29-Sep-19 03:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Is chain synced?

I'm not home right now, but will be in 30 min, can help then

[29-Sep-19 03:09 AM] lc123456#5516
chain synced already

[29-Sep-19 03:09 AM] lc123456#5516
i want to use rpc on other computer

[29-Sep-19 03:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ah ok. using curl?

[29-Sep-19 03:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
403 error could be due to firewall. is the rpc port open?

[29-Sep-19 03:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
set rpcallowip to the ip address of your external node.

[29-Sep-19 04:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just confirmed working curl on my end. here's the process, but be warned, there are potential security issues with sending RPC credentials over unecrypted connections.

[29-Sep-19 04:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
in the conf file on the host machine:
```rpcuser=your_secure_username
rpcpassword=your_secure_password
rpcport=your_rcp_port
server=1
txindex=1
rpcworkqueue=256
rpcallowip=your_remote_ip_address
```

[29-Sep-19 04:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
then on the host machine, open the rpc port for the external IP
`sudo ufw allow from <your_remote_ip_address> to any port <your_rpc_port>`

[29-Sep-19 04:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
now from the remote PC, you should be able to do the following command to confirm it is allowing external RPC access:
```curl --user your_secure_username:your_secure_password --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://your_host_ip_address:your_rpc_port/```

[29-Sep-19 04:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
alternatively, you could setup an ssh tunnel - https://blog.trackets.com/2014/05/17/ssh-tunnel-local-and-remote-port-forwarding-explained-with-examples.html

i couldn't find a proper category for this but this is our project and wanted to share it. we would like to get funded and complete it if community approves and loves project.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11x7gpfeDEnUEgnc4uPgVH0Ka3XtPHuYfTB2XDWYgWwc/edit?usp=sharing

here is our demo for "Bitrophone" project. Due to lack of sources we couldn't enable/create some features & get cloud servers, mail servers & licensing protocols for song uploads and payment screen... If we get funded for project we will use funding to get them and upgrade the website in future. But i think we created a cool thing as a demo version in less then a month with just 2 people. Also our admin panel, which you won't be able to see in this demo is almost ready. I wanted to mail you with a demo, now at least we got something to show & upgrade. We are still at %20 completion of being %100 ready for service.  

https://sabrikas.com/bitrophone/ 
demo username: demo@bitrophone.com
demo password: 123456


In this demo you can see how will our music distribution service work, 
song upload panels(disabled uploads but works on backend. we don't have cloud :D), 
payment methods(we didn't enable credit card and kmd payments, only website credits are usable to purchase in demo),
Released albums,
Subscription timings,
Upgradable plans for different type of musicians & labels.

@Hooftly 
hey, pinging you to let you know that decker found the problem with windows builds
you have to run the commands
```
sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
```
and select the POSIX version from the options after each command
then fresh clone the repo -> important as previous failed builds might affect current build
and `./zcutil/build-win.sh -j8`
will update the docs in a bit

ARRR will always show balance : 0 in getinfo because there is no transparent balance
