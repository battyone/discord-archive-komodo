@dukeleto @Alright @jl777c @Mylo 

Are any of you around right now?

I'm about to start working on some of the MoMoM documentation in the Komodo API doc. Would like to have someone around whom I can ask questions.

[10-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL 

Another noob question, if you're around.

```

It's a similar error to what we were dealing with yesterday.

What's the JSON format we're expected to put in?

[10-Sep-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810

@Bryan_Beus hey whats up

[10-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@libscott I'm working through some documentation and need your assistance on something.

@Mylo thank you, I didn't see your message until now. Good for the moment.

[10-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
One sec, @libscott, and I'll start asking questions.

[10-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@libscott 

This is the section of the documentation that I'm about to write:

```
MoMoMdata symbol kmdheight notarized_height
-------------------------------------------

``COMING SOON``

allMoMs kmdstarti kmdendi
-------------------------

``COMING SOON``

calc_MoM height MoMdepth
------------------------

```

[10-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't know what any of this is, so we'll need to get that information.

[10-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here is what a typical API doc entry looks like current, formatted in the .rst documentation style.

[10-Sep-18 08:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
getbestblockhash
----------------

::

  getbestblockhash

Returns the hash of the best (tip) block in the longest block chain.


===Insert "Run" sandbox here===
  Komodo API Demo
  (example code)
  Run/Reset Buttons
===End sandbox===


Arguments:

::

  (none)

Result:

::

    "hex"                        // (string)     the block hash hex encoded

Examples:
 *  (the myrpcuser, myrpcpassword, and myrpcport data can be found in the coin's local .conf file)

::

  command:

  komodo-cli getbestblockhash

  response:

  0dd66ee1f151c38f73843378c08715ee3f4d3cf2888783e2846b81c057987084

::

  command:

  curl --user myrpcuser:myrpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getbestblockhash", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:myrpcport/

  response:

  {
    "result": "0dd66ee1f151c38f73843378c08715ee3f4d3cf2888783e2846b81c057987084",
    "error": null,
    "id": "curltest"
  }
```

[10-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The first line is the title of the API command.

The second line is a sterilized example of how you would enter it in the terminal

Then a brief description of the command and its results.

The arguments is sterilized as well (meaning we avoid specific responses, but instead try to describe what goes in)

Same for the responses,

Then an example for a command line request, and an example for a curl request.

[10-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I need to create documentation like that for the three MoMoM commands that are currently on my plate. 

If there's more commands that you also want to knock out while we're at it, just say the word. I'm just going down the list in the presented order and can skip around.

[10-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@libscott Make sure to `@` call my username, whenever you're ready.

[10-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm going to keep working on the next section till you get back.

[10-Sep-18 08:42 PM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus  looks like a work in progress üòõ   have a feeling this stuff will come out in the wash in #private-staked channel with the fungibility between chains.

```
$ komodo-cli MoMoMdata CHIPS 1000000 1000000
{
  "coin": "CHIPS",
  "kmdheight": 1000000,
  "ccid": 1000000,
  "MoMs": [

  "notarization_hash": "8b8af87fd3cc6e5f201c41bbcc9440709a3971e7a95873744816738c022bda97",
  "MoMoM": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "data": "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

[10-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Mylo#8306
c+p into your notes for now, i'd only be guessing what it is useful for except MoMoM stuff.

[10-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So the command isn't built yet.

[10-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
?

[10-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Mylo#8306
no that is the output from live data for `MoMoMdata`

[10-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right, I just wasn't sure with all the 000s

[10-Sep-18 08:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and what did you mean by "work in progress"?

[10-Sep-18 08:44 PM] Mylo#8306
oh, 000000000 = not implemented yet, yes i think that is correct üòÉ

[10-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Mylo#8306
CHIPS is not an AC though, have to wait for #private-staked because they will be using ACs for testing MoM stuff.   sorry i can't give more concrete info, but it's definitely something that will be clearer with more "fungibility between chains testing" this and next week.

[10-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

I'm working on the `getblockhashes timestamp` method, and have another noob issue.

How do I get the correct timestamp to enter into the method?

I tried entering the time I got from two separate blocks, which I called using `getblock` and then pulled out of the `time` property

But the response I get when putting that into the `getblockhashes` command indicates I'm not doing it correctly.

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD getblockhashes 1536262905 1536262567
```

[10-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD getblockhashes 1536262905 1536262567 '{"noOprphans":true,"logicalTimes":true}'
```

[10-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
error code: -5
error message:
No information available for block hashes
```

[10-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Do we need to enable `-timestampindex` for this to work?

[10-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or should we be pulling the timestamp from elsewhere?

@Mylo

[10-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Mylo#8306
pretty sure you never need json data on `komodo-cli` command.
not sure.
but doing a `bitcoin getblockhashes` search there's issues in github about it being removed etc.
getting date on cli on linux is `date +%s` for current timestamp in unix.    take 10000 off the result.
i tried 
```
$ komodo-cli getblockhashes 1536504096 1536614096
error code: -5
error message:
No information available for block hashes
```
May not be implemented.  Might need -timestampindex.   Put it in the list of questions to ask.  You'll have lots by end of week no doubt.  Especially when you hit the wallet section z_ functions - a few missing there as well üòõ

[10-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm off for some zzzz for 3 or 4 hours.

[10-Sep-18 09:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo 

We're using JSON on these objects:

```
./komodo-cli getaddressutxos '{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb"], "chainInfo": true}'
```

[10-Sep-18 09:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, nite @Mylo 

Thank you.

[10-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto 

Using regtest to write documentations.

Do I need `timestampindex` initiated to be able to execute `getblockhashes`?

[10-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, if I need to add an index, and if I need to delete the blockchain data to do that, what happens on regtest to my past transactions and data? 

I want to keep the same address throughout the documentation, to keep it easy to edit.

If I delete blockchain data from a regtest chain, will that address become defunct? (since there's no other computer syncing)

[10-Sep-18 10:05 PM] libscott#8867
@Bryan_Beus which are the MoMoM commands you need to document?

[10-Sep-18 10:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
These are the three that I just passed in the documentation.

```

MoMoMdata symbol kmdheight notarized_height
-------------------------------------------

``COMING SOON``

allMoMs kmdstarti kmdendi
-------------------------

``COMING SOON``

calc_MoM height MoMdepth
------------------------

``COMING SOON``
```

I put the description of what I need for each above.

[10-Sep-18 10:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't need you to write it all word for word. I can do that. But I need a description of what they do, what their inputs are, outputs, etc.

And then we need examples.

[10-Sep-18 10:08 PM] libscott#8867
those are only really called by notary software

[10-Sep-18 10:09 PM] libscott#8867
do you still want to document them?

[10-Sep-18 10:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes. The notary nodes might need them.

[10-Sep-18 10:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And we also may have secondary layers of notarization at some future point.

[10-Sep-18 10:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If anyone can take a look at this, I would appreciate it.

I'm trying to use `getspentinfo` on a transaction that is confirmed, but am not getting a valid response.

[11-Sep-18 12:12 AM] libscott#8867
i dont know what most of them are

[11-Sep-18 12:12 AM] libscott#8867
just the ones to do with MoM and notarisations

[11-Sep-18 12:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus save the private key of your regtest address that you want to use over and over again

[11-Sep-18 12:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@libscott Do you mind adding details to the github page for the ones you do know?

[11-Sep-18 12:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
your transaction data will be lost and different every time your delete all your data

[11-Sep-18 12:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
but you can at least always use the same address

[11-Sep-18 12:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
just import it every time you delete and make a new regtest

[11-Sep-18 12:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Gotcha.

Hmm, I may avoid that. Having some data to play with makes things go much faster.

[11-Sep-18 12:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, thank you, @dukeleto

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
you can copy all the regtest directory data and save it somewhere

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
use it as a "checkpoint"

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
instead of deleting and starting fresh, copy over that "checkpoint"

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That's an interesting idea.

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
like saving a game state, or making a git commit

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But I just needed it for one thing.

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's exactly what the test suite does to speed stuff up

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, that reminds me, I came across `-txindex`.

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's always enabled and required for KMD

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is that an index parameter that we should describe?

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay.

Do we need to document it?

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or just leave it out?

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
sure, document it

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay.

[11-Sep-18 12:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
it makes sure to keep every transaction ever made on the blockchain, in your local node
