or the chains magic value and ports will be diffrent

[28-Sep-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry I cant find the MGNX height activation, it must have been removed.

[28-Sep-18 12:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok.

One sec and I'll c/p what I have here, so we can see if it's accurate

[28-Sep-18 12:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
The Komodo platform offers various default customizations that you use to determine the underlying nature of your asset chain. The desired combination of parameters should be included with the ``komodod`` execution whenever a coin is launched.

Changing these customizations at a later time is possible, but in some circumstances it can require customizing your code. In general, it is best to have your asset chain's parameters finalized before decentralizing the ownership of your coin. Should you discover a need to change these parameters after the fact, please reach out to our development team for assistance.
```

[28-Sep-18 12:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Does that look accurate?

[28-Sep-18 12:42 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I would maybe say `but in some circumstances it would require a hard fork` instead of `it can require customizing your code.`

Code customization could be done too, but i think it would be important to point out, even a parameter change would result in a different chain.

[28-Sep-18 12:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[28-Sep-18 12:44 AM] xRobeSx#5136
just a suggestion ðŸ˜ƒ but I suck at writing ha

[28-Sep-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, I made that change. Thank you.

[28-Sep-18 12:48 AM] xRobeSx#5136
no problem, good work! just out of curiosity, where are you putting all of the info discussed in here?

[28-Sep-18 03:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
At the moment, on my own Github repo. Mylo is traveling, so we haven't had a chance to get my contribs synced with the komodoplatform repo for this, but that is where it will all go, eventually.

[28-Sep-18 04:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Maybe my math is funky (quite possible), but I'm wondering if this formula in the documentation is correct?

```
    numhalvings = (height / -ac_halving);
    for (i=0; i<numhalvings; i++)
    reward = (reward * ac_decay) / 100000000;

For example, if this is set to ``750000000``, the block reward will drop 25% from the previous block reward each halving.
```

I think the first two lines are making things overly complicated, for one?

The last line, `reward = (reward * ac_decay)/100000000` is where I'm wondering if we should do something different...

If the idea is that `750000000` is leads to a 25% decrease, shouldn't we put:

```
reward_after_halving = reward_before_halving * ac_decay/100000000
```

Maybe I'm missing something. There might be an assumption in there about where the `100000000` comes from?

[28-Sep-18 04:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, @jl777c, I had an idea...

with CC smart contracts and z txs and addrs, it seems like you could make a smart contract template that, for it to be initiated, required a viewing key of a z address.

Is that at all possible? So, you'd be able to do smart contracts with z addresses, assuming that the controller of the z address effectively spoiled the privacy of the address, if that makes sense.

It sounds like a waste, since the point of z addresses is to be private.

But we've had a few customers express interest in a privacy-only blockchain, and we've also seen some excitement around the PIRATE project, so maybe having this feature would be useful in those circumstances?

[28-Sep-18 04:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Of course, with the way `z` to `z` txs are unlinked, it maybe still have limited use cases.

[28-Sep-18 04:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
To whoever wrote the current CC parameter documentation, good job. Overall, it needs very little work. Makes my life easier. ðŸ˜ƒ

[28-Sep-18 05:52 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
There are some clarifications needed in the ``-ac_pubkey`` parameter, and I've attempted to rewrite here. 

Can anyone please confirm if this is accurate? Thanks.

```
-ac_pubkey
==========

The ``pubkey`` parameter designates a public address for receiving payments from the network. These payments can come in the genesis block, in all blocks mined thereafter, and from every transaction on the network.

If ``-ac_pubkey`` is set, but ===link=== ``-ac_perc`` is not, this simply means the genesis block will be mined to the set ``pubkey``'s address, and no blocks or transactions thereafter will mine payments into the ``pubkey``.

``pubkey`` must be set to a 33 byte hex string. You can get the pubkey of an address by using the ===link=== ``validateaddress`` command in ``komodod``, and searching for the returned ``pubkey`` property. The address must be imported to the wallet before using ``validateaddress``.
```

[28-Sep-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it is specifically ac_pubkey parameter ... pubkey is something else entirly.

[28-Sep-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
other than that it looks ok

[28-Sep-18 06:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you.

[28-Sep-18 06:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm working on the ``ac_cc`` parameter, and I see that `0` is for no smart contracts, `1`, is for non-cross-chain smart contracts, and then for all values `>=2`, the asset chains need to choose a network that has the peers they desire.

Is there anywhere that developers can go to collaborate or at least understand the networks of `cc` clusters?

[28-Sep-18 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh that is wrong

[28-Sep-18 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED uses clusters

[28-Sep-18 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so i can help you here

[28-Sep-18 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ac_cc=1 is simply crypto conditions activated. 0 is disabled, so those are right.

[28-Sep-18 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the above 100 (so minimum 101) the chains are fungible.

[28-Sep-18 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With the correct infrustucture ( you need notary nodes for this) the chains can send coins from one chain to the other.

[28-Sep-18 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is the MoMoM tech.

[28-Sep-18 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What we did with STAKED was make it so that our chains called "STKD*..."  and "STAKED*....."

[28-Sep-18 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have their own set of notary nodes, in this way an AC cluster can control who notarizes these chains, as if anyone can notarise them, anyone could splin up a noary network and create a chain with as much pre-mine as they like then transfer those coins to another chain.

[28-Sep-18 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see official notaies ever being able to run large clusters, so this was a needed upgrade.

[28-Sep-18 06:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, there's a lot to unpack here.

[28-Sep-18 06:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let's go back to a value of `2`, but less than `100`.

[28-Sep-18 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, if you have any questions about this im your guy, im not the best at explaining so dont be afraid to ask anything even if it sounds stupid

[28-Sep-18 06:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you, you're doikng great.

[28-Sep-18 06:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, in general, you're not going to do MoMoM with an asset chain that you didn't create, is that the idea?

[28-Sep-18 06:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That is, you don't want to create an asset chain with `ac_cc=2`, and then have someone else do the same with a new coin supply, and shove those over to your chain.

[28-Sep-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, MoMoM clusters need a trusted entity to control who notarises them, or else the supply can be infinate.

[28-Sep-18 06:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right, that part makes sense.

[28-Sep-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are not fungible unless cc=101+

[28-Sep-18 06:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hang on, this is where I need more info.

[28-Sep-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what values between 2 and 100 are for,

[28-Sep-18 06:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok,

[28-Sep-18 06:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
that's what I was wondering.

[28-Sep-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my guess is they are reserved for future funtions that may be added

[28-Sep-18 06:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, in general, you don't want to make values that are between 2 and 99, inclusive, for the time being.

[28-Sep-18 06:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, okay, I'll make a note of that.

[28-Sep-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe some CC's can be acivated and others not, depending on what nuber, although its not that way at the moment.

[28-Sep-18 06:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Now, let's say I have a coin that's going to have `ac=100`. 

I don't want just anybody to be able to spin up a new chain, set `ac=100`, and inflate my coin supply.

How does the KMD software preven that?

[28-Sep-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the coins need notarization for the MoMoM to work. Without notarization with a valid set of pubkey in the source code, you cannot send coins

[28-Sep-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so those chains whilse being the saem CCid would not be fungible.

[28-Sep-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also to be noted, the same set of pubkeys needs to notarize all chains.

[28-Sep-18 06:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oooh, that's important to know.

[28-Sep-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there are 2 sets of pubkeys doing diffrent chains, they would not be fungible

[28-Sep-18 06:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, that is what we're looking for in the documentation. Excellent.

[28-Sep-18 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so 2 clusters could use the same number, as long as they have diffrent notary nodes, but I htink to avoid confusion it should just be, use a diffrent number.

[28-Sep-18 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or reccomended to use a diffrent number, but it might not be possible to know all the clusters out there that have been used.

[28-Sep-18 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hope for STAKED code to be pushed to KMD at some point, so anyone can just fork KMD and change the notaries_staked.ccp and .h files for thier own profects needs. its all backwards comaptiable.

[28-Sep-18 06:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What happens if you start an asset chain with `ac_cc=X` and you're working with one set of notary nodes, but then you want to switch to another community of notary nodes and there's already a coin there with `ac_cc=X`?

Is there a limit to how high you can set X, assuming you want to make it high so that you can decrease the probability of a collision?

[28-Sep-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can change the set of otary pubkeys defined by ERAS, which is a range of timestamps, that those notary pubkeys are valid, I think X can go as high as 9999 if not higher.

[28-Sep-18 06:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It sounds like this will be relevant, whenever we get secondary notarization layers going.

[28-Sep-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a set of notaries could notarise more than one cluster too.

[28-Sep-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but those clusters would not be fungible with each other

[28-Sep-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to be noted this is still very much in develoment, and it still has some bugs to be sorted so things could change slightly

[28-Sep-18 06:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, seems like there's a lot of details here. We may not need them all right now, since our community is just getting started, so I think I have enough info to make a basic pass, and then encourage the developer to reach out to you with more questions.

Until secondary layers of notarization and networks of competiting notary nodes becomes a thing, it's probably not necessary to go too deep.

[28-Sep-18 06:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Will send you a copy of what I write, for approval.

[28-Sep-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries that sounds like a good plan

[28-Sep-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
none of this has been used for anything, we are the first project and are basically flying blind here, there was no docs at all.

[28-Sep-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
taken me maybe a hundred hours maybe even more to get it semi-working lol

[28-Sep-18 06:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
nice

[28-Sep-18 06:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes, it's fun

[28-Sep-18 07:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@blackjok3r 

Here's what I wound up with:

```
-ac_cc
======

 * **NOTE:** This parameter is still in testing.

The ``-ac_cc`` parameter sets the network cluster on which the chain can interact with other chains via ===link=== cross-chain smart contracts and ===link=== MoMoM technology.

Under most circumstances, this parameter requires the Komodo notarization service to achieve functionality, as it relies on the ``pubkey`` of the trusted notary nodes to ensure coin-supply stability.

Once activated, the ``ac_cc`` parameter allows features such as cross-chain fungibility -- meaning that coins on one asset chain can be directly transferred to another asset chain that has the same ``ac_cc`` setting and notary nodes with the same ``pubkey``.

-ac_cc=0
--------

Setting ``-ac_cc=0`` will disable smart contracts on the asset chain entirely.

-ac_cc=1
--------

Setting ``-ac_cc=1`` will permit smart contracts on the asset chain, but will not allow the asset chain to interaction in cross-chain smart contracts with other asset chains.

-ac_cc=2 to 100
---------------

The values of `2` through `100` are reserved for ongoing development. Please do not set your asset chain to any of those values.

-ac_cc=101 to 9999
------------------

Setting the value of ``ac_cc`` to any value greater than or equal to ``101`` will permit cross-chain interaction with any asset chain that has the same ``ac_cc`` value and is secured by notary nodes with the same ``pubkey``. For example, an asset chain set to ``ac_cc=2`` in its parameters can interact with other asset chains with ``ac_cc=2``, on the same notary-node network, but cannot interact with an asset chain set to ``ac_cc=3``.
```

[28-Sep-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```-ac_cc=1
--------

Setting ``-ac_cc=1`` will permit smart contracts on the asset chain, but will not allow the asset chain to interaction in cross-chain smart contracts with other asset chains.```

[28-Sep-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
get james to confirm that part, I think posibly cross chain can still be done, but the chains are just not fungible.

[28-Sep-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if that makes sense

[28-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cross chain has a few features, a simple one being that one chain cna query KMD if a TX happened on another chain.

[28-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I am only familiar with fungible chain functions, as I am not sure anything else has been made that uses the other parts.

[28-Sep-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
any -ac_cc value over 101 means it is a fungible chain

[28-Sep-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
2 to 100 means it can do cross chain imports, but not fungible

[28-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What is the `getbalance64` command in this sentence, regarding the `ac_stake` parameter?

```
You can use the ``getbalance64`` command to get the balance you currently have in each segid you are staking in.
```

[28-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We don't have a `getbalance64` in the API/RPC docs.

[28-Sep-18 09:02 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
A google search shows something about it on Github from Verus.

```
extern UniValue getbalance64(const UniValue& params, bool fHelp);
```

[28-Sep-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it is for ac_staked chains

[28-Sep-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
all addresses are in one of 64 segments

[28-Sep-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
balance64 returns the balance in each of the 64 segments

[28-Sep-18 09:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay... I'll add it to the API/RPC list.

[28-Sep-18 09:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I added this, just for now. I won't be able to do more until I get around to testing a staked chain.

Lmk if this isn't accurate.

```
getbalance64
------------

  ** EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE **: This method is part of the new ===link=== ``-ac_stake`` functionality.

The ``getbalance64`` method is used only on asset chains that are utilizing the ===link=== ``-ac_stake`` functionality. On KMD-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS) asset chains, all staked coins are placed into one of 64 segments. The ``getbalance64`` method returns information about these coins. For further information, please reach out to our support team.
```

[28-Sep-18 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getbalance64 returns the balance of coins in each segid, and weather or not they are curretly staking

[28-Sep-18 09:49 AM] CMaurice#1685
so... these pubkeys that are referred to, if a related private key is  leaked/haxed/whatever, is the asset chain compromised

[28-Sep-18 09:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That's a good question

[28-Sep-18 09:51 AM] CMaurice#1685
btw, I've reading around here on and off a few weeks now, and have a server ready, I'm sure I want to commit some time to getting dome practical experience but finding it difficult to dive in, so any direction from devs is welcome

[28-Sep-18 09:51 AM] CMaurice#1685
I'm more a home-schooled sysadmin type than developer, in his 6th decade

[28-Sep-18 09:51 AM] CMaurice#1685
though I have writted scripts

[28-Sep-18 09:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
*written

[28-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
testing CC #cc-general is a good place to start

[28-Sep-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice #private-staked too

[28-Sep-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus ac_staked* btw

[28-Sep-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
the asset chain params doc has technical details about how segids work

[28-Sep-18 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
Also your description of ac_pubkey doesn't really explain how the "payments from the network" work

[28-Sep-18 11:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

It is explained in ``-ac_perc``, I can link or c/p. Thanks.

[29-Sep-18 12:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Is this a more correct decay formula?

```
reward_after_halving = reward_before_halving * ac_decay/100000000
```

Earlier, it was 
```
reward = (reward * ac_decay)/100000000
```
which wasn't making sense to me, but maybe I'm wrong.
