[27-Nov-18 02:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes exaclty

[27-Nov-18 02:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but at the moment it seems invalid invalid invalid

[27-Nov-18 02:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i do not need to worry

[27-Nov-18 02:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it will  sometime be mined 😃

[27-Nov-18 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[27-Nov-18 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
less UTXOs, more cores, and more stakers "should" fix you

[27-Nov-18 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If the dameon is back loggesd and cannot create the block in time, it wil be invalid.

[27-Nov-18 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this seems to be the case.

[27-Nov-18 02:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai  ill increase the cores

[27-Nov-18 02:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
17 minutes until the new block

[27-Nov-18 02:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
still

[27-Nov-18 02:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
going on

[27-Nov-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its definatly acked up ... if restart is fixing it ... you have too many utxos for the CPU to handle.

[27-Nov-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
good luck

[27-Nov-18 02:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
haha so @blackjok3r  ill

[27-Nov-18 02:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
increase the cores

[27-Nov-18 02:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[27-Nov-18 02:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it is the only possible solution for now

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ill upgrade

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes and maybe merge some utxo on one node only.

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the cpu cores

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so on 1 node

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
increase cores to 2.

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then send 50% of the balance to a single address

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
see hwo it goes

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that node keeps "unsticking" it

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
upgrade the other one

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ill increase the core

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean upgrade the core to 2 cores

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What it seems to be doing it mining to random address, did you split 10,000 utxos at the start?

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i used pos splitter though

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats an aweful lot

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that should not amke that many

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
in the start

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should onyl split over the 64 address

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the maixmum tx size is 2000 utxos

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you have 8000

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
from somwhere else

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are you using -pubkey=0xxx

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when you launch the daemon?

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i am on both

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and that key is not imported anywhere?

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] D.rabbani#9094
nodes using the pubkey

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm weird ...

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i havent imported the pubkey on any of the nodes

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just updgrade corees and see how it goes

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ill do it

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if might work for a while then stop again.

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if it work, we know what the sproblem is

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the next 2 weeks I will be workign on utxo managemnt scripts on block notify for PoS

[27-Nov-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its really needed...

[27-Nov-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or the nodes stop workign eventually, if they are minign nealry all the blocks, its just to omany tranactions fo them to handle.

[27-Nov-18 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in this case, a problem with adding script is that CPU is already overtaxed 😕

[27-Nov-18 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it would need to start with setgenerate false (imo)

[27-Nov-18 03:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can i ask you as you said less utxo will fix the issue how to do the less utxo ?

[27-Nov-18 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
consolidate all of them and then redistribute them

[27-Nov-18 07:00 PM] dukeleto#7326

[27-Nov-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto What am I missing? What is the "ASIC resistance" part?

[27-Nov-18 08:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i don't fully understand, but it's a turing complete language (almost reminds me of Brainfuck) where almost any random bits are valid code to execute. So an ASIC will have a very hard time being cheap to produce and efficient, since each random bitstring is a different valid program. Something like that

[27-Nov-18 08:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's being developed by XMR/CryptoNote people, they really dislike ASICs

[27-Nov-18 08:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is no fixed algorithm to make crazy fast in hardware, I think is what they are trying to utilize

[27-Nov-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh

[27-Nov-18 08:50 PM] osoese#0007
are ETH clones able to be on barterDEX yet - or still next quarter in the plans?

[27-Nov-18 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@osoese erc20 and eth are tradable on barterdex, yes!

[27-Nov-18 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Enable experimental features and add etomic

[27-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Hermes#6934
Hyperdex makes it a little bit easier to trade....if you are new to the DEX

[27-Nov-18 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*if you're not on "traditional" DSL

Everyone's claiming that it's malicious to sneak crypto mining code into an open source project, but maybe that's actually a decent way to fund its development

[28-Nov-18 07:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hi again sorry  i left the conversation last night can someone explain to me about UTXO's please i didnt get it about the distribution and all that stuff please

[28-Nov-18 07:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the problem is still there

[28-Nov-18 07:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when i restart the daemon it just simply build blocks

[28-Nov-18 07:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i am not getting the mechanism so that i can explain it further about utxo 😦

[28-Nov-18 07:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i am not sure why i need to split further ?

[28-Nov-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@D.rabbani I think I found an issue that might be causing this

[28-Nov-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what branch of komodo are you useing exactly?

[28-Nov-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and i8s this a CC enablled chain ie ac_cc=xx

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its a cc enabled  =1

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  but i also want to study about the UTXO's

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
please if you can help me out for this

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
as well

[28-Nov-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems uinrelated

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a bug in the code

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
oh 😮

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
my god

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
😮

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
atm since morning

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have started again

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
with zapwallettxes

[28-Nov-18 07:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
just on one node and other node i have started normalluy

[28-Nov-18 08:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
till now it is working as per yesterday it went off after 15 minutes

[28-Nov-18 08:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but it has been half an hour and the blocks are building up

[28-Nov-18 08:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
rapidly

[28-Nov-18 08:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so lets see how this goes

[28-Nov-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have had multiple nodes lock up mining, or staking at random times

[28-Nov-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but this could be something else... as we use a diffrent branch
