think a game like tetris

[22-Mar-19 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
multiplayers can play the same game

[22-Mar-19 10:35 PM] zack#6467
oh, is everyone competing for a high score?

[22-Mar-19 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Mar-19 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
winner wins all the buyins

[22-Mar-19 10:35 PM] zack#6467
ive been thinking that goofspiel would be a good game for blockchain gambling, because it is resistent to AI
Can AI dominate in rogue?

[22-Mar-19 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but the game is played locally

[22-Mar-19 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually AI will do well in rogue

[22-Mar-19 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but people are pretty good at it too, it is quite a complex game

[22-Mar-19 10:36 PM] zack#6467
maybe consider doing goofspiel next. I would love to play goofspiel on a blockchain

[22-Mar-19 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but nowadays google is beating starcraft pros

[22-Mar-19 10:37 PM] zack#6467
it is actually AI proof.

```Just because I want a hard update to happen doesn't mean I can get it to happen. Sometimes the mining pool operators make me set up a testnet first so they can try it out.```
does that mean that mining pool operators, let's say some that bought a false outcome can prevent you from hard forking to "truth"?

[22-Mar-19 10:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@zack take the plunge, do a game

[22-Mar-19 10:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
On kmd cc

[22-Mar-19 10:37 PM] zack#6467
im thinking of writing goofspiel into amoveo state channels. that way it would be actually trustless.

[22-Mar-19 10:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
🤦

[22-Mar-19 10:39 PM] jl777c#5810
wikipedia says: The game as defined by Ross, where payoffs are point differences, was solved using linear and dynamic programming in 2012.[4]

[22-Mar-19 10:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So its komodo that its trustless. Not utxo?

[22-Mar-19 10:39 PM] zack#6467
if AI is just going to win at rogue every time, it is hard to consider this a valid application.
But I think I get your point about the different levels of trust, and how blockchain can still be useful even if the mechanism isn't fully trustless.

[22-Mar-19 10:40 PM] Regnar#6164
so Zack, coming full circle, did Komodo lie?

[22-Mar-19 10:40 PM] jl777c#5810
well it is a proof of concept, and as a proof of concept it is very valid

[22-Mar-19 10:41 PM] zack#6467
@jl777c maybe you are looking at the wrong wikipedia. that is like saying that someone "solved" rock paper scissors.

[22-Mar-19 10:41 PM] zack#6467
any strategy has a counter-strategy that optimally beats it

[22-Mar-19 10:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is trustless, also, if it evolves into a bot wars arena, where it is provable which bot actually plays the best, this is value too

[22-Mar-19 10:42 PM] zack#6467
you can trivially beat Ross's suggested strategy by playing N+1.

There's no way for him to back-peddle that claim now without edits/deletions on multiple platforms

[22-Mar-19 10:42 PM] zack#6467
yeah, bot wars would be amazing

[22-Mar-19 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i view it as CPU mining in early days, ASIC mining eventually

[22-Mar-19 10:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm still waiting an answer to whether pool ops have a hold over you, like a board of directors, or not

[22-Mar-19 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so in the early days of the ROGUE chain you can earn coins playing against others

[22-Mar-19 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
later, it would just be the solo play, which is also possible

[22-Mar-19 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but the bots would be making most of the coins

that is why i keep asking @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[22-Mar-19 10:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
a straight forward answer with no fumbling would be ideal

[22-Mar-19 10:46 PM] zack#6467
I was wrong to call Komodo a scam and to say it was lying advertising.
The concept of trust is more complicated than I had thought.
There is pretty good evidence that there could be a situation where a mechanism is not fully trustless, but it still makes sense to use a blockchain to prevent further need for trust.

I just wish we could get some more concrete example than tetris vs AI.

Fair play @zack

[22-Mar-19 10:50 PM] zack#6467
the mining pool operators need to have miners to have any power.
If the rewards paid by a mining pool are worthless, then all the miners will leave. @mrlynch

[22-Mar-19 10:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
not what i asked

[22-Mar-19 10:51 PM] zack#6467
the mining pools don't have any control. they have to obey the miners to get any hashpower.

[22-Mar-19 10:51 PM] mrlynch#5735

[22-Mar-19 10:52 PM] zack#6467
no, the mining pool operator can't cause the Amoveo oracle to lie.

[22-Mar-19 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
peoples. give zack a break. he showed he is open minded and revised his position. having a manual hardfork is implicit in all blockchains, even BTC in case of a massive bug

`the mining pools don't have any control. they have to obey the miners to get any hashpower.`
This is the part where I come back in and ask if you actually know how mining and pools work 😕

if they arne't making profit, then they can't pay electricity, so they turn off eventually.

Cryptocurrency is very new. No shame in being wrong about things, only in failing to grow.

[22-Mar-19 10:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if they arne't making profit, then they can't pay electricity, so they turn off eventually.`
That accounts for less than 10% of miners

[22-Mar-19 10:55 PM] zack#6467
haha. yeah when the venezuela blackout happened, like 30% of Amoveo's hashpower disappeared. so I guess a lot of people have free electricity.

[22-Mar-19 10:55 PM] mrlynch#5735

it still costs something for the hardware

[22-Mar-19 10:56 PM] zack#6467
There are only 2 major pools in Amoveo, and they are both very supportive.

[22-Mar-19 10:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Deleted User he could just say so, not fumbling words

nice, @zack welcome to the community. If you like to mess around with blockchain tech, im sure you will have a great time here in komodo.

[22-Mar-19 11:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Like i said, @zack might have the little technicalities that would make bet cc something real.

[22-Mar-19 11:10 PM] zack#6467
I think you would have to change oracle cc a lot, or replace it with something else

[22-Mar-19 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe making an amoveo CC would make sense

[22-Mar-19 11:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[22-Mar-19 11:13 PM] zack#6467
Amoveo's oracle involves nakamoto consensus in a way that might not work for a network of blockchains like komodo.
I wasn't able to find a way to make Amoveo a part of Cosmos

[22-Mar-19 11:14 PM] zack#6467
for the oracle to work, it needs to be possible for Amoveo to split, and both sides of the split survive for a while.

[22-Mar-19 11:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that would be something really interesting to mix with dPOW

[22-Mar-19 11:15 PM] zack#6467
A simpler solution might be to just include an Amoveo light node as a dependency for the full nodes of one of your chains, and then you can use any oracle from Amoveo.

[22-Mar-19 11:15 PM] zack#6467
what is dPOW?

notaries multisign a proposed notarization

[22-Mar-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810

voting is KMD stake weighted

[22-Mar-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the game theory is that the big KMD holders want the better notary operators as that helps them the most and half the spots are up for election, the other half automatically reelected

[22-Mar-19 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810
people without any KMD can (and have) been elected to notaries

[22-Mar-19 11:29 PM] zack#6467
so the notaries periodically sign the root hash of an altcoin, and then write the root hash with all their signatures onto a bitcoin block?
It is a kind of sidechain system then?
