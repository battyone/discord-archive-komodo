you dont have to, but if you are looking for testing it can be done via KMD LABS. It needs to be submittted for integration to the test environment, and the chain will have CFEK prefix until testing is complete

[16-Apr-19 09:32 PM] t1#9168
Hello,
I tried to create an asset chain and run my two nodes. 
Working fine, but then I decided to stop the node 2 (mining) at block 54. 
I restarted the node after having added -addressindex=1 in the command. 
The node restarted to mine from block 1. why not from block 55?
And how can we check that both nodes are on the same chain (or taht node 2 has not split)?
Thank you!

[16-Apr-19 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`The node restarted to mine from block 1. why not from block 55?`
because you told it to generate blocks before syncing it to the other node

[16-Apr-19 09:41 PM] t1#9168
Thank you! Thus I have to restart the node with the  same long command without the -gen ?

[16-Apr-19 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes, only use -gen when you're certain to connect

[16-Apr-19 09:43 PM] t1#9168
When the node is sync, I do a ./komodod -gen?

[16-Apr-19 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=WHATEVERCHAIN setgenerate true 1`
the number being how many CPU threads

[16-Apr-19 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=WHATEVERCHAIN setgenerate false` will stop mining

[16-Apr-19 09:57 PM] t1#9168
excellent thank you

[17-Apr-19 02:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@t1 yes, the docs say use `-gen` but it's safer to use `setgenerate` after the daemon is loaded

[17-Apr-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@t1 also, when you add an index, it must reindex from block 1, it sounds like that is what you saw

[17-Apr-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
changing any index, adding or removing, will trigger a full reindex

[17-Apr-19 10:21 AM] t1#9168
Hello,
I am trying a 100% POS, and I used the pos64staker. 
until block 100 all ok: "mined block combined to ..." but from block 100 (end of mining)  I only get invalid blocks...

[17-Apr-19 10:30 AM] t1#9168
Ok it seems that all my 64 addresses are not staking because of being immature. 
Per default, how many blocks to have the maturity?

[17-Apr-19 10:44 AM] t1#9168
I guess it is 100. 
Ok now I got staking working, using mature coins.

[17-Apr-19 10:45 AM] t1#9168
And my remaining question is.... why staking is using 100% of the CPU? (having setgenerate true 0)

[17-Apr-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It just does, when there are no utxo eligible it won't use any CPU

[17-Apr-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still has to calculate an equihash solution for the block header even though its at zero diff that's not free.

[17-Apr-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@t1 funds in block 1 become mature in block 101

[17-Apr-19 11:16 AM] t1#9168
Thanks for your inputs!
And should I worry about this "error" 
"chain tip changed during staking "

[17-Apr-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
@t1 that is a pos-specific warning/error, I have never seen it, but my guess is @blackjok3r or @Alright knows what it means

[17-Apr-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
it sounds like a new block came in, and the staking algo had to restart

[17-Apr-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
but I don't know anything about that pos64 stuff

[17-Apr-19 11:27 AM] t1#9168
Thanks. Wondering if it is due to the fact that I have only 1 CPU

[17-Apr-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It means a block arrived so unreset the staking loop yes

[17-Apr-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Before I fixed that you would keep trying to stake an invalid block

[17-Apr-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181

if you ask him what is the right way, he will say use VEO

[19-Apr-19 12:26 AM] gcharang#6833
that is what I gathered after looking at the files

[19-Apr-19 07:23 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright can you tell me how to create an asset chain using a single node instead of two? I am going to document it this time üòÖ 
I assume one of the nodes need to change data dir, p2p and rpc ports, how to do that?

[19-Apr-19 08:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang custom p2p/rpc ports, and -datadir

[19-Apr-19 09:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang you can do it via CLI args or put it in the conf, or a combination

[19-Apr-19 09:05 AM] gcharang#6833
`./komodod -datadir=$HOME/TICKER/`
```bash
# Inside $HOME/TICKER/TICKER.conf
rpcport=something_otherthan_default
p2pport=something_otherthan_default
```
this should work?

[19-Apr-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
if those the correct config keys, yes, I think one may be `port`

[19-Apr-19 09:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
you will also need to tell the other node how to connect to the nonstandard ports of the other node

[19-Apr-19 09:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
run the seed node on normal params

[19-Apr-19 09:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
and make the mining node run on diff p2p/rpc ports, and have it connect to the standard ports of seed node

[19-Apr-19 09:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is less configuration

[19-Apr-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
other possibilities exist, I am trying to describe the "easiest to setup" and "less likely to maim people with strange bugs" way

[19-Apr-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
then you can `addnode=localhost` on the mining node

[19-Apr-19 09:08 AM] gcharang#6833
port in place of p2pport
> and have it connect to the standard ports of seed node
by specifying the port in the -addnode arg of the first node?

[19-Apr-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
the mining node with do `-addnode=localhost` , because the seed node is also on localhost

[19-Apr-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
not sure if localhost is a default, and maybe specifying port like -addnode=localhost:port is better, not sure.

[19-Apr-19 09:10 AM] gcharang#6833
how to let the first node know about the non standard p2p port of the minimg node?

[19-Apr-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
doing it on one node, strange bugs will most likely be run into

[19-Apr-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang mining node connects to seed node, not the other way around

[19-Apr-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
by giving `addnode` to the mining node, that tells it where to find the seed node

[19-Apr-19 09:11 AM] gcharang#6833
both have addnode in their launch?

[19-Apr-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
and then they are connected

[19-Apr-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
no, both don't, but both could

[19-Apr-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
mining node must addnode the seednode

[19-Apr-19 09:11 AM] gcharang#6833
got it, let me try

[19-Apr-19 09:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
it might be possible that you could do "seednode adds mining node" but I always do vice-versa. One must know about the other, somehow

[19-Apr-19 09:52 AM] gcharang#6833
thanks @dukeleto , its working. Will document the exact steps followed and post it here
