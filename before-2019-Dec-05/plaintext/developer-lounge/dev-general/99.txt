If the wallet was more corrupted it would take a diffrent path and likey fail to start, needing salvage wallet

[04-Jan-19 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it already does `CheckTransaction` on every txn in the wallet

[04-Jan-19 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, i see now. you are inspecting "invalid" xtns, but not necessarily "corrupt", like via HD failure

[04-Jan-19 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem was that the DB key is right, but the data that comes outs is garbage

[04-Jan-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when garbage is given to CheckTransaction it fails... üòÉ

[04-Jan-19 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
wallet.dat stores a lot of weird data for an xtn

[04-Jan-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you replace the txn... why rescan the entire chain ü§∑

[04-Jan-19 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
from my side, i have code that parses wallet.dat and inspects the data. xtn data has a variable size, there is a lot going on there

[04-Jan-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are stored in a key called "tx"<txid>""wtx data structure"

CMerkleTx is what is stored

[04-Jan-19 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, memo data is stored for zaddr xtns

[04-Jan-19 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
so much data in an xtn key

[04-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it clearly extracts a wtx data steructure object ... my code works.. ive tested it 10 times today on a 50mb wallet with 17 corrupted tx feilds.

[04-Jan-19 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
i could probably flip a bit somewhere and your code would not think it's invalid, but it's still corrupt

[04-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the code that checks if it corrupt or not was already ther...

[04-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just changed how it replaces the tx

[04-Jan-19 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, that salvage code come from btc core

[04-Jan-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of brute forcing a full rescan... replace the borken txn only

[04-Jan-19 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's cool code, i don't think you are doing anything wrong. It's just that most people never touch wallet.dat stuff üòÉ

[04-Jan-19 04:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
does it replace zaddr xtns correctly, with memo data?

[04-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well I lost maybe 20H or more fo my life waiting for wallet rescans

[04-Jan-19 04:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
or is that not part of your needs? I have no idea what bug is causing this stuff

[04-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its how the staker deletes staking txns when it reorgs

[04-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wasnt able to fix it

[04-Jan-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
neither was james in postest

[04-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so this is the only way to make it work realiably... its onyl an issue when yoiu have hundreds of thousands of txns

[04-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ztx is a tx

[04-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if GetTransaction can get it

[04-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then will be there

[04-Jan-19 04:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r very cool stuff

pretty sure i could make that remove any keys you wanted from the wallet, and give a new wallet, pretty easily. haven't done that yet

[04-Jan-19 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks. I think you mentiuoned this befoe and I lost it... I will save nookmark. might have saved me some time on this one to see what was wrong... this was one tricky bastrd to fix.

my next features to wack will be like nmap guessing your OS, I will guess the exact coin and version the wallet.dat came from. At first the problem seemed hard, but there are various tiny breadcrumbs left around the wallet.dat that actually allow you to tell which coin and which version of the coin the wallet.dat came from

[04-Jan-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
once we can guess the coin a wallet.dat came from, we can go ask blockexplorers "how much funds does address X have, if any?" and sum it all up, so we can have an automated tool that can look thru many wallet.dat (maybe corrupt, maybe old backups, etc) and tell you "this is how much transparent funds are in each of these wallets?". Will only work for transparent funds, but that is a feature, not a bug üòÉ

[04-Jan-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
it can already distinguish between ZEC/HUSH/KMD wallets

seems to be almost defaced with github comments, maybe reading via CLI is better

`git log -p --reverse`

I coded on C in university, but it were easy labs. Like a solve equitations system, or printing CLI tools. Will look trough it, thanks!

[05-Jan-19 08:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
very little in cryptoconditions is really c++, except what it inherits and must use. Like James says, it's mostly pure C

agree with James, just start basic C code to get started.
and gradually do CC stuff.

Started in iguana all pure C here also... C++ has far too many features to follow easily... I am slowly learning to understand what it does. Mostly just from reading other code ... I would likely be totally lost in any code base but komodod. Spent that many hours inside it reading... Can find most things and konw generally how data flows around.

[05-Jan-19 09:09 PM] Alright#0419
do a `getinfo` call the same way

via nodejs

do `importprivkey` via nodejs then try `validateaddress` again?

I *really* think you are sending the rpc command to a daemon that doesn't own the wallet. It doesn't make sense that rpc vs cli would return different results
