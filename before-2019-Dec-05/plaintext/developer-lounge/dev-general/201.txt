These fucking people don't know what they don't know

[10-Aug-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
actually how will a dusting attack against zaddr work?

[10-Aug-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the zaddr are not on chain

[10-Aug-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
only if you let your zaddr to be known can they send anything to it, but even then pretty sure they cannot see when you spend it

[10-Aug-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
as sender of dust, they will know the txid that is their dust tx, but when it is spent, that txid is not referenced

[10-Aug-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i do not see that what zcash says is 100% false, maybe there are some edge cases, but i dont even see those. once you send the funds, when it is spent, all you see is an encrypted blob, which looks like any other encrypted blob

[10-Aug-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
unlike XMR, dusting zcash is really not effective at all

[10-Aug-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
basically if zcash tech lets you see when a utxo you sent to someone else is spent again, well that wouldnt be very zero knowledge and it would be a severe flaw in privacy.

[10-Aug-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
which means you cant see when a utxo you send to someone else is being spent

[10-Aug-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
which makes dust attacks ineffective

[10-Aug-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe "impervious" is too strong a word as i can see the possibility of some massive dust attack combined with side channel surveillance, like seeing that your CPU usage is different from other CPU when scanning the encrypted blobs. but that requires your CPU state to be externally known to the attacker. though in the post-heartbleed days this is not an unthinkable possibility

[10-Aug-19 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c give me a zaddr of yours, and I will dust you?

[10-Aug-19 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
Zcash people give out zaddrs freely

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c also, isn't the Sapling Woodchipper a dusting attack against all zaddrs of an entire chain at once?

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
"impervious" is a very very strong word

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c let's say I scrape all Zcash mining pools that support zaddr payouts (there are only a few), then I can dust attack all pool miners that use zaddrs

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c let's say you only show me a txid

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, I will go look at your nullifier in the metadata not shown on the explorer

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
and if you ever every do a z->t xtn, to your self, because you must, to shield/unshield newly mined funds/etc, I will know a taddr in your wallet

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
And will just dust attack that

[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
`which means you cant see when a utxo you send to someone else is being spent` - I am not sure I understand this logic

[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't need to see that my target has spent any UTXOs I attack with

[10-Aug-19 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
All the above works against attacking Pirate zaddrs, and Hush zaddrs too

[10-Aug-19 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c unrelated, I was looking at main.cpp and see that `-maxmempool` and `-mempoolexpiry` CLI options were commented out. Was wondering why

[10-Aug-19 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
The logic "because you don't know one of my zaddrs, Zcash is impervious" does not follow

[10-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are not deanonymizing with dust attack?

[10-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the implication that you deanonymize with dust attack

[10-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
you are saying you can detect when i spend your dust via the nullifier?

[10-Aug-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
I never spoke of de-anonymization

[10-Aug-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
Dusting attack != de-anon, at least to me

[10-Aug-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
well dust attack implies that

[10-Aug-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
sending many 1sat xtns to a zaddr, what is that called?

[10-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
spam attack

[10-Aug-19 03:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
This is why every mathematician defines their own terms at the beginning of their paper

[10-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
all these dust attacks are in the context of deanonymizing

[10-Aug-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and a dust attack can deanonymize XMR, but not zcash

[10-Aug-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and you cant spam attack an address you dont know

[10-Aug-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
of course many mining pools display the zaddr and people even post them

[10-Aug-19 03:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
de-anonymizing dust attack, dust attack, spam attack, dwy attack, ugh

[10-Aug-19 03:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
terminology in this space is horrible

[10-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but an internal z->z will break any linkages

[10-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i agree that impervious is too strong

[10-Aug-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c if i know any metadata about your zaddr, like a nullifier, I can track you and maybe find it out based on your chain actions

[10-Aug-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, internal z2z breaks it

[10-Aug-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
but gosh, nobody even uses zaddrs to begin with on Zcash

[10-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and saying it is "100% wrong" is too strong

[10-Aug-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c I was talking about different kinds of attacks, differences in terminology

[10-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, just pointing out you are using the term "dust attack" differently than 90%+ of the rest

[10-Aug-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
I consider the Sapling Woodchipper a spam/dusting attack against a whole chain. amount=0 UTXOs are the definition of dust

[10-Aug-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
pure dust

[10-Aug-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
no value

[10-Aug-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
that i less that dust

[10-Aug-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
woodchipper goes into the spam attack category

[10-Aug-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not deanoymization

[10-Aug-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, there is the definition of "dust" via btc internals, 1/3rd of amount or something?

[10-Aug-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is better to be more precise

[10-Aug-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
so woodchipper is firmly in "spam attack", not "dust attack", ok

[10-Aug-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is a dust threshold

[10-Aug-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
I wasn't thinking of the difference between dust/spam, I guess they all fit into one spectrum for me

[10-Aug-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but the dust is used like cookies, to track and deanonymize

[10-Aug-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
and this attack against LTC, this dust attack. I thought it was a DoS

[10-Aug-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
what privacy do LTC user have to be taken?

[10-Aug-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
I know that in the past, LTC has been hit with massive 1sat attacks. 50% of the LTC UTXO set is 1sat utxos, iirc

[10-Aug-19 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
calling 1sat dust vs spam is very edge case, I agree that technically it's "spam" not "dust", according to BTC internal definition of "dust"

[10-Aug-19 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think we need better terminology

[10-Aug-19 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
"deanonymization attacks" and "dust attacks" didn't have the same exact meaning to me, but I see that is how it's used

[10-Aug-19 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am familiar with the de-anon stuff in XMR recently, and yes, Zcash doesn't have that exact problem

[10-Aug-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
Many coins won't allow spam, or under some sat value. Which means that "spam attacks" become "dust attacks"

[10-Aug-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
like on GAME, which has a huge min UTXO size

[10-Aug-19 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c I guess I need to find the proper dank meme to clarify all this on twitter. It's an art, not a science

[10-Aug-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
with LTC, chainanalysis (my guess) is trying to link KYC info with LTC addresses

[10-Aug-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
for all of the largest LTC addresses

[10-Aug-19 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
ah, so they are doing analysis on change addresses

[10-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you use QT wallet to send

[10-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it tends to grab whatever utxos are in the wallet

[10-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
including the dust and maybe from a different address

[10-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the moment you sign a tx that has vins from two different addresses, BAM! they are linked

{Reactions}
💥 

[10-Aug-19 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, BTC coin control has no user-visible knobs. It does really dumb stuff by default, regarding privacy

[10-Aug-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
over time, you might link all your wallet addresses, including the one you deposited to the exchange from

[10-Aug-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
bingo! KYC now applies to all your wallet addresses with very high degree of accuracy

[10-Aug-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
samaroui wallet claims to have some of the best coin control features around

[10-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
no need for any fancy analysis, just see where the dust got spent, look at all the other vin addresses, link them in the DB

[10-Aug-19 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
I will put forth that we need to differentiate between de-anonymizing dust attacks and DoS dust attacks (and both can be done at the same time)

[10-Aug-19 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c thanks for bringing up that I was using different words than the rest of the world. It happens, as a mathematician, more than you would think

[10-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
no problem, i try to point out technical errors when i see them, and sometimes (often?) the interpretation of words changes technical statements from valid <-> invalid

[10-Aug-19 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
we are inventing new words and concepts constantly, so it's no surprise that there are misunderstandings about the meanings of things

[10-Aug-19 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
src/main.cpp
4653:    //LimitMempoolSize(mempool, GetArg("-maxmempool", DEFAULT_MAX_MEMPOOL_SIZE) * 1000000, GetArg("-mempoolexpiry", DEFAULT_MEMPOOL_EXPIRY) * 60 * 60);
```

[10-Aug-19 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c any reason these CLI options are commented out?

[10-Aug-19 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is in the HUSH repo, so it's basically the FSM branch from a day or so ago

[10-Aug-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
did that change recently?

[10-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont remember the reasoning, maybe we needed to be able to have all tx in the mempool and limiting it would make mempools diverge a lot

[10-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the more the mempools are the same, the better

[10-Aug-19 03:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c seems reasonable. Maybe it snuck into a recent merge/etc. I didn't change it, and I don't need that feature. Mostly was curious
