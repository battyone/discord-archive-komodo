they want to embed what data?

[24-Apr-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
Thanks for this PR.

When the format for Sapling incoming viewing keys (section 5.6.6 of the protocol spec) was defined, I overlooked that there would not be sufficient information to tell which address it was meant for. We'll need to consider whether the external format should change in order to include that information, before merging this PR or equivalent.

Ahhh yes, that would be good to have

[24-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
it's not a hard fork or anything, is it?

[24-Apr-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
no

[24-Apr-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is RPC level stuff

[24-Apr-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's like a new kind of private key, which is only for sapling zaddrs and only gives you "watchonly" access to incoming xtns

[24-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
new format can be <view key><z addr> üòÇ

[24-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Alright#0419
why does it need to be "embedded"

[24-Apr-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright can't tell which level of irony or trolling you are on üòÖ

[24-Apr-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright what you describe is very similar, just very wasteful of space

[24-Apr-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
bech32 representation of something takes more bytes than storing a pubkey as a 64bit int in a special way, then doing one base58/bech32 of the whole thing

[24-Apr-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c anywhere you want to use an IVK, you will need to store zaddr+IVK, does that work for your needs?

[24-Apr-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
we are worried about space when the current state is not having any way of doing it

[24-Apr-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be used in atomic swaps, which will need to include chain, zaddr, etc

[24-Apr-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c and you plan to store all that in the memo field, yes?

[24-Apr-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
each use case would need to simply store it, like if  a wallet uses it, it should put it in the wallet

[24-Apr-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is plenty of room there, it's unused space in most transactions

[24-Apr-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
makes sense to keep everything in the memo, including ordermatch details

[24-Apr-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought something was horribly broken and that is why it wasnt merged

[24-Apr-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
this just means that it requires the caller to track some extra data. seems one of the sillier reasons to not have what is basically a critically needed functionality

[24-Apr-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
with this, you can also prove you sent payments

[24-Apr-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
Last official word: `We'll need to consider whether the external format should change in order to include that information, before merging this PR or equivalent.`

[24-Apr-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
so Zcash needs to consider whether the format *should* change

[24-Apr-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
They didn't give the author of the PR any direction at all

[24-Apr-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
that was 2 months ago, the PR just gets more stale

[24-Apr-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
we should thank the author for a perfectly usable viewing kyes

[24-Apr-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
This is pretty standard zec behavior. They often let my trivial commits sit for months while they decide about minutiae

[24-Apr-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c worst case is that ZEC comes out with an amazing new IVK format, and we upgrade to that. I agree with you, let's use this, it's very nice

[24-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember seeing something about being able to efficiently detect incoming amounts to a large number of different addresses

[24-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
do you know about that?

[24-Apr-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c maybe, describe it a bit more?

[24-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
currently if your wallet has 10,000 addresses, it is very slow to detect incoming amounts

[24-Apr-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
"diversified addresses" are a thing, I don't know if those have been merged

[24-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, what is it?

[24-Apr-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, "diversified addresses"

[24-Apr-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
let me make sure I use the correct terminology

[24-Apr-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c basically, it's BIP32 for sapling, called ZIP32: https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/zip-0032.rst

[24-Apr-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's recently merged, but I don't think it's being fully utilized

[24-Apr-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
the TLDR is this: It means you can give out a unique shielded address, that can't be linked to any other zaddr

[24-Apr-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
but has the same private key as your "main zaddr"

[24-Apr-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think. Please correct me if I am wrong.

[24-Apr-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is more efficient to see if funds came in from a bunch of addresses?

[24-Apr-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see it

[24-Apr-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is just bip32, you would still need to check all the different addresses

[24-Apr-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
Many diversified addresses can map to one IVK, is one thing

[24-Apr-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
so that means you import one IVK but listen to N diversified addresses

[24-Apr-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't know about performance implications

[24-Apr-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
and docs about this stuff is almost non-existent

[24-Apr-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, then you can tell a deposit came into one of the addresses, but then wouldnt it be needed to scan all addresses, or there is some extra data in the ivk that shows which diversified address? i guess we need to wait for docs

[24-Apr-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c that is what I was talking about, if you don't know which diversified address, you have to do a full scan. There are no docs, in the spec or code, currently

$KMD and $HUSH have merged support for Zcash Sapling incoming view keys (IVKs) thanks to @radix42 carrying an elderly + abandoned Github PR thru the desert from $ZEC world.
Things persisted in not being what they seemed.

[24-Apr-19 02:12 PM] scubapanda#2485
@dukeleto Sorry if this is a trivial question but I didn't get the point of incoming viewing key keeping track of the address it's related to. How would one do this? Wouldn't this only be useful if you have the private/spending key in the wallet already? To find out which addresses the viewing key is good for, without the private key already in the wallet, you'll always have to scan the chain to see which transactions it matches? If the private key, matching this viewing key, is already there, can't you then just check which one of these existing private keys it 'matches' - if any.

ehr ma gherd, this will make my life sooo much easier

[24-Apr-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@scubapanda not sure you understand. This is like "watchonly" addresses for shielded addresses

[24-Apr-19 03:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Decker `1. libcurl.mk now changed to build against static openssl from deps.` - pretty sure this broke the os x build

no idea what that means though lol

that's the condition triggering it though

[25-Apr-19 12:20 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
maybe because the incoming UTXO over the 30day cap something needs to be different about my block?
or an issue in the latest dev branch?

[25-Apr-19 01:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ finalized transactions, oh the joy

[25-Apr-19 01:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright that means "set nSequence to the largest value allowed to be stored in a uint32_t"

[25-Apr-19 01:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
I didn't know about "finalized" until recently, it's really low level stuff, below the level of confirmations

[25-Apr-19 01:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ non-finalized means the transaction does not meet the requirements for timestamps and median blocktimes and it all gets very hairy

[25-Apr-19 01:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's not a bug in your code, sounds like funky timestamps that were by accident or perhaps somebody playing with timewarp attacks

[25-Apr-19 01:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
`IsFinalTx()` in src/main.cpp has a printf you can uncomment to get more debug data

[25-Apr-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
do we have a "go-to" repo for insight?

Hey all, I asked over in mining and got an answer I didn't think was sufficient.  Anyone know why the -mineraddress flag doesn't work?  Is it true we need to use the -pubkey?

[25-Apr-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
it's deprecated

[25-Apr-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
use pubkey, it has basically the same effect

what is it you're trying to do?

[25-Apr-19 03:42 AM] NickH#5815
We (Luxor) run nodes in multiple regions and provide the address of the wallet in the payment processor node.  We weren't seeing the blocks found in other regions showing up in the payment processor's wallet, and found that the coinbase is being sent to a different wallet address

[25-Apr-19 03:42 AM] NickH#5815
Alright, pubkey it is

[25-Apr-19 03:42 AM] NickH#5815
Thanks!

[25-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
Not sure I understand

[25-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
your stratum should be dictating the address it mines to, no?

We use the coinbasetx provided in the GBT.

Until now, hadn't had an occasion to write the serialization logic for generating our own Coinbase

that address has been mining < 3 KMD block rewards for some reason
