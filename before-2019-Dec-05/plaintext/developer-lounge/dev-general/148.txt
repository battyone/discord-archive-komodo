OK, so at the point that you're trolling with an obvious flaw in your logic/claim and refusing to answer because you know there is no answer, I'm going to go to work now knowing that you're just butthurt because you found out that you have market-share issues and rather than make a better product you thought it'd be better to attempt to FUD someone else

In Amoveo we have cryptoeconomic guarantees that the data is valid. 
I explained about the hard  updates a couple times already, but it is so far up to scroll

[22-Mar-19 09:29 PM] sφldat#8733
Maybe we need an oracle answer

[22-Mar-19 09:29 PM] zack#6467
im thinking ill put it into a document in Amoveo, and come back with a link. so I don't have to keep rewriting this

[22-Mar-19 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I explained about the hard updates a couple times already,`
At no point did you ever show how you provide "cryptoeconomic guarantees" that the manual "hard upgrades" you place on an oracle "about to lie" are not maliciously manipulated by you (as a centralized entity).

[22-Mar-19 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If/when you do document 👆🏽 that, absolutely tag me when you drop the link

My favorite quote from the whitepaper 
`If the oracle lied, then the users could do a hard-fork to fix the oracle's answer.`

sorry for the delays guys. I feel like I need to prioritize jl777's questions, he seems to be good at technology.

[22-Mar-19 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
your writeup still has the retirement attack vuln

[22-Mar-19 09:52 PM] zack#6467
for the developer?

[22-Mar-19 09:52 PM] Regnar#6164
first of all. `If no one is betting in the oracle, then maybe no one will notice it closing incorrectly. But since no one has money at risk, it doesn't matter if it closes incorrectly.` how do you know NO ONE has money to risk? The data is being used for something, just because you don't have bets going that you see, doesn't mean that other's aren't relying on the "truthfulness" of your oracle data

[22-Mar-19 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
"If I lied and tricked the community into doing an update that let me steal some money, this would destroy my reputation with them, and it would become vastly more difficult for me to get more updates into Amoveo in the future." <- if you retire with enough loot then this is not a deterrent

This is a good time for @zack to collaborate with @jl777c on bet cc

[22-Mar-19 09:53 PM] zack#6467
yes, Amoveo bets are all off-chain in the state channels. so it is impossible for us to know if no one has money at risk.
It is easy to know if you personally have money at risk, and if you do, it is easy to speak up and get the situation resolved.

[22-Mar-19 09:54 PM] Regnar#6164
"get the situation resolved"

[22-Mar-19 09:54 PM] Regnar#6164
by that you mean, appeal to you?

[22-Mar-19 09:54 PM] jimboSlice#5216
if you use futarchy for updates a developer cannot do a retirement attack FYI

[22-Mar-19 09:54 PM] MyName#0491
`The network decides the outcome of oracles by hard forking the code.`
Which means that a centralized entity has to be trusted to determine what outcomes are/aren't valid
Back to the grass example:
The outcome is "grass is blue", consensus decides that to be a "lie"
The centralized entity must be trusted to provide a "grass is green" option to fork to
If the centralized entity only provides "grass is red" and the existing "grass is blue", then the network will fork to "grass is red" and still not hold "truth"

[22-Mar-19 09:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
```If someone is betting in the oracle, then they have an incentive to keep an eye on it and notice if it is closing incorrectly. ```
that is a dangerous assumption.. we all know that passive whale

[22-Mar-19 09:55 PM] zack#6467
@jl777c  yes,  i can probably still do a single retirement attack.
But if I did, the network would learn, and it would be harder for any developer to do this again.

the problem is that I am just too trustworthy.
I should do some bad things so that Amoveo community will stop trusting my updates and it will be more secure.

[22-Mar-19 09:55 PM] zack#6467
What bad things should I do?

[22-Mar-19 09:56 PM] jl777c#5810

that didn't stop all those exit scams from happening.. your argument is invalid, try again

[22-Mar-19 09:56 PM] zack#6467
The ability to do an attack once and the network learns, that is different from a vulnerability that can happen again and again.

[22-Mar-19 09:56 PM] jl777c#5810
your position that everything blockchain related must be fully trustless is quite an extreme position. clearly all the assets that are issued require trust in the issuers, and duke is right trustlessness is a spectrum. To say only the extreme endpoint is valid, is invalid.

[22-Mar-19 09:56 PM] Regnar#6164
I think everyone is giving you very real and valid thoughts, honestly this type of critique is hard to come by, if it's a valid comment you should seriously consider your answers

[22-Mar-19 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a place for tokenized crypto, so much so there are bitshares exchanges charging 3BTC to tokenize your coin to trade on the DEX

[22-Mar-19 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and i think the gateways arent even multisig

[22-Mar-19 09:57 PM] mrlynch#5735

there is a lot of trustful mechanisms out there today

[22-Mar-19 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so by his logic, the entire amoveo chain has no purpose

[22-Mar-19 09:58 PM] zack#6467
financial derivatives is the purpose

[22-Mar-19 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
which I dont agree with as that is very extremist

[22-Mar-19 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
just because a blockchain project has some aspects of trust required doesnt mean you can just use a centralized solution

[22-Mar-19 09:59 PM] zack#6467
Bitcoin software had security holes. But when they were discovered they were patched up.
Vulnerabilities that can happen just once aren't so threatening to the success of a blockchain in comparison to the ones that happen over and over.

[22-Mar-19 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and I would hope he is mature enough to stop saying that we are lying, when we never even claim we are trustless in the firstplace

[22-Mar-19 10:00 PM] MyName#0491
`I should do some bad things so that Amoveo community will stop trusting my updates and it will be more secure.`
Your hyperbole and sarcasm aside, are you willing to no longer be involved and just walk away if the network decides the outcome of oracles by hard forking the code to code you don't control?

[22-Mar-19 10:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
a full on exit scam is a pretty threatening thing and so far it seems that you hold the keys to the kingdom

[22-Mar-19 10:00 PM] zack#6467
Can you give me an example of a use case where it isn't completely trust-free, but you still get enough advantages from the blockchain that it is better to put it on a blockchain instead of a centralized website?

[22-Mar-19 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
amoveo

[22-Mar-19 10:01 PM] zack#6467
Amoveo is trust free

[22-Mar-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810

[22-Mar-19 10:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
no it's not

Can you give me an example that I can understand?

[22-Mar-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810

notice the usage of "stop trusting"

It seems like you can't come up with any example

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
4th time 👆  do you need 15 min more for another write up?

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the tokenized DEX is a simple example

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it at least blockchains the trades

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so gives visibility into the trades, even though you still trust the gateways to redeem your coins

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] zack#6467
can you tell me more about this?
Some bitcoin are locked somewhere, and then bitcoin tokens are on Komodo?

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a half step

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
cryptobridge?

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
bitshares

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] zack#6467
like a bitcoin placeholder that can be turned back into bitcoin?

[22-Mar-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
NXT

[22-Mar-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, gateways

[22-Mar-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
you deposit crypto in a gateway, get a token 1:1

[22-Mar-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can redeem it 1:1 for the real crypto

[22-Mar-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
in between you can do onchain swaps with other tokens

[22-Mar-19 10:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
or "financial derivatives" that match value of btc

[22-Mar-19 10:04 PM] zack#6467
Does that have any advantages over synthetic assets?
It seems like a less secure version of the same.

[22-Mar-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a blockchain involved, trading things onchain, yet you are trusting the gateway to redeem

[22-Mar-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt capped at 100%

[22-Mar-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the real coins

[22-Mar-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and the main advantage is that all the trades are onchain

[22-Mar-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
along with orders

[22-Mar-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can detect that there is no cheating, this is not possible on CEX

[22-Mar-19 10:06 PM] zack#6467
the people who run the bridge, why don't they run a centralized website and hold your bitcoin the same way?
Why do you want the bitcoin-tokens on komodo, if you are trusting that group of people anyway?

[22-Mar-19 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the exposure on the deposited coins is just as bad as a CEX, i dont count that as an advantage

[22-Mar-19 10:06 PM] zack#6467
oh, it is to make the trading mechanism less trusted

Since they are holding the same money anyway?
