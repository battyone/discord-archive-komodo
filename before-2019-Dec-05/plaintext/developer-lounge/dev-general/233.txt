Delete chain data on the main node, and start over with correct params

[28-Oct-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can wipe all the nodes, you can use the same symbol

ANyone here who can help me diagnose a bug in the aarch64 quickly i have a question

[28-Oct-19 07:47 PM] Chris - Monkins#5278
someone know knows about the structures?

@Ecosystem Developer

[28-Oct-19 07:50 PM] Chris - Monkins#5278
```c
ec = type_descriptor->op->der_encoder(type_descriptor,
        struct_ptr,    /* Pointer to the destination structure */
        0, 0, encode_to_buffer_cb, &arg);```  debugging through and getting into SEQUENCE_encoder_der.  what im putting in doesnt appear in the subroutine where i read the variables passed in

[28-Oct-19 07:50 PM] Chris - Monkins#5278
when im in ```c
SEQUENCE_encode_der(asn_TYPE_descriptor_t *td, const void *sptr,
                    int tag_mode, ber_tlv_tag_t tag,
                    asn_app_consume_bytes_f *cb, void *app_key)```

[28-Oct-19 07:51 PM] Chris - Monkins#5278
i get `tag_mode == 1447051265` and `ber_tvl_tag_t = 127`

[28-Oct-19 07:52 PM] Chris - Monkins#5278
im guessing the structure of the `der_type_encoder_f` is not calulating the structure alignment correctly

What can the antara gaming sdk be used for? Ive looked through the tic-tac-toe tutorial and it didn't mention blockchain integration

[01-Nov-19 07:54 AM] Audo#5667
I think those are just teasers. The SDK is still in development and hasn't been released yet.

[01-Nov-19 11:13 PM] phm87#7395
Do we have an ac_param or a param to create smartchains with merge mining ?
When a block of a sha coin with huge difficulty is found on a pool with merged mining enabled, all coins with merge mining on sha with lower difficulty will have a block. The merged mined coins accept as valid the hash of the coin with higher difficulty. Merge mining is also fun (on doge: <https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/search?l=C%2B%2B&q=merge+mining>)

[01-Nov-19 11:33 PM] phm87#7395
there are many coins with merged mining (but mostly on sha and scrypt). But I heard only about GLT on equihash (<https://github.com/globaltoken/globaltoken/blob/master/src/rpc/mining.cpp#L1416>)

[02-Nov-19 11:20 PM] phm87#7395
I think that such an ac_param doesn't exist. We discussed merge mining few months ago. Merge mining can be an added value to have blocks with a nearly 0 cost (see explanation above) so less risk of stalled chains. But any attack on merged mined coins have also a 0 cost. Dpow with merge mining can be good then.

Merge mining + AdaptivePoW

[02-Nov-19 11:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seems would work well

[02-Nov-19 11:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[02-Nov-19 11:51 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Merge mining + AdaptivePoW`
seems even sillier that mergeming to me
I never understood the appeal of mergeming, other than "free" income from garbage chains that miners wouldn't otherwise even touch

[03-Nov-19 12:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Piggybacking hashrate off a more popular coin has its merits for small chains.  Merge Mining has been used to diff stall a chain before so that‚Äôs why I added APoW

[03-Nov-19 12:44 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If a chain has enough merit to mine than diff stalls should be rare, if ever

[03-Nov-19 01:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I agree,Still gotta be prepared for the rare though ,  it‚Äôs a non negligible probability scenario .   A major pool suddenly discontinuing merge mining during a period of unusually increased hashrate with the auxpow chain having a crappy DAA could cause a stall.    But your point about merit is correct, if the chain is worthwhile it will survive until the difficulty corrects itself with dedicated miners.  Just not a confidence builder for those relying on a somewhat stable transaction processing.

[03-Nov-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
mergemining requires a block header change and a fair amount of work. it doesnt really add much value when we already have dPoW and aPoW

[03-Nov-19 04:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That and Verus is already pursuing that route.  No need to reinvent the wheel, too much on our plate already

@grewalsatinder thanks! I'm still pretty new at sharing work online or using github with other people so hopefully I'm doing these commits/pr correctly. I'm just editing my initial pull request (until it is accepted) adding PoCs as I get them from people

[04-Nov-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Regnar excellent! keep up good work mate. I'll try to join you with my old software stack of Node.js + jQuery based PoC soon
a bit busy with another project doing with a friend.

[04-Nov-19 01:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c I find that there's need for GUIs and intro tutorials for new devs for CC. Will try to do that.
even in case I see node.js and jQuery as old, and not as good as native languages like C/go/Dart/Flutter etc. since I know and have practice on these stack, at least giving something to community of devs or even to users to test these in graphical way will sure help.
I guess just like my old work helped at least people test the in progress projects.

[04-Nov-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, more proof of concepts GUI will be very good

Hi all! New Komodo dev here. I am attempting to run the install procedure for macOS here: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/installing-from-source.html#macos
I am at the step for compiling Komodo via this command `./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8
`
But am getting an error: `configure: error: cannot find a C99-compatible compiler`
Is gcc-8 not a C99-compatible compiler?
