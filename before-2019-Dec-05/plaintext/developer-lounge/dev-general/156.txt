so the hivemind seems like the only other robust solution? I like your approach but I am not sure how things converge to Reality without external arbiter

[23-Mar-19 04:51 PM] zack#6467
well, when I apply the theory of trust paper I wrote today, I am calculaing that hivemind is 3.1

[23-Mar-19 04:51 PM] zack#6467
it isn't as good as I had thought

[23-Mar-19 04:51 PM] zack#6467
Amoveo is still 1.1

[23-Mar-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
can you explain how false data is rejected in your system?

[23-Mar-19 04:52 PM] zack#6467
In Amoveo we have a basic assumption that if the network forks, the more honest side will have higher valued tokens.

[23-Mar-19 04:52 PM] zack#6467
we can use that price difference as the ultimate arbiter

[23-Mar-19 04:53 PM] zack#6467
then we have lots of tricks to make it scalable

[23-Mar-19 04:53 PM] zack#6467
it is a nakamoto consensus based oracle

[23-Mar-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the miners dont seem to be paying attention to the state of the oracle

[23-Mar-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
or are they somehow and I missed that part

[23-Mar-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of the oracles end up not going to true or false

[23-Mar-19 04:54 PM] zack#6467
our scalability tricks protect the miners from having to pay attention in almost every case

[23-Mar-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so i create an oracle "Mar 23 2019 is a Tuesday"

[23-Mar-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what happens next?

[23-Mar-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
attacker wants this to be true

[23-Mar-19 04:55 PM] zack#6467
oh, so for this example, lets say that I commit to paying you $1000, if the on-chain result of the oracle is "true"

[23-Mar-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
this payment is combined with the creation of the oracle or is it a "side bet"?

[23-Mar-19 04:56 PM] zack#6467
your best strategy is to do nothing, because if you waste money in the oracle it doesn't increase you odds of getting the $1000

[23-Mar-19 04:56 PM] zack#6467
its enforced by a handshake based on our mutual respect

[23-Mar-19 04:57 PM] zack#6467
if you try making bets in the oracle, it escalates the situation.
It creates a prize for others to come and bet against you

[23-Mar-19 04:57 PM] zack#6467
the ability to escalate is what makes it so scalable

[23-Mar-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so someone bets $1 that it is true, this pushes it towards true?

[23-Mar-19 04:58 PM] zack#6467
https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/design/oracle.md I wrote about the Amoveo oracle here

[23-Mar-19 04:58 PM] zack#6467
the betting mechanism is just for escalating the situation to the point where the miners have an incentive to pay attention

[23-Mar-19 04:58 PM] zack#6467
it doesn't actually determine the outcome

[23-Mar-19 04:59 PM] zack#6467
the betting mechanism  is also how you can decide which side of the fork you want your money to be on.

[23-Mar-19 04:59 PM] zack#6467
making bets on the false outcome is the same as saying you want to move your money to the less valuable side when it forks.

[23-Mar-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! "The first order in the book needs to be as big as the initial liquidity. Every order after that needs to be twice as big as the previous order."

[23-Mar-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so the cost grows exponentially to flip it.

[23-Mar-19 05:02 PM] zack#6467
that is only when you add orders to the book. if you are matching an existing order, it doesn't have to grow like that

[23-Mar-19 05:02 PM] zack#6467
and if the number of orders in the book decreases, the limit decreases

[23-Mar-19 05:02 PM] zack#6467
it is to stop the datastructure from getting so big and making txs take too long in edge cases

[23-Mar-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
where is the orderbook details documented, this seems the key to why this works

[23-Mar-19 05:03 PM] zack#6467
https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/design/transaction_types.md
the oracle txs type deal with the order book

[23-Mar-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
having everything being even odds, i guess that just makes the questions needing to be 50/50 type of odds to get optimal volumes

[23-Mar-19 05:06 PM] zack#6467
yeah, the order book is super simple this way. it only stores one kind of trade at a time.

[23-Mar-19 05:06 PM] zack#6467
well, we aren't trying to get volume

[23-Mar-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking how do the miners choose the winning fork?

[23-Mar-19 05:06 PM] zack#6467
we just want to measure if theh price is above below 50-50

[23-Mar-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
at some point it seems they need to answer the question themselves or ask someone else to do it for them

[23-Mar-19 05:07 PM] zack#6467
currently, miners make that choice by deciding which version of the full node to run

[23-Mar-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
what if there are hundreds of oracles per day?

[23-Mar-19 05:08 PM] zack#6467
the nash equilibrium for every individual oracle is that the miner will never have to think about it.

[23-Mar-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
combinatorial explosion of forks, or whoever runs the reference version is basically determining the accuracy

[23-Mar-19 05:08 PM] zack#6467
the cost of escalating an oracle to the point where a miner would have to care is very expensive. probably tens of thousands of dollars at first, and it will get more expensive every time you do it.

[23-Mar-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok so back to the mar 23 is tuesday oracle, it has $1 saying its true

[23-Mar-19 05:09 PM] zack#6467
people will see the profit opportunity and bet against you to prevent you from causing mischief

[23-Mar-19 05:09 PM] zack#6467
I would be willing to bet up to all the VEO I own against you

[23-Mar-19 05:09 PM] zack#6467
if you kept upping the bets

[23-Mar-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a sidebet of $1000

[23-Mar-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but if nobody bothered for the $1, it becomes the value of true?

[23-Mar-19 05:10 PM] zack#6467
if no one makes any bets, and no one alerts the miners or the miners don't care, then it would resolve to true

[23-Mar-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
then any offchain sidebets are resolved improperly...

[23-Mar-19 05:11 PM] zack#6467
I happen to know that you have a vested interest, so I would bet the $1 against you in the hope you would keep upping it and I could earn even more

[23-Mar-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so you fill my order for $1, now there is $2 onchain at stake and no orders

[23-Mar-19 05:12 PM] zack#6467
if someone has an offchain bet on the result of the oracle, usually they take their money out of the bet as soon as they know the result. which is long before the oracle resolves

[23-Mar-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
then it would resolve to bad question

[23-Mar-19 05:12 PM] zack#6467
you can't completely get rid of the financial incentive, because the initial liquidity cost of making the oracle initially, that becomes the final bet in the market. and it always bets on the losing side.

[23-Mar-19 05:13 PM] zack#6467
so you can always earn at least that much my changing it from incorrect to correct

[23-Mar-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i noticed that, it bets on the losing side, so actually posting false oracle means you get your money back?

[23-Mar-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, somebody else would bet on it being false to collect the free money

[23-Mar-19 05:14 PM] zack#6467
right

[23-Mar-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and the losing side becomes that it was true!

[23-Mar-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
very clever

[23-Mar-19 05:15 PM] zack#6467
the oracle initial fee is a governance variable. the community can use futarchy to change it

[23-Mar-19 05:15 PM] zack#6467
it used to be higher, now it is very low

[23-Mar-19 05:15 PM] zack#6467
maybe it is too low now

[23-Mar-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems expensive if it is $1.50

[23-Mar-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
not practical for a once per minute data stream

[23-Mar-19 05:16 PM] zack#6467
you ask the oracle what the price of bitcoin will be in a month, once.
Then you can trade assets who are determined by that oracle for the entire duration of that month

[23-Mar-19 05:16 PM] zack#6467
each oracle provides 1 bit of data

[23-Mar-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but I want to have things like the price of bitcoin on Mar 23 at 1200 GMT was $4000

[23-Mar-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and having a minute by minute update so we can get data for trading charts

[23-Mar-19 05:17 PM] zack#6467
so you don't need to trust some guy who makes promises about what the current price of bitcoin is.
Instead you can just buy some synthetic bitcoin, knowing that they will have the right price because of incentives.

[23-Mar-19 05:18 PM] zack#6467
why would you want to push untrusted trading chart data through a blockchain? 
just make a normal website with a trading chart

[23-Mar-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
accurate price data is very valuable

[23-Mar-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so a trustless price data would be very very useful

[23-Mar-19 05:19 PM] zack#6467
a trusted feed doesn't have guarantees of accuracy

[23-Mar-19 05:19 PM] zack#6467
you can find out the current price by going to a market

[23-Mar-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
unless each data point was an oracle

[23-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no single price, it is statiscal distribution

[23-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
and depends on volume

[23-Mar-19 05:20 PM] zack#6467
Price is usually a field. goods change value by location.

[23-Mar-19 05:21 PM] zack#6467
like temperature

[23-Mar-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so we start getting into ambiguous oracle questions, with a strict exact price, it could reasonably be both true or false

[23-Mar-19 05:21 PM] zack#6467
the price of bitcoin would be expressed as a 10 bit value. each bit from a different oracle

[23-Mar-19 05:22 PM] zack#6467
as long as oracle questions are useful in 99% of cases, it doesn't matter if 1% is ambiguous.

[23-Mar-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so i guess the oracle statement would need to have a +/- error factor to make it less ambiguous

[23-Mar-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the median price would be 50% ambiguous

[23-Mar-19 05:23 PM] zack#6467
the oracle question is in english, you can ask whatever you want

[23-Mar-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so what happens with the bitcoin price was exactly $4000? bets on either side is reasonable

[23-Mar-19 05:23 PM] zack#6467
there price of VEO is very different on the different exchanges. It isn't completely clear how the lower bits of the oracle should resolve

[23-Mar-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
(assume current median price is $4000)

[23-Mar-19 05:24 PM] zack#6467
if you ask whether bitcoin is above/below $4000,  but it is exactly at $4000, I think that it doesn't matter which way the oracle resolves. Either is fine.

[23-Mar-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
how do you prevent a chain split in the case of big money on both sides of the 50% ambiguous oracle?

[23-Mar-19 05:25 PM] zack#6467
When you hedge your risk, these super rare instances aren't so important.
Hedging 99% of your risk is a lot better than 0%

Just because you can't get 100% doesn't mean you should go with 0%.

[23-Mar-19 05:25 PM] zack#6467
Why would people invest lots of money in an ambiguous result?

[23-Mar-19 05:26 PM] zack#6467
just to see what would happen?
