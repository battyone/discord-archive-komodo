[09-Jan-19 07:16 PM] jorian#4555
or maybe i did it wrong

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian which version of perl and BerkeleyDB are you using?

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am using BerkeleyDB 0.55

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
version of perl shouldn't really matter, but could

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] jorian#4555
This is perl 5, version 22, subversion 1 (v5.22.1) built for x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, that is recent

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am on v5.18.2 from the stoned ages

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] jorian#4555
lol

[09-Jan-19 07:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
`unsupported btree version: 10` is odd

[09-Jan-19 07:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian which version of BerkeleyDB perl module?

[09-Jan-19 07:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
which is different from the version of bdb on your system

[09-Jan-19 07:18 PM] jorian#4555
first 0.55, which is latest i think

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, that is what I am on

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] jorian#4555
i did ```perl -MCPAN -e shell
install BerkeleyDB```

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is good/reasonable

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] jorian#4555
first steps in perl world

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think maybe the perl mod is finding the wrong/different system bdb than you suppose

[09-Jan-19 07:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you have multiple versions installed, maybe that you use --prefix= to point other things at?

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jorian#4555
how can i check that

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
how did you install bdb? source code? or system packages?

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jorian#4555
ok wait

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jorian#4555
i think i'm missing something hten

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jorian#4555
i thought the perl module would install all bdb

[09-Jan-19 07:20 PM] jorian#4555
but it actually uses system BDB?

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
Perl BerkeleyDB is just a wrapper, it talks to your installed bdb

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] jorian#4555
aha

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
BerkeleyDB is a perl wrapper for the C library, basically

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian which coin created the wallet.dat you are trying to look at?

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] jorian#4555
MGNX, komodod

[09-Jan-19 07:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, those are supported

[09-Jan-19 07:23 PM] jorian#4555
i guess i need 4.8?

[09-Jan-19 07:24 PM] jorian#4555
but if komodo uses these, then how can your wack not use it?

[09-Jan-19 07:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian the system bdb needs to be able to read the wallet.dat files that you want to read with wack, basically

[09-Jan-19 07:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian trying to figure out which bdb i have, because that is all i have tested with

[09-Jan-19 07:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
it sounds like you have a bdb that is new and doesn't want to open old formats

[09-Jan-19 07:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
4.8.30 is what I have, I think

[09-Jan-19 07:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian it may be possible to install 2 bdb's, and then use an environment variable to make wack find the one you want

[09-Jan-19 07:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not sure if any cryptocoins use the new bdb formats, not supporting old formats is just weird to me

[09-Jan-19 07:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian thanks for testing things out, I will explain some of this better in the readme

[09-Jan-19 07:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
something like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/where/is/bdb-4.8 ./wack

[09-Jan-19 07:32 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[09-Jan-19 07:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
i actually have 2 bdb's and I am not 100% sure which is being used

[09-Jan-19 07:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
$ brew search berkeley-db
==> Formulae
berkeley-db ✔                                                                      berkeley-db@4 ✔
```

[09-Jan-19 07:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
homebrew on os x makes it simple to try diff versions, but i seem to have 2 versions enabled at once

[09-Jan-19 07:35 PM] jorian#4555
great..

[09-Jan-19 07:36 PM] jorian#4555
i might try my mac then, was trying on ubuntu 18

[09-Jan-19 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
sure, it will give another data point 😃

[09-Jan-19 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
I promise, wack *does* work when all the stars align

[09-Jan-19 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
took me a long time to initially get it to work, because of these issues

[09-Jan-19 07:38 PM] jorian#4555
great 😄 i'll keep fighting

[09-Jan-19 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian is the wallet.dat corrupt perhaps, or do you know it to be valid?

[09-Jan-19 07:42 PM] jorian#4555
i tried valid wallets and probably corrupt wallets

[09-Jan-19 07:42 PM] jorian#4555
both get the same

[09-Jan-19 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, just found a thing

[09-Jan-19 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
`db_dump wallet.dat`

[09-Jan-19 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
will tell you some stats about it

[09-Jan-19 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
db_dump dn2id.dbb
VERSION=3
format=bytevalue
type=btree
db_pagesize=4096
HEADER=END
DATA=END
```

[09-Jan-19 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
verify that you see VERSION=10 with that util

[09-Jan-19 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
VERSION=10 is like, the future. Bitcoin forks use version 4, as far as I know

[09-Jan-19 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
same

[09-Jan-19 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
db_dump: BDB1009 wallet.dat: unsupported btree version: 10

[09-Jan-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
lulz

[09-Jan-19 07:44 PM] jorian#4555
db5.3-util was installed though

[09-Jan-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, berkeleyDB can't handle it's own older versions

[09-Jan-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
$ db_dump wallet.dat |head
VERSION=3
format=bytevalue
database=main
type=btree
db_pagesize=4096
```

[09-Jan-19 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
version 3 is ok, too. but not newer, it seems

[09-Jan-19 07:45 PM] $tefano.#3560
@Nabob sorry which node?

[09-Jan-19 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian oh, maybe I am understanding. You used a new bdb to MAKE that wallet. Now you need the new bdb to read it

[09-Jan-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
I didn't think about this, but the version of bdb you need corresponds to which version the wallet.dat was created with

[09-Jan-19 07:46 PM] jorian#4555
the wallet is as recent as yesterday

[09-Jan-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
you used a new bdb, so now you need a new one

[09-Jan-19 07:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
kmd pulls its own bdb on build.sh I think version 6 something

[09-Jan-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
my guess is you created the wallet with a new bdb

[09-Jan-19 07:46 PM] jorian#4555
yeah, that's what i thought too jok3r

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] jorian#4555
so i have to downgrade

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] jorian#4555
which is always a pita

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] jorian#4555
ugh. gonna try my mac first

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think you can

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure you want to downgrade

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] jorian#4555
it's on a node i'm planning on ditching anyways

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think maybe wack is finding your default bdb, but you have 2 installed, and wallet was created with newer bdb

[09-Jan-19 07:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
installing multipel bdb's, what fun it is

[09-Jan-19 07:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure where the build.sh "installs" it too...

[09-Jan-19 07:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thauight it built it into the daemon lol

[09-Jan-19 07:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats the version he will need to use

[09-Jan-19 07:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is your friend

$(package)_version=6.2.23

[09-Jan-19 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, it installs it into the tree, not system-wide iirc

[09-Jan-19 07:54 PM] jorian#4555
my mac can't connect to discord for some reason, but it has the same as you (brew formulae thing)

[09-Jan-19 07:54 PM] jorian#4555
with a check at @4

[09-Jan-19 07:55 PM] jorian#4555
same msg though.. btree 10

[09-Jan-19 09:21 PM] Emilis#3454
Anyone else having issues getting results with listunspent when specifying an address?

[09-Jan-19 10:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Emilis give exact errors and KMD version, and it will be easier to help you 😃

[09-Jan-19 10:01 PM] Emilis#3454
getinfo rpc calls shows version as 2001526
I'm getting just an empty array

[09-Jan-19 10:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
that means there are no utxos

[09-Jan-19 10:37 PM] Emilis#3454
I can see them on a block explorer though

[09-Jan-19 10:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
do you see it on your balance -> getinfo ?
