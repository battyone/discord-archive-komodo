A new de-anonymization/linkability attack has come to light for all $ZEC and $XMR coins, being developed by $HUSH community members.
We are building a competitor to @chainalysis for Zcash + Monero forks.

@Mylo does it mean you can throw REST calls to the komodod ?

[19-Sep-19 05:42 PM] xeonrider#3120
since you mentioned Axios

[19-Sep-19 05:45 PM] Mylo#8306
@xeonrider you need a CORS proxy in front of it.
https://github.com/imylomylo/cors-anywhere
git clone
npm install
PORT=12345 node server.js

then your axios requests will look like: `http://your.cors.proxy:port/127.0.0.1:7771`
e.g. 
```
    console.log("AppCoins Created");
    axios
      .get("http://" + process.env.VUE_APP_WEBHOST + ":" + process.env.VUE_APP_WEBPORT + "/" + process.env.VUE_APP_MMBOTHOST + ":" + process.env.VUE_APP_MMBOTPORT + "/api/v1/legacy/mm2/get_enabled_coins")
      .then(response => {
        console.log("MYLO" + JSON.stringify(response.data.result));
```

you gotta have some grey hairs in your beard maybe 😛

[19-Sep-19 05:48 PM] Mylo#8306
@xeonrider *warning* i am a "weekend coder" - and putting a CORS proxy in front of your blockchain daemon (btc, kmd, zec etc.) is a good way to have your base belong to someone else.

[19-Sep-19 05:49 PM] xeonrider#3120
@Mylo didn't anyone do this before

[19-Sep-19 05:51 PM] Mylo#8306
it's not a recommended best practise to expose your blockchain to a web app - more like a worst practise if you have anything of value on it.

[19-Sep-19 05:51 PM] xeonrider#3120
I mean, there aren't any dApps?

[19-Sep-19 05:52 PM] Mylo#8306

[19-Sep-19 05:52 PM] xeonrider#3120
not to be mean, but everything here seems to be in development

[19-Sep-19 05:53 PM] xeonrider#3120
wouldn't it be like the first thing that you can tie an app to a blockchain?

[19-Sep-19 05:53 PM] Mylo#8306
depends.   komodo was one of the first multi-chain ecosystems.  depends if you like your horse first or your cart 😄

the horse moves...

[19-Sep-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
just issue curl calls from any app, that connects to the blockchain

[19-Sep-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what the problem is

[19-Sep-19 05:55 PM] xeonrider#3120
@jl777c if that package uses axios, it means I can send requests (like curl) only from a WWW perspective

[19-Sep-19 05:55 PM] Mylo#8306
nodejs

[19-Sep-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the komodod accepts requests from a port

[19-Sep-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
just issue requests to the port

[19-Sep-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
any app can connect to the blockchain

[19-Sep-19 05:56 PM] xeonrider#3120
does it handle it with a format?

[19-Sep-19 05:56 PM] xeonrider#3120
(json/xml)

[19-Sep-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
did you read the docs at all??

[19-Sep-19 05:56 PM] xeonrider#3120

[19-Sep-19 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
your end-goal is just to send request to komodod and receive json output from it

[19-Sep-19 05:59 PM] TonyL#3577
with bitcoind-rpc it'll be something like:
// creating rpc proxy
var rpc = new RpcClient(config);
// issuing rpc calls to proxy to get daemon output
var getinfo_json_output = rpc.getinfo();

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] xeonrider#3120
@TonyL so Komodo uses bitcoin rpc?

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] xeonrider#3120
like a standard?

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
```
  var config = {
    protocol: 'http',
    user: 'user',
    pass: 'pass',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: '18332',
  };``` just set correct params here (7771 port and use user name password from .komodo.conf)

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
this bitcoin-rpc is nothing special - it's just auth standartized way

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
and then sending requests and fetching json output from daemon

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] xeonrider#3120
oh

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] xeonrider#3120
thats pretty neat

[19-Sep-19 06:01 PM] TonyL#3577
so it should work with komodod as well - just set port, username/password and issue rpc calls

[19-Sep-19 06:01 PM] xeonrider#3120
so, I don't need axios at all

[19-Sep-19 06:01 PM] TonyL#3577

[19-Sep-19 06:01 PM] xeonrider#3120
and the daemon returns a json, right?

[19-Sep-19 06:01 PM] TonyL#3577
not sure how it's on JS but on python I can use standart `requests` lib lets say and just execute get calls - one above is just faster

[19-Sep-19 06:02 PM] xeonrider#3120
so my app can consume that easily

[19-Sep-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
yes, daemon returns json

[19-Sep-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
in some calls it might be number or bool

[19-Sep-19 06:02 PM] xeonrider#3120
@TonyL have you worked with assets already?

wuaaa you made rogue?!?!

[19-Sep-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
it's super simple to use CC rpc calls

[19-Sep-19 06:03 PM] xeonrider#3120
awesome

[19-Sep-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
not rogue itself but terminal interface for it

[19-Sep-19 06:03 PM] xeonrider#3120
wowowowowowow

[19-Sep-19 06:04 PM] xeonrider#3120
ok, ok now we are getting somewhere

[19-Sep-19 06:04 PM] xeonrider#3120
so how would that go when I use antara composer

[19-Sep-19 06:04 PM] xeonrider#3120
doesn't that launch like a blockchain for you?

[19-Sep-19 06:05 PM] xeonrider#3120
will it still allow RPC calls?

[19-Sep-19 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
you can launch your own chain using komodod, no need for antara composer

[19-Sep-19 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
the composer is just an easy way to do it

[19-Sep-19 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
but if you know rogue, then you can do start a chain using CLI i guess 😄

[19-Sep-19 06:05 PM] xeonrider#3120
yeah but I am just learning this stuff

[19-Sep-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577

[19-Sep-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
in general it's super simple: just start daemon on one node, start daemon on second node with connection to first one - thats it. Composer is kinda corporate thing in my understanding, for your CCs research purposes you can setup chain on your own

[19-Sep-19 06:11 PM] xeonrider#3120
how about an explorer

[19-Sep-19 06:11 PM] xeonrider#3120
if you have your own coin, you need an explorer right?

[19-Sep-19 06:11 PM] xeonrider#3120
or an own wallet

[19-Sep-19 06:13 PM] TonyL#3577
you can check needed info/transacitons in CLI

[19-Sep-19 06:13 PM] jorian#4555
there's support for insight explorers out of the box, if you need a web interface

[19-Sep-19 06:13 PM] TonyL#3577

@jorian cool thanks

[19-Sep-19 06:18 PM] xeonrider#3120
@Mylo i've heard of docker, don't know what it does

[19-Sep-19 06:18 PM] xeonrider#3120
can't I just use a linode

[19-Sep-19 06:20 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah you can use any VPS.   if you already are familiar with docker, it's just another tool to expedite - but if you don't know docker, don't start now - too much new stuff and moving parts - best, not to try too many new things at once.

[19-Sep-19 06:24 PM] xeonrider#3120
ok, so how about a wallet

[19-Sep-19 06:24 PM] xeonrider#3120
so got an own coin, a blockchain and an explorer

[19-Sep-19 06:24 PM] xeonrider#3120
(in theory)

[19-Sep-19 06:26 PM] TonyL#3577
you can fork an existing one, or create your wallet or list  in some wallet - not sure if I got the question

[19-Sep-19 06:36 PM] xeonrider#3120
@TonyL which one could I fork (and adjust?)

[19-Sep-19 06:36 PM] xeonrider#3120
well, if you got your own coin, you should be able to store it somewhere, with an address right?

[19-Sep-19 06:37 PM] xeonrider#3120
or would any KMD wallet suffice (but than again, how to find the balance?)

[19-Sep-19 06:40 PM] jorian#4555
the command line is your access to your wallet

[19-Sep-19 06:40 PM] jorian#4555
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=COINNAME getinfo` would give you your balance

[19-Sep-19 06:41 PM] jorian#4555
but if you want a fancy graphical user interface, you need to get listed in VRSC Agama, Chameleon, Pungo, or any other wallet

[19-Sep-19 06:41 PM] jorian#4555
or clone their software and maintain a wallet yourself

[19-Sep-19 06:41 PM] xeonrider#3120
and making my own?

[19-Sep-19 06:41 PM] xeonrider#3120
like the bot here

[19-Sep-19 06:41 PM] jorian#4555
yes, you can do it, but i think people like it when everything is in 1 place
