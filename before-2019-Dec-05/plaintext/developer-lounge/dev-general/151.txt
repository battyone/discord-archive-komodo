voting suffers tragedy of the commons. it probably wouldn't be hard to control the majority of notaries within 2 rounds of voting.

[22-Mar-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
is uses a sortition method to select 13 of the 64 to sign any given round

[22-Mar-19 11:30 PM] zack#6467
it seems like if you control the majority of notaries, then you undo blocks?

[22-Mar-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
how?

[22-Mar-19 11:30 PM] zack#6467
or at least censor them?

[22-Mar-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[22-Mar-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries only propose a notarization

[22-Mar-19 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if and only if a node already has the identical data, does it have any effect

[22-Mar-19 11:31 PM] zack#6467
13 of the 64 sign ever block root, and include it in bitcoin, right?

[22-Mar-19 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
not every one, about every 10

[22-Mar-19 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it anchors to the notarized chain

[22-Mar-19 11:32 PM] zack#6467
if a node has identical data... what pool is thhis "node" from? is it one of the 64? what data is identical or not identical? what are we comparing the data against to see if it is identical?

[22-Mar-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
a node can go from a non-notarized chain to the notarized, but not the other way around

[22-Mar-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
blockhash of a height about 10 minutes ago

[22-Mar-19 11:32 PM] zack#6467
how does a node "go" form one chain to another?

[22-Mar-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
normal nakamoto consensus that is just slightly modified with the rule that one a height has a valid notarization, it wont be reorged

[22-Mar-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the data is the blockchain itself

[22-Mar-19 11:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
there were some articles published in regards to this, from the debate with the gentleman from twitter and the notary collusion scenario

[22-Mar-19 11:33 PM] zack#6467
so the notarizers are just a checkpointing system, and they write the root hash into bitcoin

[22-Mar-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries propose a notarization that 10 blocks ago the hash was H. all nodes see this and if indeed 10 blocks ago the hash was H, that becomes the new notarized height

[22-Mar-19 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
to bitcoin and also to KMD

[22-Mar-19 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and assetchains write to KMD and to themselves

[22-Mar-19 11:34 PM] zack#6467
they write their root hash onto themselves. wasn't it already there?

[22-Mar-19 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the BTC txid that has the notarization is added to the notarized data

[22-Mar-19 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and for assetchains the KMD txid

[22-Mar-19 11:35 PM] zack#6467
oh, that way you can look it up faster

[22-Mar-19 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Mar-19 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
http://notarystats.com/

[22-Mar-19 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
shows the current status of notarizations for 50 or so chains

[22-Mar-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and even if the hash was already locally here, it is needed onchain to know that it was properly notarized and convenient to lookup and prevent reorging past it

[22-Mar-19 11:37 PM] zack#6467
fully synced Amoveo is currently 1.2 gigabytes.

[22-Mar-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
100 or so notarizations per day dont increase chain size that much

[22-Mar-19 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the giant benefit is that even chains with very low hash rate can be relied on to not have their blocks rewritten (After it is notarized)

[22-Mar-19 11:38 PM] zack#6467
Can you compare Komodo to Cosmos? it seems like you are doing something somewhat similar, right?

[22-Mar-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt cosmos having a small number of block producers?

[22-Mar-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
even permissioned if i remember right

[22-Mar-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
we also add the cross chain merkle data onto the notarization data that enables the automated cross chain tx

[22-Mar-19 11:40 PM] zack#6467
their root chain, the one that cooresponds with komodo chain, is using some POS consensus

[22-Mar-19 11:40 PM] zack#6467
you write the merkel roots from one chain onto the other?

[22-Mar-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so that aspect is quite different than cosmos, but they have a multichain architecture

[22-Mar-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the assetchain notarization sends up merkle root of merkle roots

[22-Mar-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and komodod uses this information to create a MoMoM merkle root of merkle root of merkle roots and that is also added tothe notarization

[22-Mar-19 11:41 PM] zack#6467
How does Komodo compare with drivechain? Any idea why Paul Sztorc isn't using Komodo?

[22-Mar-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
paul probably has a bunch of preconceived ideas about komodo, dont know him personally so I am only guessing

[22-Mar-19 11:42 PM] zack#6467
Have you looked at drivechain though? it's an idea for bitcoin sidechains

[22-Mar-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
we are implementing a gateways based sidechains

[22-Mar-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
deposit crypto and instead of just getting a token you get the native coin

[22-Mar-19 11:44 PM] zack#6467
deposit what crypto where? isn't every token native to something?

[22-Mar-19 11:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt fully decentralized, but an automated multisig with the top notaries as signers is a pretty good distribution

[22-Mar-19 11:44 PM] zack#6467
what isn't decentralized?

[22-Mar-19 11:44 PM] zack#6467
what are you distributing?

[22-Mar-19 11:44 PM] jl777c#5810
deposit KMD to the deposit multisig address for the sidechain

[22-Mar-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
then automatically you can create coins on the destination chain

[22-Mar-19 11:45 PM] zack#6467
oh, komodo has some trick for moving KMD onto all the chains?

[22-Mar-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
only the withdraw requires the multisig signers to sign the multisig withraw

[22-Mar-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Mar-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but this method can move any bitcoin protocol coin

[22-Mar-19 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
sidechain by federated multisig, i think they call it

[22-Mar-19 11:46 PM] zack#6467
you mean withdrawing KMD from an altcoin back onto Komodo requires the signatures of all the notaries?

[22-Mar-19 11:46 PM] zack#6467
the 13 for that round?

[22-Mar-19 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
no, no

[22-Mar-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you are combining things

[22-Mar-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
this is technically unrelated to notarizations

[22-Mar-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
however we have community elected notaries

[22-Mar-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
which by definition have a bit of trust

[22-Mar-19 11:47 PM] zack#6467
the notaries are just for checkpointing. so what is the trick to move KMD between the chains?

[22-Mar-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and the top ones in an automated multisig is a very practical federation

[22-Mar-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC

[22-Mar-19 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
is for tokenizing

[22-Mar-19 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
using a very similar process, instead of issuing tokens on deposit, the native coins for the side chain is issue

[22-Mar-19 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses a variation of our burn/import protocol

[22-Mar-19 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
that one allows N different chains to form a fungible cluster

[22-Mar-19 11:49 PM] zack#6467
so, what if the notaries all go on strike at the same time?

[22-Mar-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so we have the ability to burn coins on one chain and import them on another, using the MoMoM

[22-Mar-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
then notarizations stop, but the blockchain will keep going

[22-Mar-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
multisig deposits would be stuck

[22-Mar-19 11:49 PM] zack#6467
so it will make the low-hashpower chains less secure, and nothing more

[22-Mar-19 11:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
jeez, seems like i just extended this by 6 more hours just because i mentioned dpow ü§¶

[22-Mar-19 11:50 PM] zack#6467
oh, and moving money between the chains freezes?

[22-Mar-19 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
low hashrate chains are less secure, yes

[22-Mar-19 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
we are making a backup method to importcoins

[22-Mar-19 11:50 PM] zack#6467
komodo also has POW for issuing more KMD?

[22-Mar-19 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but that will still require signatures from a few notaries

[22-Mar-19 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yes PoW for the main KMD chain

[22-Mar-19 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
assetchains can configure 0% to 100% PoS

[22-Mar-19 11:51 PM] zack#6467
what algorithm is the POW?

[22-Mar-19 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
equihash

[22-Mar-19 11:53 PM] zack#6467
if there was an oracle on one of the assetchains, and the assetchain's POW forked the chain in 2, such that each side had a different oracle result, then all the KMD on that assetchain would get duplicated.
I guess the notaries would choose which side of the chain wins?

[22-Mar-19 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the import process relies on several rounds of notarizations

[22-Mar-19 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it only issues new coins after things are already notarized and cant change

[22-Mar-19 11:54 PM] zack#6467
would the notaries choose which side of the chain wins?

[22-Mar-19 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand the scenario

[22-Mar-19 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
a height is either notarized or not

[22-Mar-19 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is, then it wont change

[22-Mar-19 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarized chain wins

[22-Mar-19 11:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`so, what if the notaries all go on strike at the same time?`
I have a very profitable day üèñ

[22-Mar-19 11:55 PM] zack#6467
if one of the asset chains has a fork in it's POW, so there are 2 versions of it being mined, would the notaries have any influence over which version of the chain wins?

[22-Mar-19 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if the assetchain  is forked it is likely that the notaries will have a hard time coming to consensus

[22-Mar-19 11:56 PM] jl777c#5810
we have seen during network events notarizations slowing down, this is an indication something is wrong

[22-Mar-19 11:56 PM] zack#6467
If I controlled more than half of the notaries, and I wanted one side of the chains fork to win, could I force it?
