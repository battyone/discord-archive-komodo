Gotta say, the possibilities of the asset chain parameters are pretty exciting!

Loving the idea of doing disposable, short-term blockchains for rapid projects, tied to a long-term ecosystem currency for payouts.

Are there any plans to split ``ac_perc`` so that you can have one percentage for blocks mined, and another for transactions?

Seems like it'd be useful...?

[29-Sep-18 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why?

[29-Sep-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is not always a block reward.

[29-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You might want to have a higher pubkey reward for miner activity, but a lower reward for end-user activity, so that business developers can separate out the different audiences in their financial structure.

For gateway deposit I have to call `z_sendmany` where as first parameter I have to input wallet address from which I'm sending funds. This method "not super clever" and if funds on other address I'm just receive `"message": "Could not find any non-coinbase UTXOs to spend."` in `z_getoperationstatus`.
For now I found only solution like a:
1) get all addresses list
`./komodo-cli getaddressesbyaccount ""`
2) check balance for each address and provide user table `address - balance` so he'll able to choose needed address which will be used in `z_sendmany`

Other idea to `getaccountaddress` send whole balance on it and then use this address in z_sendmany - but user will lose txfee on each call

Is there some native call to get list of addresses with balances to assist user with sending address choice - maybe I'm missing something?

[29-Sep-18 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh call `listaddressgroupings` looks like right what I need
Question ^^ isn't actual )

[29-Sep-18 04:03 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yep

[29-Sep-18 04:05 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
listaddressgroupings is primarily to show which addresses are linked together (the first layer of arrays are organized according to relationships)

But it does that the side use of determining which addresses have which amount.

The other method I can remember off the top of my head is to do `listaddresses`, and then do a `getbalance` of each address, which may not be bad in a script, but isn't as useful in the terminal.

[29-Sep-18 05:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Another question, in addition to the first:

could you set `ac_decay` above 100000000? That would make it so that the block reward increases over time. 

Not sure why you might want a coin that's scarce at first, and then becomes less valuable over time...

but I guess that's what governments do, with inflation. 

Maybe you'd want some inflation, so people are inclined not to hold the asset for too long, but instead keep it moving...

[29-Sep-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
ac_decay I think is capped at 25%

[29-Sep-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just look at the code for such basic questions

[29-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah AppArmor is like SELinux in redhat, needs reboot on redhat last time i used it (v6).

[29-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Mylo#8306
i suppose

[29-Sep-18 10:28 AM] Mylo#8306
well....i'm going to be testing centos for compatibility with komod on redhat once some other things are finished.   any ideas if SELinux / AppArmor run in a container?

[29-Sep-18 10:29 AM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus mentioned redhat a few weeks ago, presumably for the enterprise market.  SuSE also has strong enterprise subscription product.

[29-Sep-18 10:35 AM] Mylo#8306
i don't like deb/ubnt naming conventions of packages.  iputils-ping vs dnsutils vs net-tools for ping, nslookup/dig, netstat

[29-Sep-18 02:05 PM] Mylo#8306
How does one specifiy a `-datadir` for a new assetchain?   komodod is stuck on "waiting for datadir" even if i create one with the name for the new assetchain to work with.

[29-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Mylo#8306
e.g.
```
komodod -ac_name=MYLO555 -ac_supply=555555 -datadir=~/.komodo/NODE2 -addnode=172.18.0.2 -gen -genproclimit=1 &

@Mylo and don't use ~ because sometimes that causes problems

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
i ran into some bugs with datadir + conf in regtest mode, i had to specify both

regtest uses -conf and -datadir

[29-Sep-18 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
-datadir is added in a different file, those are "extra args" added to the default ones

[29-Sep-18 05:16 PM] Mylo#8306
ok cheers

[29-Sep-18 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think kmd gets confused when not given both datadir + conf

[29-Sep-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
because there is logic to auto-calculate some stuff from AC name

[29-Sep-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
such as, the AC "BOBSTUFF" will always have the same rpc port, it's calculated from the name

[29-Sep-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
this also applies to file+directory structures for AC's

[29-Sep-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if you don't specify everything, things get confused. This is my guess as to what is going on

[29-Sep-18 05:19 PM] Mylo#8306
ok.   i can sorta see how you come to that conclusion.   in the past when i've tested stuff i've had to be very specific to get what i expect, but othertimes i'm a little bit 'huh?' and just continued without being too bothered if i didn't get my way.

[29-Sep-18 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
i had to do some special magic to get asset chains working with the KMD test suite

[29-Sep-18 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
the Zcash test suite we inherited never had any idea of such a thing

[29-Sep-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure the datadir has correct permissions (not owned by root on accident/etc)

[29-Sep-18 05:22 PM] Mylo#8306
nice.  so general improvements all around.

[29-Sep-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
REGTEST always has the same rpc port, but Zcash test suite wants to give every regtest daemon a random port, so I had to route around that

[29-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah getting nice warnings `unexpected fname.(/home/user/.komodo/MYLO555_NODE2) vs MYLO555 [MYLO555] n.7 len.32 (5_NODE2)`

[29-Sep-18 05:27 PM] Mylo#8306
we haven't even scratched the surface with REGTEST and all the ac_params yet have we?

[29-Sep-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
that warning, oh that warning

[29-Sep-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
i tried to fix it, but at the time that code runs, the code doesn't even know if it's running in regtest mode or not

[29-Sep-18 05:30 PM] Mylo#8306
ok...so it doesn't know it's got a -datadir either than i guess.

[29-Sep-18 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think that warning is essentially wrong

[29-Sep-18 05:30 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah it's working...blocks are mining.

[29-Sep-18 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
that warning never expected a full file path, it only ever expected a relative dir name

[29-Sep-18 05:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i get that warning a bajillion times, one for every block mined. But everything works

[01-Oct-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not a bad idea, someone porposed something similar for the early days of the scaletest... as the mining power required was the limiting factor there, and someone suggessted to merge mine all the AC with a single miner. Cutting the required CPUs down by like 8000x

[01-Oct-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL

[01-Oct-18 03:44 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes, that way I can own most of the ac chains at once üòà

[01-Oct-18 03:46 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the down side of that idea, though, is that PIRATE likely wouldn't have near the hashrate it has

[01-Oct-18 03:57 AM] joey#9690
Similar to merge mining, except with merge mining, the hashrate isn't added together and the parent chain doesn't gain from exclusive hashrate on the childchain

[01-Oct-18 04:08 AM] joey#9690
How are AC chains secured?

[01-Oct-18 04:09 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
many use dPoW through the use of notary nodes

[01-Oct-18 04:09 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Some are secure by both massive hash and dPoW

[01-Oct-18 04:12 AM] joey#9690
Right, I remember reading about this now, thank you

[01-Oct-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes STAKED is extremly sercure like Verus, although not quite as good as VERUS.

[01-Oct-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or at least it will be when its launched for real.

[01-Oct-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we are using all PoW chains for current testing, just for ease of setup.

[01-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Mylo#8306
VRSC is the ticker if that's what you mean

[01-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Mylo#8306
more like a mining signalling protocol than merge mining.   how would parallel-pow deal with small chain re-orgs for the parallel consensus proof chain or would they be mining on delayed (already re-orgd) blocks?  would this dilute the value of some of the higher value chains because the high value motivates the miners to mine it?

[01-Oct-18 12:47 PM] joey#9690
@Mylo there's only one nonce, and one proof-of-work, so a re-org of PoW on one chain would re-org all chains. I think that's fine, set the block time high like with bitcoin and use FIBRE and you have close to zero reorgs ever (like bitcoin)
