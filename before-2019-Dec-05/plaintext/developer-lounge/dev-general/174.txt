Not sure where to ask, but I'll try here.  i'm setting up pos64staker, I'm not sure how to determine what's the optimal number to choose for RNDSendMany and for the variance.

there is quite a bit of strategy to it, but the easiest way to think about it is 

What is the smallest UTXO size that will stake in one month?

[19-May-19 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
takes a bit of stat gathering and intuition to figure out that number

[19-May-19 08:41 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks for the quick reply. Is there any documentation somewhere that I can read to educate myself on that? (assuming I can figure out the formulasüòÖ )

@Mylo @Alright @TonyL @dukeleto @grewalsatinder @artemciy_dice @dimxy @lukechilds @Deleted User  
can we have a doc similar to this: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/python-rpc-komodod.html
for all the backend programming languages, starting from C, C++ to javascript,  RUST, Go and java ?
the slickrpc module used in the python doc above is just a wrapper around a regular curl command : https://github.com/barjomet/slick-bitcoinrpc/blob/master/slickrpc/rpc.py
it was developed with bitcoin in mind, but it can be used with komodo too

I expect similar things are already available in all the above languages for bitcoin so we need people who know these languages to look for the specific packages/modules/code-snippets and write a simple readme with instructions on how to call an rpc and how to receive its output in the above languages

This will be a valuable addition to our docs and reduce some barrier to newer devs that are experimenting and are not comfortable with bash scripting or just copy pasting comands into the terminal

it depends on security point of view.   we haven't in the past because these wrapper libs are not tested by security team, and endorsing them for use on komodo has been against the security ethos.   this is why they are not hosted on any komodo repos etc.

we can discuss in team meeting this week.  plz bring it up if i forget üòÉ

last week i took my javascript-rpc for web browser, and removed the `axios` dependency so it uses the browser native `fetch` commands, so there is no dependency.   it still requires a proxy between daemon and browser, but it's only for providing browser examples...

[20-May-19 07:01 AM] gcharang#6833
My thought wasn't to provide a complete wrapper for every rpc, just document the way it can be done and let the developer deal with the outputs etc., 
this is just for them to experiment with the rpc and see the outputs and possibly automate 2 -3 steps. not to make a full fledged sdk
something like this:
```

console.log("Welcome to the heaps simple rpc tester!")
// stdrpc
const stdrpc = require('stdrpc')
// const rpc = stdrpc("http://localhost:11607/", { // PIZZA
const rpc = stdrpc("http://localhost:7771/", {
    req: {
        auth: {
            username: "rpcuser",
            password: "passworddrowssap"
        }
    }
});


process.exit(1)

// IN ORDER OF komodo-cli -regtest help

// == FSM ==
// FSMaddress [pubkey]
rpc.FSMaddress().then(resp => {
    console.log(resp)
}).catch(error => {
    console.log(error)
})
```
from your repo

[20-May-19 07:04 AM] gcharang#6833
or this:

```js
const stdrpc = require('stdrpc')

class KMDrpc {
    constructor(url, username, password) {
        this.url = url;
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
        this._rpc = this.connect(this.url, this.username, this.password)
    }

    connect(url, username, password) {
        console.log("Connecting to " + url )
        const rpc = stdrpc({
            url: url,
            username: username,
            password: password
        })
        return rpc ;
    }

    getinfo() {
        this._rpc.getinfo().then(resp => {
            console.log(resp)
        }).catch(error => {
            console.log(error)
        })
    }
```
should be enough for a js developer get started

yeah ok that makes sense i guess.

[20-May-19 12:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang i think it's a good idea to show how to talk to kmd from various languages

[20-May-19 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang this shows how to connect to hush/kmd and basically any cryptocoin via perl, maybe we can just link to this? https://github.com/leto/hushlist/blob/master/lib/Hush/RPC.pm

most btc rpc libs work just fine with KMD and AC's

[20-May-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang we could have a page with various languages, and then recommended libraries in that language

[20-May-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
For Perl, we recommend Bitcoin::RPC::Client

[20-May-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
etc for other languages

[20-May-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
I could make a Hush::RPC::Client and Komodo::RPC::Client to, if we really wanted, that just sets a default port/etc

[20-May-19 12:46 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, and direct devs to the readmes of these repos correct?

[20-May-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326

@webworker01 but listtransactions does show zxtns

[20-May-19 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 so my question is, why does it not show them in this case?

[20-May-19 03:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe it only shows *sent* xtns, and not received?

[20-May-19 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 does that seem intuitive or documented or sane to you?

[20-May-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
afaik, z stuff was meant to be distinct and that's why you use entirely different calls for TreasureChest than Agama and QT use and you get non 0.00000000 tx amounts

[20-May-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto no idea, can dig into it if it's important

[20-May-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
should it show them?

[20-May-19 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 well, it wasn't intuitive to me, a GUI wallet developer that would use the RPC

[20-May-19 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ i agree with you, and think there should be a z_listtransactions, but there isn't, ZEC mixed all that stuff into listtransactions

[20-May-19 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 I understand I can go "figure out the way to do what I need", but I am asking if the API is designed intuitively for people that should consume it, i.e. wallet developers, smart contract devs, etc...

[20-May-19 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
If stuff from upstream makes no sense, we should change it

[20-May-19 05:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright this is not critical, more of an "aesthetics of APIs". We have to constantly consume these APIs, and teach others to use them. I feel it's important to take pride in them and make them better versus the stance of "this is how it's always been done"

[20-May-19 05:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
the current design of the API makes GUI wallets for zaddrs inefficient

[20-May-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
what is it you need to do? Just a z_listtransactions kind of thing?

[20-May-19 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
in addition to it being un-intuitive and ugly to my eyes

[20-May-19 06:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i believe that myself and radix42 have wanted that in the past. Without it, you must iterate over every zaddr, and make an RPC call for all xtns of that zaddr via z_listreceivedbyaddress. If you have many zaddrs with no xtns, this is very wasteful. And GUI wallets perform this operation every 10 seconds

[20-May-19 06:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
it would benefit Pirate to have it as well, it would make GUI wallets take less resources

[20-May-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, lets make new rpc calls!

üôà 

[20-May-19 06:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
I will be making z_createrawtransaction, z_signrawtransaction and z_sendrawtransaction to support raw zaddr xtns and minimize any risk of introducing bugs into their non-zaddr cousins

[20-May-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
z_listtransactions is definitely an optimization for GUI wallets, which benefits Pirate/ac_private=1 chains the most

i've been adding all RPCs to my Rust pet project, making a rpc client. there is a lot of weird irregularities between rpc calls

[20-May-19 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
I would love to have it for Hush, could probably do it myself, but would gladly let somebody else

[20-May-19 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian are you talking about the lovely function signatures of different RPCs?

[20-May-19 06:07 PM] jorian#4555
```just don't break the old shit``` is probably why it is like this

[20-May-19 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
and the fact that escaping rules cross 2 languages

[20-May-19 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
you must appropriately escape JSON in your incoming language such that it is properly escaped when it hits the JSON RPC interface

[20-May-19 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
I can't describe how many subtle/crazy bugs are caused by that

[20-May-19 06:08 PM] jorian#4555
yes, among many other things, like using camelcasing in some calls, but snakecasing it in others

[20-May-19 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
try using a non-ascii character in the password of your rpc

[20-May-19 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
many libraries will fail to connect

[20-May-19 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
i could go on

[20-May-19 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@jorian part of the meaning of that is also that upstream and upstream of that too keep wanting to change and/or "depreciate" certain RPCs to the point of requiring rewrites on all kinds of software that depends on existing calls

[20-May-19 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian almost all CamelCasing comes from kmd world üòÖ

[20-May-19 06:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you look at latet btc core, they don't camelCase, and it's kind of hard to read some of the names, I don't know. Naming is hard

[20-May-19 06:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
camelCase tells you KMD wrote that RPC üòâ

@dukeleto the likability analysis thing needs an override I think

[20-May-19 06:45 PM] Alright#0419
so like in the event `"longestchain" : 0`, you can't use z_sendmany

[20-May-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
longestchain 0 happens all the time while testing, happens sometimes on production chains as well

[20-May-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
until the first block comes in, longest chain will be 0

[20-May-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
also if majority of peers dont agree, it wil be 0

[20-May-19 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
I've been doing a lot of testing with `-testnode=1` lately, longestchain is always 0 for this

[20-May-19 07:04 PM] Alright#0419
btw, don't think that's documented yet. `-testnode=1` allows you to run a network with a single node. Crazy convenient for testing

[20-May-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
well a single node has no peers

[20-May-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so how can there be a majority consensus among the peers that dont exist?

it is following the logic i wrote about above
