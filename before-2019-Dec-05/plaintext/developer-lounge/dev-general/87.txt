rescanning

[16-Dec-18 01:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
üòõ

[16-Dec-18 01:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ill wait for a day

[16-Dec-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah man ... its realy annoying .. I've spent a lot of time on it already without getting anywhere

[16-Dec-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
please @blackjok3r

[16-Dec-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
sort something Out üòÑ

[16-Dec-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
enough of these long rescans :?

[16-Dec-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ... I know exactly what its doing, but no idea why it does .. if there was onyl a way to have it just rescan the block the missing transaction was in ...

[16-Dec-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but where it checks this stuff, none of that data is avalible to do that

[16-Dec-18 01:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  how will i know that the nodes are fully synced

[16-Dec-18 01:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
because the daemon was stppped previously üò¶

[16-Dec-18 01:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and i didnt notice the height ?

[16-Dec-18 01:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
of the blocks

[16-Dec-18 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the secret to rescan is don't use it unless you know why you're using it
99.9999999% of the time rescan is manually used, it's used wrongly (or at a minimum, for the wrong reason)

[16-Dec-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie it forces it

[16-Dec-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to disable this rescan

[16-Dec-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to change code

[16-Dec-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then it gets very angry eventually

[16-Dec-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as the wallet DB gets very corrupted

[16-Dec-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just chec getinfo for longest chain @D.rabbani

[16-Dec-18 01:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have checked that

[16-Dec-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then its fine ... is it staking blocks ?

[16-Dec-18 01:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no i havent started staking

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yet

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
because i was waiting for staking node 2

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it finds blocks and all nodes accept them its fine

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and @blackjok3r  unfortunately my explorer is set up through docker

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the komodo version on that is 0.1.

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is the docker updated ?

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont know

[16-Dec-18 01:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh no üò¶

[16-Dec-18 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`as the wallet DB gets very corrupted`
That's when you need to use zap
with few exceptions, rescan should only be used to find a known missing tx
short of a block corruption, I don't recall the daemon ever "forcing" a wallet rescan :/

[16-Dec-18 01:37 PM] D.rabbani#9094
rebuild the image

[16-Dec-18 01:37 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its getting it from the repository right

[16-Dec-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It has txs in it that have no inputs ... for whatever reason and the deafult code is to trigger a rescanm it doesnt ask you about it... it just does it.

[16-Dec-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and its does not zap first

[16-Dec-18 01:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i didnt use zap wallet

[16-Dec-18 01:38 PM] D.rabbani#9094
cmmand

[16-Dec-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`It has txs in it that have no inputs`
that describes 99% of every UTXO I have in every wallet I have üòõ

[16-Dec-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats the error msg it throws .. but the actual prolem is that the part of the DB its trying to read is missing data ...

[16-Dec-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if there was only a way to just check GetTransaction for that tx and if it existed on chain addit to the wallet ... problem is solved... but as its in loading that data isnt there yet .

[16-Dec-18 01:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094
if the explorer is working fine  is there any problem if its not updated to komodo version latest

[16-Dec-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the node is sapling activated ... the old verison simply wont work.

[16-Dec-18 01:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@Deleted User  we are not using our own image

[16-Dec-18 01:40 PM] D.rabbani#9094

@blackjok3r i am still trying to get info

[16-Dec-18 01:49 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and the blocks are still increasing

[16-Dec-18 01:49 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it says notarized  block something on both staking nodes

[16-Dec-18 01:49 PM] D.rabbani#9094
once it fully syncs then i can start with

[16-Dec-18 01:49 PM] D.rabbani#9094
staking right

[16-Dec-18 01:50 PM] D.rabbani#9094
actually no idea what was the previous height of the block was when it stopped

[16-Dec-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the blocks that it already has from before update are invalid you would know about it

[16-Dec-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would be throwing errors all over the place

[16-Dec-18 01:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@Deleted User  the sapling _lite is not working :/

[16-Dec-18 01:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai do i start with staking ?

[16-Dec-18 01:52 PM] D.rabbani#9094
or shall i wait

[16-Dec-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if its synced you can start staking...

[16-Dec-18 01:52 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean the blocks are increasing

[16-Dec-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you can doit now im not too sure

[16-Dec-18 01:52 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh üò¶

[16-Dec-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
