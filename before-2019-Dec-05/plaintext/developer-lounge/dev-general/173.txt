ok checkout <https://cryptofi.co> ..i build this and it's support KMD ..check it out ..would love feedback

[15-May-19 03:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Nice site.  Good concept that can be built into many different tools/services.  Do you mind if I approach you about something @coinmonks || CoinCodeCap ?

[15-May-19 09:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
anyone here can explain in simplified terms how to figure out how many utxos to have in each segid for optimal staking?

Can someone, please, tell me what causes komodod to get here:
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/dev/src/miner.cpp#L806>

[16-May-19 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's a KMD wallet and it keeps freezing and all that's in debug is:
`2019-05-16 10:51:24 ERROR: ContextualCheckBlock: contains a non-final transaction`

[16-May-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
likely some transaction in the mempool turned out to be invalid in a block

[16-May-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
nLockTime set to more than median blocktime from last 17

[16-May-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Try to get the pool to update the block template more often maybe?

[16-May-19 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it runs every 55 secs and KMD is the only chain it happens on

[16-May-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes because of nLockTime being set and used on KMD I would say, as jl said.

[16-May-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think once nearly all ndoes get the 200 block tx expirt default rather than the ridiclous 20 it has been set at, these kind of theing will just go away

[16-May-19 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any idea what I can do to stop it from locking up?

[16-May-19 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no lol... I need a ndoe in the locked state to see what is holding the lock

[16-May-19 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then maybe we can fix it... deadlocks are extremly tricky to fix

[16-May-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait. I see the problem here

[16-May-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-May-19 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from dev on down, I've been trying to narrow this down for weeks now

[16-May-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll push a fixto my beta, any chance you can test that beforeI make  PR?

[16-May-19 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sure, KMD chain is locked so I have to reboot the pool itself anyway
the only problem is that it's entirely sporadic and may happen 5 times a day or once every 5 days

[16-May-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I see exactly what is causing it to lock, I thaught that IF was redundant and nothing could enter it 😆

[16-May-19 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo/commit/c2261146d94225aeda6ddede7496d208d5b5188a
This should do the trick. If the block fails now, it will just fail anmd create a new one, without locking up 😃

all these times and this was the 1st time getblocktemplate actually returned an error I could even start looking at

[16-May-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt build yet. wait a few minutes

[16-May-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fixed.

[16-May-19 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any chance this will also fix `"Cannot get a block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!"` return when it's both in sync and has peers? 😛

[16-May-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure that error is just wrong

[16-May-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never really worked out what triggers it myself. Pushed a couple of updates that should be safer... that IF is too confusing, so just sticking another if in there to be sure.

[16-May-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just ignore it because it never lasts for more than 1-4 seconds, I've assumed it's loop or work queue related

[16-May-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`if (Params().MiningRequiresPeers() && (IsNotInSync() || fvNodesEmpty))`
out of that, `IsNotInSync` is probably what causes it by a guess... if it decides its back in sync in a few seconds then I dont see a problem

[16-May-19 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, added and restarted the pool, will see what happens (hopefully nothing eventful)
tnks again

[16-May-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thank you! so much code has changed, hopefully we can catch and fix all these little edge cases before fork

[16-May-19 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_just wants to stop looking like shit because he, of all people, can't keep a pool running for a whole week_ :troll_hardcore:

```bash
# creates the tmux session called ssh_tmux if none exists or reattaches to a already existing session with that name.
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [ "$SSH_CONNECTION" != "" ]; then
    tmux attach-session -t ssh_tmux || tmux new-session -s ssh_tmux
fi
```
adding the above lines to your `.bashrc` file makes connections to your VPS always be a tmux session that survives between different sessions as long as the VPS is not rebooted

there is https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect to help with system restarts but I haven't tested it
blackjoker's recommendation: https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux  for a config thats looks very cool and just works

just wanted to share as these make working on a VPS so much better

are there instructions somewhere to setup an explorer for a single assetchain?

i.e., I created an asset chain using 2 VPS
the chain is running
want to explore the chain with a block explorer

I am aware of  the repo: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install
but it installs all the assetchains wholesale, I am looking for a solution that works for a single assetchain whose daemon is running

[17-May-19 06:56 AM] gcharang#6833
thanks  @CHMEX 

so, I need to replace this line:
```
declare -a kmd_coins=(CHAINNAME)
```
with say
```
declare -a kmd_coins=RFOX
```
for RFOX chain
run the script
run the `RFOX-explorer-start.sh` script that is generated
unblock port 3100
and going to http://VPS-IP-ADDRESS:3100 from my local computer should work?

[17-May-19 06:57 AM] CHMEX#0686

I'm trying again to get komodo to build in alpine.  While I deal with the glibc vs musl issues watching this build over I'm wondering what the actual build and run (I can probably figure out the runtime deps) dependencies are for komodod, what is listed on the github repo seems to include a lot of unnecessary crud and doesn't list some dependencies that are only included if you do not use --no-install-recommends.

so you guys require all 5 coins to have nodes running for a notary on KMD?

[19-May-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810

in order to run a KMD notary node, is it required to run all 5 of the listed coin nodes (compiled from source) ?
