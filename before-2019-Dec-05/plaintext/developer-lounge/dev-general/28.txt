Ok, it's late on Friday night here, going to take a break. Will catch up on whatever we find when I get back.

[22-Sep-18 05:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
that definitely seems like a bug

[22-Sep-18 05:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ya, it's the bug from earlier.

[22-Sep-18 05:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
i just crashed an AC by asking for `getchaintips`

[22-Sep-18 05:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
i tested on PIRATE

[22-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yep. I've tested on a bunch of different chains, include BOTS, CRYPTO, KMD, and a regtest, and then the ones that I did when I was going through the documentation.

[22-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did get it to work at some point.

I made a completely clean regtest chain, with no transaction history, and did the chain tips first things. -- at least, that's what I think I did. It's been a few days.

[22-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But I have results from that in my documentation, so at some point I must have been able to get it to work.

[22-Sep-18 05:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, calling it a night.

made it into an issue so it doesn't get lost

[22-Sep-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is crashing in the first iterator. but no idea why

[22-Sep-18 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it appears to iterate randome depths before crashing. seems a missing lock somewhere

[22-Sep-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
I added a mutex lock, but it still crashes. it is inside an iterator. I will leave this to someone else to fix

@saniales 

We have some preliminary documentation, as JL777 posted above.

We also have the docs.komodoplatform.com website, but it does not yet have anything regarding the crypto-conditions smart contracts update.

I'm working towards creating a more finished set of documentation for the entire ecosystem -- it's a new-ish endeavor. 

If you would like to provide me with questions and feedback, please do so. I'll be very interested to hear what can make the developer experience better for you.

Question.

When someone last worked on the documentation for asset chains, we listed Ubuntu 16.04 as the recommended version.

Should we update this at least to 17.10, or even 18.04?

Another question.

I finally got my computers talking to each other (thank you Nabob, Alright, and Hermes for the help) and mining on a test asset chain.

Both my machines are talking. I added them using the `addnode` command, and used just `onetry` as a parameter.

Curiously, I noticed when I do the RPC `getinfo`, I see three connections, rather than one.

So, I did a `getpeerinfo` rpc call, and I see that my connections have each added tripled with mysterious ports.

Is this normal?

For example, for one machine I'm using local ip address `192.168.1.110`, and the network also added `192.168.1.110:44060` and `192.168.1.110:43812`.

Can anyone help me understand what happened there? Those ports are neither my `rpcport` nor my `p2pport`. They just showed up.

[27-Sep-18 09:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, what's difference when executing something on a mac vs on ubuntu?

For instance, if I have this command from ubuntu, how would I change it so that it works in the mac shell?

```
komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=<IP address of the second node> &
```

[27-Sep-18 09:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
2 ports:
p2p port and rpc port

[27-Sep-18 09:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
could that be what you see?

[27-Sep-18 09:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay read again... not sure then....

[27-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Nabob#5004
both on linux and mac command is same to start daemon

[27-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Nabob Thanks.

@grewalsatinder 
Ya, it's not either of those. I have no idea where they came from. Really weird.

[27-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
When I saw three connections pop up in `getinfo`, I wondered who could have joined my network.

[27-Sep-18 10:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c can clear I think

[27-Sep-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
you did addnode, which probably added a node

[27-Sep-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in addition to the normal adding nodes process

[27-Sep-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not predictable what peers you end up with

[27-Sep-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you really constrain it with -connect

[27-Sep-18 10:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm, okay.

so, the ip address I used was the same for both `addnode` and the one I wound up with, but the ports were unpreditable. Good to know. Don't think I need to dive too much deeper into it, sounds like it's just a quirk that one can get used to.

[27-Sep-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it lists the connections that are outbound as diffrent ports from that node's ipaddress

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Sep-18 12:54 PM] Mylo#8306
If you do a `netstat -ptan` you get network info.   Outbound connections generally are randomly selected ports. It‚Äôs cheaper to hand off to OS and most stuff is written cheaply because there‚Äôs a reasonable level of sensible conventions.  As a programmer you don‚Äôt know what other programs/environments your code runs ...

[27-Sep-18 12:56 PM] Mylo#8306
Good to know difference between addnode and connect.  Handy when troubleshooting to specific hosts

[27-Sep-18 12:56 PM] Mylo#8306
Or network our grades I suppose and you want consensus

[27-Sep-18 11:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Question:

To change any of the asset chain paramteres and customizations after a coin is launched, a hard fork is always necessary, correct?

[27-Sep-18 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
Yes, but you can set a height activation for it

[27-Sep-18 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
so you can say "update by this block height"

[27-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Alright#0419
you'd either need a source code fork or to get a PR accepted to komodo

[27-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
When you say "source code fork" or "PR accepted", it sounds like you're referring to changing the underlying code of the parameters -- is that what you mean?

Just to be clear, I'm wondering about changing a built-in setting, like the block reward or something, while still staying within the KMD default options.

[27-Sep-18 11:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, do we have any documentation on how to do a hard fork with an asset chain? Seems like I should write that, if we don't.

[27-Sep-18 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
currently, you'd have to change the underlying code

[27-Sep-18 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
so you'd need nodes to update to that code

[27-Sep-18 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
if there were a chain that wanted it, I imagine it'd be possible to add something similar to ac_ccactivate for all the paramters

[27-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm... I have many questions. Hope you don't mind if I'm a bit persistent here in asking questions, just to make sure I understand and communicate it clearly in the documentation.

Based off what you're saying, it sounds like after you create an asset chain, the *only* way to change it is to change the underlying code. 

It sounds like you would need someone who can engineer a blockchain?

[27-Sep-18 11:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no.. not exactly.

[27-Sep-18 11:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its just a aheight activation

[27-Sep-18 11:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would be as simple as looking in the code for anohter height activation, copying hte code and changing it to your chain.

[27-Sep-18 11:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but then you need to ge that change merged into komodo, or use your own verison of komodod from then on in, like we do with STAKED.

[27-Sep-18 11:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can you give me an example of how I might change the block reward from 10 to 100 or something?

[28-Sep-18 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can have a quick look

[28-Sep-18 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not 100% sure there is any height activations for AC already in the code

[28-Sep-18 12:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as always it takes james to do something once. before you can copy it

[28-Sep-18 12:10 AM] xRobeSx#5136

[28-Sep-18 12:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Sep-18 12:10 AM] xRobeSx#5136
i think v2 or v3 ha

[28-Sep-18 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no mean which AC?

[28-Sep-18 12:11 AM] xRobeSx#5136

[28-Sep-18 12:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ok will have a look thanks man, i fogot all about that shitcoin

[28-Sep-18 12:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thanks, @blackjok3r 

Another question in the meantime:

I understand that when you launch a KMD asset chain for the first time (ever, on any machine), you should include all the parameters that you want in the chain.

However, what about later users who join the network? Do you need to include the entire collection of paramters each time you launch a coin to join a network, or if you just use the right ac_name, ac_supply, and a valid node will the KMD daemon figure out all the rest of the details?

[28-Sep-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they need to be exactly the same very time
