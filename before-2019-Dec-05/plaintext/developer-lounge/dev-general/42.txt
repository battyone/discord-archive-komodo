ok, then no hacker will ever be able to get 61 confirms ahead

[21-Oct-18 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
never

[21-Oct-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
absolutely impossible

[21-Oct-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
unless nicehash is used

[21-Oct-18 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
their understanding of btc protocol is deep

[21-Oct-18 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
like the ocean

[21-Oct-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the rule of 60

[21-Oct-18 01:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c their code will prevent the "self-healing" that we saw in the emc2 attack, where old nodes jumped back to the correct dpow chain, because the re-org would be too large. Their code makes it so the attacker can split the network and then it requires a massive amount of manual work to reconcile forks. Sounds like one of the worst kinds of cryptocoin DoS's

[21-Oct-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
at least they save the 300 KMD per year

@jl777c Only 10k BTC trading volume today, hopefully they can find that 300KMD somewhere under their couch cushions

[22-Oct-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
They weren't very receptive to dpow. They ranted about centralization when I mentioned dpow in their discord

[22-Oct-18 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
wasn't a very friendly community

[22-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's see how decentralized they are when someone points some hash their way

[22-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, as with all things, true quality will always shine in the end

[22-Oct-18 03:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if they want dPoW they will know where to find kmd

[22-Oct-18 03:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
maybe they will try Veriblock once it's live

[22-Oct-18 03:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
still better than doing nothing

[23-Oct-18 01:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
60 block reorg is enough protection for them, all good.

[23-Oct-18 01:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Doesnt matter that the chain after a while cannot fix itself, but who cares about that when your chain has no utility anyway

[23-Oct-18 01:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Plus most would be on Binance anyway, all good ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Oct-18 03:43 AM] mrdotboson#5783
Hey. Iâ€™m from MintFlint.

[23-Oct-18 04:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@mrdotboson Welcome, it is I, your mate from twitter lol.

[23-Oct-18 04:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just a bit of background for everyone, @mrdotboson is thinking of using KMD instead of a ERC20 token but their dev has some questions. @SHossain who did the IOS app? Was it @pbca26 ?

[23-Oct-18 05:24 AM] gcharang#6833
Yes it was pbca who made the ios version of Agama too.

[23-Oct-18 05:38 AM] mrdotboson#5783
Hey pondsea, thanks for inviting me here! Cool to connect with so much talent in one channel. Yes, weâ€™re considering replacing our ERC20 and were wondering how exactly we would make the payment gateway work if we used Komodo instead of Ethereum. At the moment, weâ€™re just considering and making sure we know all the facts so we can make a more informed decision. 

Essentially, what weâ€™re doing is creating a payment gateway for our coin on our IOS app. A user inputs their address (x) and the number of tokens they are transferring (y) before making a transfer. App then checks if a payment has been received in our wallet (z) by x address with y tokens. If yes, payment is considered successful. 

There is no wallet built into the app. I am not entirely sure how weâ€™re doing this with Ethereum, Maxim would be in a better position to answer that, but I believe weâ€™re using EtherScan APIs. Our question would be if we were using Komodo, what exactly would the process involve and how exactly can we make this work

[23-Oct-18 08:53 AM] IamLegion#7781
@mrdotboson from the sound of it you're using a web-based API to interact with chain information. Any coin could do that as long as it had a stable web-based API at an address you could access

[23-Oct-18 08:57 AM] IamLegion#7781
Through an API your token information could be recorded in transactions on the KMD blockchain the same way that Komodo uses Bitcoin to secure it

[23-Oct-18 08:58 AM] IamLegion#7781
With the right form of encoding and decoding transaction information is surprisingly versatile

[23-Oct-18 10:15 AM] Mylo#8306
doesn't sound difficult if no wallet in the app, just an RPC call or web api to interact with.   Probably already using a 3rd party like coinpayments or netcoins or something.

[23-Oct-18 10:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
@Mylo  are you aware of any other crypto-related projects seeking a similar deal with AWS?

[23-Oct-18 10:39 AM] Mylo#8306
all of them - if your definition of "seeking" is broad.   otherwise, i haven't a clue sorry ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Oct-18 10:43 AM] Mylo#8306
AWS offers many levels of partnership.  the one that got announced by some other project last week and published on coindesk was not a "world first".  not to water down their achievement - congratulations.   but komodo already has engagement with AWS and funding provided for specific testing on their platform.  most of the bigger news sites run on a pay-to-play basis to get content published, so it's quite likely it was a paid for article to appease investors

[23-Oct-18 10:43 AM] Mylo#8306
QTUM.   good project btw.  innovative.

[23-Oct-18 10:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
The purpose is to increase transaction bandwidth specifically, or is it there a more nuanced goal for kmd/aws working out a relationship?

[23-Oct-18 10:44 AM] Mylo#8306
eth has a bunch of service providers on there doing eth related cloud stuff.

[23-Oct-18 10:45 AM] Mylo#8306
@actionslacks check #dev-scalability channel, there's a recent comment

[23-Oct-18 10:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
ok, thanks for all your hard work at this @Mylo !

[23-Oct-18 10:50 AM] Mylo#8306
oh someone missing from that, actually @patchkez got us over the line because i had trouble configuring some hard cloud policy thing.  so yeah, him as well!

[24-Oct-18 02:55 AM] Alright#0419
Can anyone think of of way to grab the `-pubkey` set by a daemon with Python?

[24-Oct-18 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
are there any rpcs calls that output it?

[24-Oct-18 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
Ok, found a way to do it, just very very annoying

[24-Oct-18 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
`getblocktemplate` outputs this 
`"coinbasetxn": {
    "data": "01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0503c4910000ffffffff01902f9b3b000000002321022d13cc239ebbd2dc2dc7c69412c8833413aeec86a676d716866a3e3b021243d4ac58e0cf5b"`
Which I can use `decoderawtransaction` on and look at scriptPubKey

[24-Oct-18 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
any easier way of doing it?

[24-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  pushed to blackjok3r branch on staked a hack to show pubkey if its set in getinfo

[24-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it works

[24-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
was very easy, I suggest this be pushed to komodo repo aswell. It will make dAPPs much easier

[24-Oct-18 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
ty

[24-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will atempt to add RPC to set pubkey if its not set .. not sure if that can be done but will try it ...

[24-Oct-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as it cannot be changed once set, it should be ok.

[24-Oct-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This allows dAPP to start daemon, generate address then set pubey withoug restart, seems extremly useful.

```

[24-Oct-18 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There we go... this looks pretty perfect... You can now set the pubkey with an RPC, it wont allow setting an invlaid pubkey and will also tell you if the address is imported.

[24-Oct-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This should allow dAPPs to be made about 1000x easier I will submit PR to FSM with this change, as its very much needed to make develpoment and UX better/easier.

its a little bit more complicated that I thaught it would be, but its not that bad.

[24-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it works... you can only set it once.

[24-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@D.rabbani  your question is unclear what are you trying to do?

[24-Oct-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically an invlid pubkey converts the burn address, so I checked igf pubkey -> R address does not equal burn address, then copy pasted the code from vallidate address to validate the R address and detemine is mine.

[24-Oct-18 08:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  I just need to know the mechanism behind the 12 or 24 word phrases that where do we store it just as in.agama wallet is there any particular database ?? Where we store those 12 words pharases I am.trying to study same thing as a developer can.you help.me out
