@MyName  that doesn't work. the central host can publicly say one thing, and sign something different, to make tons of money in the betting markets.

[22-Mar-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but for things that few people (or only one ) cares about I dont see how it could assure any trustless reliability of data

[22-Mar-19 05:59 PM] zack#6467
why would it needs funds at stake?

[22-Mar-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
since there wont be much if any money at stake

[22-Mar-19 05:59 PM] zack#6467
if there is nothing at stake, then the result of the oracle doesn't matter

[22-Mar-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
????

[22-Mar-19 05:59 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you;d almost be better off having oracle data imput protected by large multisig to get at least a form of primary consesnsus

[22-Mar-19 06:00 PM] MyName#0491
@zack If it "works" or not, it's your reference point as to what a "typical oracle mechanism" is.
You can't have it both ways.

[22-Mar-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
wait so you are saying that the quality of data doesnt matter at all

[22-Mar-19 06:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but this is just one context of oracle usage

[22-Mar-19 06:00 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
popular lies pay

[22-Mar-19 06:00 PM] zack#6467
multisig isn't secure as an oracle. it is a kind of voting and suffers from tragedy of the commons. in particular, see the p+epsilon attack paper from vitalik.

[22-Mar-19 06:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he says that the Amoveo oracles can only work on a betting context

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wait, so how are you validating oracles without some form of vote/consensus?

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] zack#6467
if no one is betting, then it doesn't matter what the outcome of the oracle is. no one loses anything

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but the data could be all wrong

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, that settles the issue then

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is trustless but totally wrong?

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] zack#6467
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator what does "validate an oracle" mean?

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Amoveo is just for betting, not for anything else

[22-Mar-19 06:01 PM] zack#6467
correct. it is a platform for financial derivatives

[22-Mar-19 06:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oracles CC is for many different uses of data streams

[22-Mar-19 06:02 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and if people are betting, the choice with the highest volume of stake wins?

[22-Mar-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is hardfork updated

[22-Mar-19 06:02 PM] MyName#0491
I'm still lost as to how I can pay to have data manipulated manually, but it's still trustless üòñ

[22-Mar-19 06:02 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`validate:` To declare or make legally valid.

[22-Mar-19 06:02 PM] zack#6467
not necessarily.   the winning outcome tends to have more stake, but having more stake doesn't necessarily mean it will win.

[22-Mar-19 06:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this seems a good conversation to get bet CC

[22-Mar-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i think he meant highest amount of bets

[22-Mar-19 06:03 PM] zack#6467
no one can manipulate the outcome by paying. not even if you had 51% of the veo

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] MyName#0491
`no one can manipulate the outcome by paying. not even if you had 51% of the veo`
Earlier you said that I could pay you enough to determine the other data was a lie and you'd manually "hard update"

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so how does the lesser stake side win?

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] zack#6467
it is not a popularity contest.
The oracle outcome that is more accurate will be more valuable, because people would prefer to own tokens on a blockchain with an accurate oracle.

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think people would just like to have more money

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of the factual accuracy

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] zack#6467
you would rather have more money in a valuable form of currency, yes

[22-Mar-19 06:04 PM] zack#6467
zimbabwe dollars aren't so great

[22-Mar-19 06:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if its a betting context, people just want to win bets

[22-Mar-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the absolute truth is secondary if it means you can win more money and be less accurate

[22-Mar-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810

Having a vested interest in the outcome of a prediction market doesn't make the prediction market less accurate.

[22-Mar-19 06:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```you would rather have more money in a valuable form of currency, yes
zimbabwe dollars aren't so great```
so the only argument now is that you chain is more valuable than komodo?

[22-Mar-19 06:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are odds variable based on spread ratio?

[22-Mar-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is the esthetic appeal . of being more accurate that makes it more valuable?

[22-Mar-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
when there wasnt money at stake, you said the accuracy didnt matter

[22-Mar-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so accuracy doesnt seem to have much value

[22-Mar-19 06:06 PM] zack#6467
@siu - Chainmakers  we are dicussing the coins on either side if the Amoveo oracle caused Amoveo to fork.

[22-Mar-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and if it chooses wrong, you will hardfork to correct it

[22-Mar-19 06:07 PM] MyName#0491
`so the only argument now is that you chain is more valuable than komodo?`
That was the conclusion I came to earlier, it's a matter of vested interest in market-share

[22-Mar-19 06:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why your coin has such a low supply?

[22-Mar-19 06:07 PM] zack#6467
its not the factual accuracy, it is the fact that it correctly judges over peoples money when they actually put money at stake

[22-Mar-19 06:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
isnt 60k coins too little in the long term?

[22-Mar-19 06:07 PM] zack#6467
no one cares what the outcome is if no one's money is at stake.

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
in your use cases that could well be

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
however there are many cases where accuracy of data matters

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
cumulative accuracy

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
consistent accuracy

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
data providers that can consistently provide accurate data, get subscribers

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] Alright#0419
side note, do you realize you don't have a license on any of this code?

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] MyName#0491
` it is the fact that it correctly judges over peoples money`
"correctly" as determined by what/whom? the miner that gets paid more by one "side" or the other?

[22-Mar-19 06:08 PM] zack#6467
As long as it is accurate when someone's money is at risk, that is what matters

[22-Mar-19 06:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
"The people who bet in an oracle would notice that it is going to lie, and alert me" this scenario does not have a decentralized solution.

[22-Mar-19 06:09 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how does the lesser stake side win?
are odds variable based on spread ratio?
what profit benefit does the oracle derive, and how is it punished for misbehaving?

[22-Mar-19 06:10 PM] zack#6467
@actionslacks  hopefully someone else starts developing for Amoveo eventually. I think if I died, someone would step up to the plate, there would be too much money to lose otherwise.

[22-Mar-19 06:10 PM] zack#6467

what exactly are you calling "too much money to lose"

[22-Mar-19 06:12 PM] zack#6467
I have an idea of how many veo they own, and how much effort it would take them to do the minimal housekeeping to keep amoveo running and survive a one in a blue moon attack.

[22-Mar-19 06:12 PM] MyName#0491
`someone would step up to the plate`
If your system was truly trusless, then there'd be no plate to step to
At some point, you have to take a self-assessment and realize that every claim you initially laid on Komodo also applies to Amoveo (equally)

"run over by a bus" attack üòÑ

[22-Mar-19 06:12 PM] zack#6467
over 100 people have forked amoveo github. so there are over a hundred plates already. that is pretty decentralized

[22-Mar-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
with oracles CC, we can rely on the subscribers to vote with their datafees to keep the oracles going

[22-Mar-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
on all the various chains where there are in use and will be used

[22-Mar-19 06:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just to be safe, I wouldnt go around putting a bounty on my own head like that either.

[22-Mar-19 06:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```over 100 people have forked amoveo github. so there are over a hundred plates already. that is pretty decentralized``` wait what??? that is a new argument

[22-Mar-19 06:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so you measure decentralization on the number of github forks? lol

[22-Mar-19 06:14 PM] MyName#0491
git forks do not = "decentralized"
22,306 bitcoin/bitcoin forks and 5 guys still control what bitcoin is/isn't

[22-Mar-19 06:14 PM] zack#6467
https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo 119 forks.
Any one of these could become the Amoveo core repository if I died

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 
the lesser side can win if there is a hard update to prevent the oracle from closing on the lying state.
the price of oracle bets is always 1:1
The oracle isn't a person. it is a datastructure. It doesn't own money or have a concept of "profit".

[22-Mar-19 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
a "hard update" is centralized

Because you're not one of the 5 Core devs with commit access
