Hello! I was wondering if it's possible to have a PoS chain that can create lots of NFTs for an auction house type of thing :)

[25-Aug-19 04:14 PM] JohnnyC#2488
I'm imagining this in a game-setting where people can find, maybe create, and sell NFTs

[25-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
it's possible to create a PoS chain that supports NFTs

[25-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
actually fairly easy to create, but you won't get far with the NFTs without decent devs at the moment

[25-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
still a WIP, basis is solid, just not that user friendly

[25-Aug-19 04:35 PM] JohnnyC#2488
Alright, that makes sense

I am contemplating converting a WebSocket proxy server written in Java to Perl, so I can actually maintain and fix bugs in it.

Can't decide if the pain of maintaining Java code and being SRE for it will be less or more than converting this code to another language.

@TonyL looks like a corrupt wallet.dat perhaps

[29-Aug-19 11:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL or maybe even a wallet.dat was deleted while the node was running?

[29-Aug-19 11:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a loooow level error. Never seen it, but I am familiar with `AsyncRPCOperation_sendmany::`

not being able to read that from the wallet is catastrophic

wallet.dat should be fine and not deleted (just created and funded it and can see the balance/utxos from my application), quite strange

Should be "use a different RPC" error

[29-Aug-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is maybe some shitty logic, too

[29-Aug-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
"if not sprout THEN sapling"

[29-Aug-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
so it thinks you are  sapling

[29-Aug-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
It thinks your t=>t is a sapling zxtn, and shits the bed

[29-Aug-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
Just use `sendtoaddress` and be happy

[29-Aug-19 12:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL as a guess, in the sprout days, this error was different

[29-Aug-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL I would argue that what you just saw is a real "bug", in that the error is so bad as to be useless. There should be error checking WAY above that code, that bails with a nice error message "z_sendmany is only for transactions that contain shielded addresses"

[29-Aug-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
bonus points if you send a PR üòâ

[29-Aug-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a simple way to count how many sprout/sapling joinsplits are in an xtn, if there are none => give that error

[29-Aug-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
` if (tx.vShieldedSpend.empty() && tx.vShieldedOutput.empty() && tx.vjoinsplit.empty())`

[29-Aug-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL untested, but that is what you need

[29-Aug-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
if that is true => throw nice error

[29-Aug-19 12:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
first 2 are for sapling, last one is sprout, so the code supports chains with sprout joinsplits

[29-Aug-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User all taddrs or some zaddrs?

[29-Aug-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
things might be happening too fast, and when adding in small clock deviations from different nodes, some transactions will not be "finalized"

[29-Aug-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's an internal state

[29-Aug-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
no RPC's expose this data

[29-Aug-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
`sleep` a bit before important things, perhaps. Or try to bisect this behavior to a certain commit that changes it

[29-Aug-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User this is on KMD master branch or what?

[29-Aug-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User non-finalized xtns are not accounted for correctly in RPC `balance` outputs

[29-Aug-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
this error will also depend on the state of UTXOs in the wallet

[29-Aug-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are getting unlucky and spending a non-finalized UTXO, is my hunch
