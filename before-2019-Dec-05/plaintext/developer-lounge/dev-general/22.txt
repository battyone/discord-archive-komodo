I'm around @Bryan_Beus audio might be sketchy.
The examples and stuff you're working on, if you're making "better" docs that should be the `komodo-cli help` outputs for various api calls, they need to be edit in source.

Once in source code, anyone can access the same docs - but more importantly, to create docs from all the `komodo-cli  help getblocksubsidy` without having two places to maintain them and adding administrative overhead, we can automate/script it to create docs - e.g. https://github.com/imylomylo/mkdocs.sh

if you copy _ONLY_ 1.sh into your machine with `komodo-cli` available in your `$PATH`, e.g. `sudo ln -sf /location/of/komodo-cli /usr/local/bin/` and then run `./1.sh` it will create the whole directory structure seen in that repo and create markdown versions of `komodo-cli help`.

What we need to do is track the changes you are requesting to be made in src code to be applied to tidy up the help output from daemon.

@Alright üëÜ  this is the goal, to fix src code help output.

[13-Sep-18 08:07 AM] Mylo#8306
be able to run a shell script to rebuild some markdown output.

[13-Sep-18 08:16 AM] Mylo#8306
We'll take your changes and apply them into src code for `help` output.   All good.  With markdown, we can convert them to RST format, and include them wherever the documentation requires them.

Re: incorrect links
Hi, 
fyi
Found incorrect links here: ```https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation/blob/master/docs/source/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.rst```
This link```:ref:`Installing Komodo Manually``` and ```:ref:`Asset Chain Parameters``` send me to the same page they're on, not info on ` Installing Komodo Manually` or `Asset Chain Parameters`
Thanks for your part in all the work on the docs!

[13-Sep-18 10:59 AM] CrisF#3405
The links her do the same ```https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation/blob/master/docs/source/komodo/assetchain-params.rst#id1``` so maybe this is on purpose.

Can you do them with Cc?

[13-Sep-18 02:56 PM] TonyL#3577
@PTYX I think just some custom CC needed to build a DEX bookmaker. Looks like a very interesting case for CCs application.
Bookmaker side with events/odds creation, events finishing
Player side with bets placing
Similar payouts mechanics to dice CC.

[13-Sep-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there will be betting CC

[13-Sep-18 02:57 PM] PTYX#6840
Agreed

[13-Sep-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles can provide the external data

[13-Sep-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
just have to get it so we can bet with real coins to make it more interesting

[13-Sep-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why the gateways CC first

[13-Sep-18 02:58 PM] PTYX#6840
We can already make a shapeshift based on cc for Komodo assets right?

[13-Sep-18 02:58 PM] TonyL#3577
If help will needed I can consult on this matter since I've worked in bookmaker for a few years as a math models based promotions/betting lines creator

[13-Sep-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810

[13-Sep-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but it only allows to trade against the onchain coin

[13-Sep-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but each chain can have a gateway for whatever coins

[13-Sep-18 03:02 PM] PTYX#6840
It's still interesting because it could be a better swapping experience for the users.

[13-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
token DEX are always much faster,just has the problem . of having to trust the gateways and the issue of the extra assets

[13-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC solves that so I think it immediately would make KMD the leader in token DEX

[13-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
techwise

[13-Sep-18 03:04 PM] TonyL#3577
First DEX bookmaker with atomic swaps where anyone can create custom bets - it's may be a huuge marketchanging project.  Like Augur but better.

[13-Sep-18 03:05 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a bookmakers whom accept bets in BTC but they are centralised. You have to rely that they are really will payout you in result + delays

[13-Sep-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
with oraclesCC the data sources can establish their reputations independently of the bookmakers

[13-Sep-18 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
then like the gateways CC, when you create a bet, you reference a specific oracletxid

[13-Sep-18 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
It's the future of betting industry, omg

[13-Sep-18 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe even specific pubkeys of data providers

[13-Sep-18 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
oraclefeed shows how to get the data onchain, and already there is a micropayment built in

[13-Sep-18 03:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Transparent, private, fast payouts, very competitive in spot of margin since open to anyone

[13-Sep-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so a data provider can monetize the data

but it does take time and money. i'm more interested in a CC based DEX

[13-Sep-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
for that token<->token swap is needed and I want one of the new CC devs to do that one

[13-Sep-18 03:26 PM] PTYX#6840

I'm going over the `ping` method, and can use some help learning where it is used, or how to see the results.

From what I can tell, `ping` is used inside of another method, `getpeerinfo`. You can see `pingtime: XXXXX` as a property in the returned result of `getpeerinfo`.

However, the documentation (possibly written long ago by someone not on our team?) indicates that there's also supposed to be `pingwait`.

I don't see `pingwait` in the returned results from `getpeerinfo`, and I'm wondering also if the `ping` method is used as a standalone method, when it provides no results.

[13-Sep-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
never used ping inside komodod

[13-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

I tried with the JSON validator.

[14-Sep-18 01:27 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And another question:

On the ``estimatepriority`` method, I'm getting the `-1` response, which would mean that my coin daemon hasn't observed enough blocks and transactions to make an estimate of a transaction's priority.

How can I get my daemon to make the necessary observations?

[14-Sep-18 01:27 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442

$ ./komodo-cli estimatepriority 6

-1
