I’ll add txindex to btc/bch config soon.

[08-Jul-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is working dont fix it!

[08-Jul-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
just trying to troubleshoot the bobs

[08-Jul-18 08:29 PM] tolken#2655
Ok, noted for future though.

[08-Jul-18 08:39 PM] tolken#2655
gunna see if I can get this ltc/kmd Alice buy to go through by disabling ltc native and usijg electrum.

[09-Jul-18 02:30 AM] tolken#2655
Getting utxo complains (address_myutxopair couldn’t find btc (addr) targets amoint amount ) when I try a kmd/btc Alice buy too. So not limited to ltc. It’s like it’s getting them swapped backward.

[09-Jul-18 02:55 AM] tolken#2655
ugg ok so tried Alice assetchains (oot/kmd) and no go either so something it’s up.

[09-Jul-18 12:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but with txindex=1 i cant use pruned modes for btc and ltc

[09-Jul-18 12:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that will make it much more expensive to set bobs

[09-Jul-18 12:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
specially for dICOs

[09-Jul-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but maybe txindex=1 is not needed after all as i think all is required is gettxout works and it will work even for pruned node

[09-Jul-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
none of the bobs I have set up used txindex=1

[09-Jul-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess no need for txindex=1, i just find pruned nodes much less complete

[10-Jul-18 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hey people, I need some help with BCH on my bob, to issue a `getinfo` via cli I need to do this command: 
`bch-cli -datadir=$HOME/.bch -conf=$HOME/.bch/bch.conf getinfo`
Marketmaker finds the rpcport fine, but cannot issue any calls, give this: 
`<<<<<<<<<<< A bitcoind_RPC: BCH post_process_bitcoind_RPC.getinfo`

[10-Jul-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not imperative for today, I assume this is a BCH issue, the deamon installed is bitcoin-ABC.

[10-Jul-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was already installed on the server.

[10-Jul-18 06:32 AM] jorian#4555
Wasn't it @CrisF who had the same issue?

[10-Jul-18 06:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah @jorian  @blackjok3r , I had that coming up along with ```post_process_bitcoind_RPC.listunspent
<<<<<<<<<<< A bitcoind_RPC: KMD post_process_bitcoind_RPC.getinfo
<<<<<<<<<<< A bitcoind_RPC: KMD post_process_bitcoind_RPC.validateaddress```
I got it with BCH, DASH, KMD, LTC, ZEC (I saw jl777s post about ZEC no longer working with BD) and occasionally KMD.
I've just gotten a part over from Italy and am in the process of re-reinstalling ubuntu. 
Hopefully that does the trick.
If you solve this issue please post how you did it @blackjok3r !  I've spent many hours on it (and so have some others who have patiently been helping) without success.
You can see some of it above 👆

[10-Jul-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was on KMD too, that was just a typo in the conf file.

[10-Jul-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BCH, not that... its somehting else... I assume it cannot read the conf file.

[10-Jul-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I need to manually set it path, but it ads the coins on startup fine, and says BCH : installed

[10-Jul-18 07:01 AM] CrisF#3405
I will check the komodo.conf.  It has worked before (shown my balance) with KMD without any change to the .conf though.
With the others I have tried multiple variations of .conf starting from the exact examples from guides, then adding suggestions from others and finally to trying any combination I could think of.
I also had XXX : installed and XXX : active .  No balance showed though.  Balance showed up on blockchain and in native wallets though.

[10-Jul-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are your conf files in the  default place ie komodo.conf is exactly `/home/$USER/.komodo/komodo.conf`

[10-Jul-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not, copy a copy if it to that path.

[10-Jul-18 07:31 AM] CrisF#3405
KMD, LTC, DASH and ZEC were.  BCH was on a portable ssd.  I had a symlink for that and also tried with using direct filepaths like this:   
```bch-cli -datadir=/media/tex/ssd/.bch -conf=/media/tex/ssd/.bch/bch.conf getwalletinfo```

[10-Jul-18 07:33 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll do it all from scratch when this ubuntu re-reinstall finally gets done.

[10-Jul-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, thats the part I am confused about...

[10-Jul-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can pass that info to the cli program..... but how does marketmaker know those values? I am 99% sure this is where the problem is for BCH. There are BCH bobs, so sombody knows how to fix this. @tolken

[10-Jul-18 08:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, tolken got it working.

[10-Jul-18 08:27 AM] CrisF#3405
It seemed strange for me that the symlink allowed me to issue commands with the standard ```-datadir=/home/tex/.bch -conf=bch.conf```
but marketmaker didn't seem to be able to pick that up.

[10-Jul-18 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
It wasn't able to pick up LTC  either and that was locally installed.

[10-Jul-18 08:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Since others have got it working as per the guide I'm thinking this fresh ubuntu install might help.

[10-Jul-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully. If you work out BCH please let me know, everything else works as expected form my work today. I await PTYX to test it was what he wanted though.

[10-Jul-18 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Will do.

[10-Jul-18 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
What were you working on?

[10-Jul-18 08:40 AM] NF#1854
anybody want to donate /sell bitmain coupon ?

[10-Jul-18 08:40 AM] NF#1854
if  you are not using

[10-Jul-18 09:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You need to be sure the coins file script is the same as the daemon... rpcport and homefolder

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Jul-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I think the conf file in this server may be custom, I will check that now. thanks man

[10-Jul-18 11:30 AM] tolken#2655
@CrisF it isn't strange to me that you could issue bch cli commands with that syntax as it'll create a conf anywhere you want. What's seems to be most important is ensuring the conf file is where barterDex expects it to be.

[10-Jul-18 11:32 AM] tolken#2655
Yes,  have BCH, BTC, LTC more or less working although I've run into problems of my own. I can't seem to get reliable alice trades from that machine, although bobs seem to work fairly well. I'm about to nuke my setup and build out a new setup from scratch with everything I've learned. Hopefully its just something specific to that machine.

[10-Jul-18 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, @tolken , yes, that makes sense.

[10-Jul-18 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully a fresh start will work for both of us!

[10-Jul-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@tolken I put this into the coins file on startup ( I made my own coins array just for the ones I am using on my bobs)
` {\"coin\":\"BCH\",\"name\":\"bch\",\"rpcport\":33333,\"confpath\":\"${HOME#}/.bch/bch.conf\",\"pubtype\":0,\"p2shtype\":5,\"wiftype\":128,\"txfee\":1000}]"
`

[10-Jul-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it still doesnt work

[10-Jul-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I get BCH RPC port found

[10-Jul-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it wont talk to it

[10-Jul-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I found the issue

[10-Jul-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😄 it's alive

[10-Jul-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
restarted deamon, so it was reading the right rpc/user pass.

{Reactions}
👏 

[10-Jul-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and putting the confpath part solved the problem.

It had a swap never started due to a firewall, I did not know was installed. I removed that, then we tried a second swap. And it got stuck there.

[10-Jul-18 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181

wasnt on latest marketmaker dev, updated and funded more UTXO, now I seem to have a swap going through.

[10-Jul-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
At one point I had a tab in my GUI that listed out all of the addresses and privkeys for the coins loaded. It's been so long that I can't recall how I did it. Is there a singular call that will spit out privkeys rather than using a foreach loop?

[10-Jul-18 09:00 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r  Great! I'll give that a try too.

[11-Jul-18 10:09 AM] Mylo#8306
anyone here know where the etomic faucet is?

[11-Jul-18 06:04 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Hello, all. I've got a problem, and I don't know who to ask so I'm just going to blurt it out here. I just found out that I have been mining my ZEC to a watch-only wallet address, and after doing some reading online, I think the issue might have something to do with barterDEX

[11-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Does BarterDEX make watch-only addresses in existing wallet files in my appdata?

[11-Jul-18 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It doesn't "make them" it adds them to watch for balance changes, hence the name "watch only"

[11-Jul-18 06:06 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
ok. well...is it possible for these addresses to show up under "owned addresses" tab in WinZEC?

[11-Jul-18 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
how a given coin handles display of watch only is up to the devs of that given coin

[11-Jul-18 06:08 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Ok. Just so we're clear, I'm not here to complain about it. I'm just trying to find out if there is a way I can recover my zec.

[11-Jul-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
of note: watch only is part of the base Bitcoin protocol and not created by komodo or zec
@jl777c **might** be able to help here

[11-Jul-18 06:11 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I just hope I haven't mucked it up with everything I've done after the fact to try to fix this also.

[11-Jul-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
you sent funds to a watchonly address?

[11-Jul-18 06:11 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
yes.

[11-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
well technically Bitfly did

[11-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
but I told them to

[11-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
so blame ultimately lands on me. I'm just looking for help now.

[11-Jul-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
which txid? need to get the KMD format of that address and hope it is held by a friendly. then they could send it back to you

[11-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
That is over my head a bit. I have never actually used barterDEX, I installed it to check it out, but beyond that it's just been taking up space on my drive. Is txid Transaction ID? All of those transactions are .01 payments from flypool

[11-Jul-18 06:22 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
...They don't all make sense I guess.

[11-Jul-18 06:25 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I see now that bitfly sends it out from a private address in big chunks of .01 payments to a lot of addresses at once.

[11-Jul-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so KMD address RSFbxLWBacSPro4KF1Y8fPH7dosa9bHniL is who has those coins

[11-Jul-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
unfortunately it isnt my address. you will need to ask around to see who has that address and hope they are kind enough to send you the ZEC you kindly had sent to them

[11-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
lol

[11-Jul-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not an active KMD address...

[11-Jul-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so likely someone else who was trying out the DEX

[11-Jul-18 06:28 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I see. what are the chances that that address is on my machine? Much of this is beyond my expertise, like I said.

[11-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
And  are we sure that this address was generated by barterDEX?

[11-Jul-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I am sure of nothing, only the data you posted here. for all I know your passphrase generates that address. not sure how you got that address

[11-Jul-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
in barterDEX or hyperDEX what address do you get if you put in your passphrase

[11-Jul-18 06:31 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
🤔

[11-Jul-18 06:40 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Ok, so after I discovered this problem, I rage dumped winZEC, and barterdex from my machine, but I have the wallet file and I have my barterdex password written down. Later today, I will try to restore the wallet, open barterDEX and see...what happens.
