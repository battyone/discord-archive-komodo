@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 thanks for response - I'm so noobie I don't really know how to answer that - I just do the recommended curl and pipe to jq - worked before, but not after mm2 update

[10-Oct-19 04:38 PM] allbits#5898
only the method:orderbook call is messy - things like my_balance, setprice, etc work fine

[10-Oct-19 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@allbits add `-s` to your curl and try `jq -c`

[10-Oct-19 04:38 PM] allbits#5898

I'm assuming that the
```json
"price_rat":[
[1,[43576923]],
[1,[50000000]]
]```
bit is the bit that you're not liking the format of
you can always use jq to further parse those bits however you want

[10-Oct-19 04:45 PM] allbits#5898
yes, that's the part that's splashing all over the screen

[10-Oct-19 04:46 PM] allbits#5898
but I can't figure out how to further parse those to keep them on one line

[10-Oct-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
2624 characters takes up screen real-estate no matter what you do
I'd suggest familiarizing yourself with <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/> and making it display only the bits you want and how you want to work with them

[10-Oct-19 04:50 PM] allbits#5898
ok - I'll give that a try.  Thank you

[10-Oct-19 11:20 PM] allbits#5898
Unfortunately I've gotten nowhere in terms of being able to understand jq sufficiently to take out all the line breaks that started appearing once I updated mm2. Any help or ideas appreciated.

[11-Oct-19 05:36 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@allbits You may remove the rational representations from output by 
```
ORDERBOOK | jq -M 'del(.. | .price_rat?)' | jq -M 'del(.. | .max_volume_rat?)'
```
Maybe there's more elegant solution using jq only once, but this snippet just works.

[11-Oct-19 06:41 AM] jorian#4555
or use jq select to only select the ones you want

[11-Oct-19 09:03 PM] Ian#3705
Whoops - i had missed the installation of cmake .. my bad !

[11-Oct-19 11:22 PM] Ian#3705
Is it possible to enable an RPC connect to the MArket Maker from another host (yes i know the security implications - this is just for developing stuff)

[12-Oct-19 12:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yes, it is possible.

[12-Oct-19 12:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
instead of using 127.0.0.1 as the IP, set it to the external IP address.

[13-Oct-19 02:54 AM] Ian#3705
The problem is that the Market Maker process rejects connection attempts from other hosts - if it was, for example, a Bitcoin derived node you could specify a parameter to allow specific IP and/or subnets in - i was hoping for an equivalent Market Maker parameter - i can do it by tunnelling but i don't really want to resort to that

[13-Oct-19 06:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are you trying to run a native daemon remotely and link it to mm2, or issue RPC commands to a remote mm2 instance?

[13-Oct-19 06:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I know the second one works, because I've done it. First one, havent tested, but probably just simpler to use electrum.

[13-Oct-19 08:55 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Orders I place on the mm2 cli don't seem to appear on oracle or on my mobile app. Usually only 1 does. Is that normal?

[13-Oct-19 08:57 AM] Oszy#5734
`only 1 does` no either all should show or none 游뗵 oracle is not realtime i takes time to update, on mobile app i can see my setprice orders within 15-20 seconds usually

[13-Oct-19 09:47 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
It seems like only my last order appears. I can see them all when I do ./myorders.sh on my cli, but only 1 on the app and oracle. 1 per pair it looks like. I have cancel previous or whatever it is set to false

[13-Oct-19 09:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if order is for same pair, I think it replaces previous

[13-Oct-19 10:14 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
How can the book ever get filled then?

[13-Oct-19 10:21 AM] cipi#4502
https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#setprice
you need to set `cancel_previous` to `false` (default is true)

I have that set to false

[13-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator if that is actually the case, then I wouldn't expect the order book to have many orders ever.

[13-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
This is already drastically more complicated than most users will ever want to deal with

[13-Oct-19 10:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mobile is simple. most users are likely to be looking for single trades. Traders may want to have 202 different price points across the spread, and guis may be created for them to do so. Its pretty new tech, CLI is slightly complicated but if you want to live on the edge its how it is.

[13-Oct-19 10:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
compare it to something like shapeshift - I dont think traders were setting up 202 price spreads there.

[13-Oct-19 10:30 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
But why call it marketmaker2 if you can't actually market make with it?

[13-Oct-19 10:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I could be wrong. `cancel_previous` implies more than one can coexist

[13-Oct-19 10:31 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
That is what I assumed as well

[13-Oct-19 10:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dont think I have that flag set in my TUI, will check

[13-Oct-19 10:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yah, I got it set to `true`, so when global market prices update, my prices update without leaving old orders sitting there with old prices/.

[13-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Ian#3705
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I was planning to run MM2 remotely - connecting to native nodes is not a problem and yes i know electrum is an option.  I was just wondering if there was config in MM2 allowing connections FROM other hosts similar to the way you can allow remote connections to a node

[13-Oct-19 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are you using an MM2.json file?

[13-Oct-19 01:14 PM] cipher#6886
Hi All, I'd love to MM on Komodo and have the resources to quote any market with a thin spread up to $1,000 worth.  Are there any dev programs which can help finance the costs to keep my engines running as I don't see enough flow on the dex itself to make it worthwhile - thoughts?

[13-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Oszy#5734
#talk-entrepreneurship maybe

[13-Oct-19 06:49 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
So my question remains, if I have cancel previous set to false, should my multiple orders appear on the books and if so why aren't they?

[14-Oct-19 01:06 AM] Ian#3705
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Yeah am using MM2.json but i can't find any docs for the options available

[14-Oct-19 01:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
add the `"rpcip":"0.0.0.0"` key value to MM2.json (replace 0.0.0.0 with external IP) and `"rpc_local_only":false`

[14-Oct-19 02:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Patrick Crypto I'll check this later today. try different capitalisation for false/False

[14-Oct-19 02:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are they showing up https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#my-orders ?

Did you download it from releases page? https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases. It hasn't been updated for a while, this version is pretty old. It doesn't support multiple orders per 1 pair that's why your orders are not shown up on other nodes.

[14-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Oszy#5734
do a git checkout and a cargo clean then build again

I made a cli buy seven hours ago. I bought dex with kmd. My taker payment was made into the b address and then sent from b address to the maker. The maker payment was made into the b address. This all happened within five minutes after the swap initiated. However, the dex remains in the b address and has not been paid to me - seven hours have expired. Seems a serious issue?

[15-Oct-19 05:19 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@allbits Hi, could you DM your failed swap uuid to me please?

[15-Oct-19 05:36 AM] Oszy#5734

@Oszy Yes, it should help, but I'd also like to know also why the swap failed initially so I need uuid to check it's status.

@allbits did you try and buy the very cheap DEX at 11.something KMD?

[15-Oct-19 01:37 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@allbits MM2 attempted to spend maker payment, but failed with: `the transaction was rejected by network rules.\\n\\n16: tx-overwinter-active`. Coins config file should be also updated with latest MM2 to work properly, please use it from https://github.com/jl777/coins. Restart MM2 after coins file update and then use `recover_funds_of_swap` with uuid you provided: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#recover-funds-of-swap

[15-Oct-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
in mm1 we used `source coins` in the init script and added `\"coins\":$coins` to the mm run params (I'd assume that bit is still the same, no?)

[15-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Oszy#5734
you can definitely script the coin activation over the electrums (if not using native wallets) after mm2 started but mm2 has no coin launch param afaik, it activates natives from `coins`
