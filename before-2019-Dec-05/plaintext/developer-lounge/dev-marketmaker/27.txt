I'm looking at the line ``error: failed to run custom build command for `common v0.1.0 (/home/administrator/atomicDEX-API/mm2src/common)``

[22-Nov-19 02:56 PM] phm87#7395
Maybe it will be painful to make it work on ubuntu 16.04 : I think that most of mm2 ubuntu are on 18.04, I can use docker

[22-Nov-19 02:59 PM] gcharang#6833
I am using 16.04 though

[22-Nov-19 03:04 PM] phm87#7395
Did you add a PPA ?

[22-Nov-19 03:06 PM] phm87#7395
Can you show me the commands that you typed ? I'm creating a new VM to start fresh, I can try with ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 (I'm more used to 16.04 though)

but the error is indeed related to cmake, I'll try to look at that

[22-Nov-19 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's something `sudo` things, just guessing

[22-Nov-19 04:59 PM] Slyris#2880
@phm87 It's not related with CMake version.

When you run CMake it's creating a cache files and directory inside the build directory.

The error here here mean's that :

1st- The cache variable containing the project variable name  (CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME) is erased
2nd - project_name() is not set in the CMakeLists.txt

[22-Nov-19 05:00 PM] Slyris#2880
So the problem is probably the 1st one, you could use grep insinde the build directory to see if the variable is set

[22-Nov-19 05:00 PM] Slyris#2880
(The variable should be in the CMakeCache.txt)

[22-Nov-19 05:01 PM] phm87#7395
I made a cargo clean then build again. I will make a grep after the build. Thank you

[22-Nov-19 05:02 PM] Slyris#2880
Check also with which rights you are running CMake

[22-Nov-19 05:02 PM] Slyris#2880
Did you clone the project as sudo ?

[22-Nov-19 05:22 PM] phm87#7395
no I didn't use sudo to git clone not to build. I used sudo only to add dependancies

@phm87 hey, I deleted the  terminal output you posted because it seemed to contain the actual rpcpass and passphrase, no doubt your brain was lagging a bit after all that troubleshooting üòú 

sorry if they aren't real

[23-Nov-19 09:34 AM] phm87#7395
@gcharang  there is only MORTY on these keys but it is better to avoid to share passphrases, thank you.
I was able to make the tutorial/walkthrough, I created 2 orders but I'm waiting for a match (I let mm2 running in a screen), how long should I wait ?
Another question about prices, is it mandatory to parse the orderbook to know the last buy & sell prices (best buy price and best sell price) ? Or does it exist a single call to know all prices of all coins ?

[23-Nov-19 10:24 AM] phm87#7395
On MM2, do we have a similar call to know all supported coins on mm2 ? (similar to ``getcoins`` from mm1 <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/mmV1/api/general.html#getcoins>)

[23-Nov-19 10:26 AM] phm87#7395
``get_enabled_coins`` returns only the user enabled coins but I'd like to have all supported coins, thank you

[23-Nov-19 11:19 AM] cipi#4502
the supported coins are in the coins file: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins
the ones with `"mm2": 1`, the others were not tested with mm2 or are not working in mm2

[23-Nov-19 01:41 PM] phm87#7395
@cipi and about the prices ? Should I perform one call for each coin ? Or can I get the prices for all coins with one call ?

[23-Nov-19 01:42 PM] phm87#7395
Now, I'm planning to retrieve orderbook for each coin, it is not efficient (I only need the best buy/sell, not whole orderbook)

[23-Nov-19 02:25 PM] cipi#4502
these are the available API calls: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html
there is no API call for bestprice, so you need to query the orderbook

>  I created 2 orders but I'm waiting for a match (I let mm2 running in a screen), how long should I wait ?
you have to wait till some one fills your order

[23-Nov-19 05:57 PM] phm87#7395
I tried to use the same price and volume that match another order in the orderbook but I didn't pay attention to bid / ask, I'll create other orders, thank you

[23-Nov-19 06:11 PM] SHossain#0007
what command did use to match another order?

[23-Nov-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
`setprice` or `buy`?

[23-Nov-19 06:18 PM] phm87#7395
I used ``curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"RICK\",\"rel\":\"MORTY\"}" | jq`` then I used my eyes to try to match an order but I didn't pay attention to bids and asks lists, I created a second order trying to sell 1 MORTY to receive 1 RICK. But the trading part can be dangerous (for the purpose I'd like to do) so I'll focus first on get prices and get balances and in a few days, swaps and trading

[23-Nov-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
that's `orderbook` command

[23-Nov-19 06:19 PM] phm87#7395
I used a ``buy`` as they explain in <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/master/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.md> but I'll sell RICK from my phone to be sure that my orders are matched

[23-Nov-19 06:19 PM] phm87#7395
thank you for your help

[23-Nov-19 10:06 PM] phm87#7395
I though that KOIN was mm2 compotible because it is an assetchain/smartchain (but maybe it is another KOIN here), I don't see ``"mm2": 1`` here for KOIN: <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L172>

[23-Nov-19 10:28 PM] cipi#4502
assetchains will work, only OOT and ZILLA are special (no sapling)

[23-Nov-19 10:28 PM] phm87#7395
but in the help, they explain to use only the coins with mm2: 1

[23-Nov-19 10:29 PM] cipi#4502
yes, because that are the tested ones... do a KOIN trade, then it is tested üôÇ

```Notes on the MM2 Parameter
For each coin, Komodo software requires the user/developer to set the mm2 parameter. This can be achieved either in the coins for more details), or via the electrum and enable methods.

The value of the mm2 parameter informs the software as to whether the coin is expected to function.

0 = non-functioning
1 = functioning```
But in some cases, there is no mm2 parameter

[23-Nov-19 10:30 PM] phm87#7395

[23-Nov-19 10:32 PM] phm87#7395
no clues

[23-Nov-19 10:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@cipi we are notarizing KOIN

[23-Nov-19 10:41 PM] phm87#7395
yes, that's why I know it exists but we are notarizing several projects that I have never see any life in their channel so the question of cipi makes sense (maybe only notaries uses it now)

[24-Nov-19 01:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Looks like If you create a new zTOMIC coin - you could blend the zcash light wallet in to Adex ...use a 24 word seed and  ...."swap"... zaddress coins.....at least it looks like you can from my couch.

If the other tool needs a server reboot, mm2 won t be affdcted. And vice versa

there is a rpc call to know my own swap history but I'd really be happy to be able to know history of the whole atomicdex. The only written track are blockchains of both assets. How can I identify an old atomic swap from blockchain data ? I don't know if electrum will be enough to gather this info. I hope that I'll see something specific in the op_return

[25-Nov-19 11:00 PM] cipi#4502

problem with dexfee address is, that it covers only the swaps where the taker has used KMD. If he bought KMD and payed with BTC, the dexfee will be in BTC and payed to some other address.

[26-Nov-19 04:40 PM] gcharang#6833
another problem is, dexfee might be paid but the swap could still fail
I am not sure if it should be counted as volume

I performed some swaps yesterday between atomicdex-api and AtomicDEX (on smartphone) on RICK and MORTY and I noticed that:
- I can't match my own orders. If I create a sell and a buy that should match with the same client, nothing happens (I used ``setprice``)
- I was able to swap if I create orders from atomicdex-api with ``setprice`` then create the matching orders on atomicdex from my phone
- I'm testing but it doesn't seem to work to create new orders with my phone then create the matching order with atomicdex-api using ``setprice``
Should I use ``buy`` sometimes ? How can I know when I should use ``buy``, ``sell`` or ``setprice`` ?
But I don't use <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#note-about-rational-number-type> but it doesn't work with round numbers 0.5 / 1 / 2 so I don't think that it is number type bug.

> If I create a sell and a buy that should match with the same client, nothing happens (I used setprice) 
I'm not sure i understand this one, but if i'm correct a send / buy is something that is broadcasted on the network. if in 30 seconds no reply comes in, it will be converted from taker to maker and will be put in the orderbook for others to buy / sell

[29-Nov-19 09:20 AM] jorian#4555
> I was able to swap if I create orders from atomicdex-api with setprice then create the matching orders on atomicdex from my phone
This is how it normally works; setprice is when you want to make a market

[29-Nov-19 09:20 AM] jorian#4555
in fact, every unmatched buy / sell will eventually become a setprice, conceptually

[29-Nov-19 09:21 AM] jorian#4555
> it doesn't seem to work to create new orders with my phone then create the matching order with atomicdex-api using setprice
that is because setprice isn't a taker order

> If I create a sell and a buy that should match with the same client, nothing happens (I used setprice) 
sorry I mean that I used ``setprice`` to swap 1 RICK to 1 MORTY and I did a second call with the same client/wallet to swap 1 MORTY to 1 RICK, it didn't work (but I think that it is because it was done from the same client/wallet)

ok so if I want to make sure to succeed to places orders and have matching, I'll try with ``buy`` instead of ``setprice``
