Do you mean I should try the address passphrase in the passphrase script in SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts?

[30-Jun-18 04:58 PM] CrisF#3405
(mine are different)

[30-Jun-18 05:00 PM] tolken#2655
@CrisF yes, check the guide again, it explains that step

[30-Jun-18 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, every passphrase has unique addresses tied to it
If you want to use "this is my pass" to create a specific add, then you have to use "this is my pass" as your passphrase in mm
If you use "this is my other pass" for mm, then mm will not be able to access "this is my pass" addys

[30-Jun-18 05:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I see they are the same now.

[30-Jun-18 05:01 PM] CrisF#3405
They haven't been previously though.

[30-Jun-18 05:04 PM] CrisF#3405
I've re-pasted them in case of typos.

I did `getcoins` and the addresses came up allright for the ones I know.

[30-Jun-18 05:12 PM] CrisF#3405
```{
        "coin": "LTC",
        "installed": true,
        "height": 0,
        "balance": 0,
        "KMDvalue": 0,

        "smartaddress": "LZ8v9pR7a4j2zy7BDRU5MdQztwBDWmm8YD",

        "p2shtype": 5,
        "wiftype": 176,
        "txfee": 100000
    }```

[30-Jun-18 05:14 PM] CrisF#3405
I used insomnia for it due to the mass of text and have no other beautifier.

[30-Jun-18 05:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Still 0 balance, but installed and active.

[30-Jun-18 05:15 PM] tolken#2655
Are you calling using the new/updated pass?

[30-Jun-18 05:15 PM] tolken#2655
you need to set it at bdex start, and use it for each call

[30-Jun-18 05:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I stopped bdex, repasted the passphrases, ./cllient, setuserpass then enabled coins.

[30-Jun-18 05:18 PM] cipi#4502
if the transactions to the address LZ8v9pR7a4j2zy7BDRU5MdQztwBDWmm8YD were made before this address was succesfully imported into the wallet, you need to rescan in order to see the correct balance

[30-Jun-18 05:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, they would be on this pc.

[30-Jun-18 05:21 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll rescan and give it a try in the morning.

[30-Jun-18 05:21 PM] cipi#4502
BarterDEX only sees the utxos associated with that smartaddress, the other ones are not visible

[30-Jun-18 05:23 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks for all the help @tolken , @ComputerGenie , @cipi

Does calling a listunspent work in other coins, btc, bch etc when it‚Äôs not a local daemon your running? Seems to work for local KMD daemon, and for remote KMD, but not other coins.

[01-Jul-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
listunspent api works

[01-Jul-18 03:03 PM] tolken#2655
For remote bch/btc ?

[01-Jul-18 03:03 PM] tolken#2655
Doesn‚Äôt seem to work for other coins, unless local

[01-Jul-18 03:07 PM] tolken#2655
Tried on the BTC address in orderbook ending in: A47a

[01-Jul-18 03:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
when using a remote wallet (i.e., electrum) you must take into account that lag exists and it will effect apps that have real-time returns

[01-Jul-18 03:09 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm all native for what it‚Äôs worth.

[01-Jul-18 03:10 PM] tolken#2655
Other than my btc address I only see one other btc addrsss reporting UTXOs with a maxvol > 0 on orderbooks which is A47a

[01-Jul-18 03:12 PM] tolken#2655
You suspect most of these are electrum?

[01-Jul-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not sure the API was meant to give you unspent return for a not you addy

[01-Jul-18 03:14 PM] tolken#2655
It does for not-your KMD address, but with jl777s response above I‚Äôm not clear if that means it should work on other coins or not

[01-Jul-18 03:15 PM] tolken#2655
It‚Äôs a cool feature or it does work, but could be abused I guess.

[01-Jul-18 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, if an electrum server gives you every scrap of info about any addy you ask, then that's a flaw and can lead to much abuse of the electrum

[01-Jul-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it does

[01-Jul-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
native listunspent only works for address in wallet or being watched, it isnt magic

[01-Jul-18 03:19 PM] tolken#2655
Or being watched... ok, I‚Äôll read up more on that. Thanks üòÉ I see lots of addresses being watched, not entirely sure how that works.

[01-Jul-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
watched = telling your wallet, "I know it's not mine and I can't interact with it, but I want you to keep track of it"

[01-Jul-18 03:25 PM] tolken#2655
cool, so just need to see how easy it is to add / remove addresses of interest to wallet before calling listspent.  Sounds good.

[01-Jul-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
once you add a watch, you can't remove it (afaik)

[01-Jul-18 03:27 PM] tolken#2655
damn. commitment.

[02-Jul-18 12:32 PM] tolken#2655
I keep getting a lot of ‚Äúpending‚Äù when I do a pending api call for coins that I‚Äôm not trading. Like HYD and COQUI. I have a very specific/small list of coins I have defined with autoprice and these aren‚Äôt on it. It‚Äôs updating fairly frequently. As of yesterday these weren‚Äôt showing up. Is pending showing me anything other than my trades on BarterDex? Where are these coming from?

[02-Jul-18 12:47 PM] tolken#2655
Something keeps reserving my UTXOs, not clear what it is.

[02-Jul-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
are you 100% sure you arent using the same passphrase on a different node?

[02-Jul-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
pending should only be your pending swaps from DB/SWAPS

[02-Jul-18 01:53 PM] tolken#2655
Honestly I‚Äôm rarely if ever 100% on anything. However I can say definitively I only have one node running on my end. If that‚Äôs happening then my keys are compromised but I don‚Äôt see any exodus of funds or trades actually going through that ultimately deplete my funds. @jl777c

[02-Jul-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what does recentswaps return?

[02-Jul-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
with a limit of 10+

[02-Jul-18 01:55 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôll get that to you shortly, when I return to machine. Yeah DB/SWAPS only has some recent kmd/bch bob trades, which I have active autoprice on. I‚Äôll get recentswaps and report back.

[02-Jul-18 02:43 PM] tolken#2655
@jl777c  To clarify, I was using the pendings script, which calls the statsdisplay method which shows those odd tradepairs/swaps. Recentswaps reports back what I expect:
```
{"result":"success","swaps":[[844743303, 2306499465], [1134733033, 1743156164], [4175885511, 198107718], [2958541873, 1425051760, {"KMD":-14.32694505,"BCH":0.02947629,"price":0.00205740}], [305081040, 3840877055, {"KMD":-53.40260208,"BCH":0.11151070,"price":0.00208811}], [3837462663, 543860252, {"KMD":-16.25822886,"BCH":0.03480471,"price":0.00214074}], [4173602401, 1138899551], [3735533082, 4152000862], [3761948501, 469268998], [3822826847, 4279390021, {"KMD":-6.79815130,"BCH":0.01508999,"price":0.00221972}]],"netamounts":[{"KMD":-90.78592729}, {"BCH":0.19088169}]}
```

[02-Jul-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe pendings is reporting all pending swaps from everyone

[02-Jul-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
use recentswaps

[02-Jul-18 04:08 PM] tolken#2655
Data doesn‚Äôt seem nearly as thorough. I‚Äôd like something that gives me insight what may be reserving my UTXOs looking at the DB/SWAPS data should reveal most of this, but recentswaps seems like a less descriptive set of data. No uuids, dates/times.

[02-Jul-18 04:12 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôll dig around a bit more, I think all of the data is here, not not sure what the easiest place to collect it.

[02-Jul-18 04:13 PM] tolken#2655
DBSWAPS is giving me most of what I need, other than potentially knowing if/when a specific UTXO is reserved by a resent request.

[02-Jul-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
there is an api that lists utxo that are reserved

are these meaningful on the user (me) end or pure debug?

[03-Jul-18 12:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it doesn't seem to effect trades, but I seem to be getting them frequently (for both alice fee and alice payment) even after a complete rescan (linux & komodod native SUPERNET) and nothing else using that wallet or addy

[03-Jul-18 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i also noticed those recently, but it doesnt seem to affect things. will try to track it down

[03-Jul-18 09:46 AM] bartwr#6773
Question:

I would like to make a web page that shows my recent swaps using JavaScript / nodejs. 

Is it possible to request my recent swaps via a POST request to a SPV node?

I was thinking of something like

```    request({
      uri: 'http://electrum2.cipig.net:10000',
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        userpass: config.userpass,
        method: 'recentswaps',
        limit: 500
      })
    });```


This doesn't work. Maybe I have to use an other IP? Other suggestions?

[03-Jul-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
localhost port 7784 for marketmaker api, electrum is for electrum api

[03-Jul-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie that was a spurious error, unless you see a "second couldnt add..." it is just a bit of a delay for things to update

[03-Jul-18 10:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
often there were 2, from a visual aspect it was almost as if internal listunspent and duscombine had to run 2-3 times before it would take

[03-Jul-18 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
in some instances there were second "second"s

[03-Jul-18 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
again, it doesn't seem to have any impact on trades, just anomalous to see

[03-Jul-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810

[08-Jul-18 07:33 PM] tolken#2655
What‚Äôs the general consensus with BarterDex‚Äôs performance at the moment? I‚Äôve been following/using it for quite some time now and believe I have a fairly good understanding of how  it generally works, perhaps better than 95% then most. I tend to only use cli as my goal is to build out liquidity for Bdex for lots of different pairs. I‚Äôve put months of work out of my limited spare time in the morning, lunch breaks etc, learning and getting it working to the best of my ability.

[08-Jul-18 07:35 PM] tolken#2655
Now I say this not to ruffle any feathers, I know everyone is working hard and these are difficult problems to solve. My perception at this point is that our primary issue is that we don‚Äôt have enough bobs. Of course there‚Äôs an acknowledgment that more work is needed hence he mm2.0 efforts.

[08-Jul-18 07:36 PM] tolken#2655
Based on my limited experience, I suspect more bobs isn‚Äôt going to radically improve the amount of trades.

[08-Jul-18 07:37 PM] tolken#2655
I wouldn‚Äôt ever rule out that my configuration isn‚Äôt at fault, but it seems to me that assetchains swap nearly effortlessly, particularly in native mode.

[08-Jul-18 07:41 PM] tolken#2655
Looking at the last 10 pages on atomicexplorer, it seems mine maybe only 10% of all swaps are non-asset chains swaps. Is this coincidence, or is there something that eludes is that‚Äôs causing a barrier to reliable matching of non-assetchain coins?

[08-Jul-18 07:43 PM] tolken#2655
I know jl777 can‚Äôt be the only one with all the answers, so I hate to bug him, but I want to push this forward; I want to help, I hope that‚Äôs clear from my persistence.

[08-Jul-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is strange assetchains work fine but other coins dont

[08-Jul-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
I have been swapping against BTC and it seems to work decently

[08-Jul-18 07:47 PM] tolken#2655
It does occasionally work, just very inconsistent compared to assetchains. Had an ltc alice buy trade go through yesterday, now bobs don‚Äôt seem to accept. I guess it could just be bad bobs, but just seems fishy.

[08-Jul-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
my guess is that if I set up some bobs for a coin, it would be reliable

[08-Jul-18 07:52 PM] tolken#2655
my bobs have seen many trades as well, but it‚Äôs difficult to measure just how many trades never even match.

[08-Jul-18 07:54 PM] jorian#4555
how can a bob be bad? 
- bad connection
- utxo flooded wallet (though that even seems to work, only slower)

[08-Jul-18 07:55 PM] jorian#4555
but there still (in the case of CHIPS) are a lot of unfinished trades. trades that don't connect, get connected or get quote validate error -2's

[08-Jul-18 07:55 PM] jorian#4555
while there is plenty of liquidity

[08-Jul-18 07:55 PM] tolken#2655
well if these bad bobs can take down bdex as they seem to be capable of, not sure how much future this dex tech has.

[08-Jul-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i think things need to evolve toward a set of preferred bobs

[08-Jul-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and a much more aggressive reputation system

[08-Jul-18 07:57 PM] tolken#2655
Maybe we need a bob ‚Äúmost wanted‚Äù poster, so when we find shitty bobs, we can try and hammer them until we find it definitively what is the problem. Rule out UTXOs issues, that sort of thing.

[08-Jul-18 07:58 PM] tolken#2655
Would it be too much of a network bottleneck/security issue to be able to probe a bob for more info?

[08-Jul-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
I can try to find time next week to setup reliable bobs for a  non-assetchain coin

[08-Jul-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it really is the same as an assetchain, mm doesnt really differentiate

[08-Jul-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and KMD is a real coin and it works just fine

[08-Jul-18 07:59 PM] tolken#2655
if it ever works for me like kmd assetchains presently do, it‚Äôs going to be night and day difference.

[08-Jul-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
you have native daemons with txindex=1?

[08-Jul-18 08:02 PM] tolken#2655
I may not have txindex=1 on all chains, I do on at least one though. I followed a few guides which weren‚Äôt consistent so I wasn‚Äôt consistent with my confitg. I can ensure they all are though.

[08-Jul-18 08:02 PM] tolken#2655
I believe ltc and btc I used it

[08-Jul-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
without txindex=1 bobs wont do too well

[08-Jul-18 08:03 PM] tolken#2655
But maybe not on bch

[08-Jul-18 08:03 PM] tolken#2655
bch has been most prolific bob though. But I‚Äôll doublecheck

[08-Jul-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
check your LTC bob

[08-Jul-18 08:05 PM] tolken#2655
Will do

[08-Jul-18 08:23 PM] tolken#2655
Just checked, btc and bch, both don‚Äôt, but ltc does have txindex=1. Maybe just luck, but both bch has been bob trading successfully (one just started actually) for weeks now. Btc has traded at least one bob trade. Ltc, haven‚Äôt dont a bob trade yet, but one Alice.
