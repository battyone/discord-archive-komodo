as far as I can see, all the pieces are in place. all we need to do is test a bit to see if scale is linear and where the pressure points are

[24-Jun-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its amazing how much things have changed from my first PoC...

[24-Jun-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but the general idea is about 100x better than out first attempt.

[24-Jun-18 12:54 PM] CrisF#3405
You've really done some work cutting down the requirements.  My vps is 8/32 and it quickly became irrelevant.

[24-Jun-18 12:55 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm running on a 20-sided dice at the moment

Passing off the heavy lifting to AWS with autoscale was a god send.

the only point of failure was the place where all the stats are pushed to. and Lambda and DynamoDB can scale to some absolutly crazy numbers... we are at like 0.1% of its capacity even with 8196 chains... technically if this test goes well... someone could for the repos and deploy 32,000 chains or even 100,000 if they can get enough vCPU's from AWS/Google lol

[24-Jun-18 12:57 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
10 seconds...

[24-Jun-18 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm seems my random delay was backwards... needs to be minus not plus lol.. some chains started early

[24-Jun-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think overall, all the numbers look better now.

[24-Jun-18 01:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
anyone got suggestion for good screen recorder?

[24-Jun-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i think my laptop has just plain ffmpg for it... but I have not used it

[24-Jun-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
numbers look heaps more accurate and flatter now üòÑ

We would only need to put the blocknotify script onto a single NotaryNode or seed node for all KMD assetchains, and we could adapt this site for a KMD Tx/s easily. Saves only using it this once.... Considering the amount of man hours gone into making it.

We are down to 2 read 2 writes on Dynamo DB, this brings us to 256/256 for all chains. Comes in at $150 USD per month, so $5 for a day. LOL

[24-Jun-18 02:03 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that's well cheap

[24-Jun-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
very much so lol

50GB per 64 chains after completed test.

Thats with this test, which is pretty long.  Kind of puts in perspective just how many transactions this is. Like why and what would ever need this amount of transaction capacity... its many many times the size of VISA lol.

how  use exchain?

[25-Jun-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry what do you mean?

[25-Jun-18 04:48 AM] Mylo#8306
I‚Äôve got this cool chrome extension that records a tab or whole desktop.  Free version with watermark or $18usd for a license.  I‚Äôve got license version so if u need screen recording I can no probs.
I have much less (order of magnitude) less work on this week woohoo!

[25-Jun-18 04:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Will be online most of week

[25-Jun-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool. On the next test we will use more chains, so it might be a good idea to record that one fully and uplaod it somewhere for marketing to use.

[25-Jun-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Now we have the site working, and the first 64 pretty much done, we need to get kubernetes cluster setup for the other 8132 chains. Then run a live test of 128 or 256 chains to test if the stats site scales linearly or not.

[25-Jun-18 05:42 AM] Mark81#4505
Do we have link to test view site?

[25-Jun-18 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[25-Jun-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know that the live stats are accurate but the stats that get saved to DB for later view are still a bit silly... then need more smoothing out.

[25-Jun-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mark81

[25-Jun-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain  can we get that link pinned to the main post... most of the stuff in the pin in now old and not used.

[25-Jun-18 08:49 AM] SHossain#0007
Pinned a message.

[25-Jun-18 08:49 AM] SHossain#0007
done

[25-Jun-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks... Once I have the new stuff ready I will give it to you to update the pin. Have a few things to sort out first though.

May I speak to the marketing team?

more likely if you go to #komodo-team instead of #dev-scalability  üòâ

[26-Jun-18 12:01 AM] kuzmanovicb#6772
there is no website for website exchange (like www.binance..) its just app right?

[26-Jun-18 03:08 AM] Mylo#8306
hey @blackjok3r  reckon we could transfer some of the billing from my AWS account into the credits you guys got?

[26-Jun-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cannot get EC2 working on KomodoPlatform account

[26-Jun-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how much is the bill?

[26-Jun-18 03:08 AM] Mylo#8306
ah ok.  $200.

[26-Jun-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not too bad.. we used a fair bit of Ec2 so far on that account. Everything else was on my personal account and I migrated it over to KomodoPlatform yesterday.. I have emailed AWS about the EC2 problem, hopefully they fix soon.

[26-Jun-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ask jl about refund I guess...

[26-Jun-18 03:10 AM] Mylo#8306
sweet.  50 hours of m4.16x instance seems to be the killer.  yeah i'll ask him next week when the bill comes due

[26-Jun-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep cool. yeah we had to do a lot of tests to get things working.

[26-Jun-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each test is about $20, but they add up fast

[26-Jun-18 03:11 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah, not a drama

[26-Jun-18 03:11 AM] Mylo#8306
i just logged in to see when the IAM roles were last used.  i'll wait til everything is working on the KP account before disabling.

[26-Jun-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wish you could do a 64GB 64cpu instance lol it would be even cheaper again.

[26-Jun-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
256gb ram is wayyy too much

[26-Jun-18 03:13 AM] Mylo#8306
how'd you go with dynamodb for update to stats site?  did you come up with better queries?

[26-Jun-18 03:13 AM] Mylo#8306
and are they in serverless, or you made some other custom stuff?

[26-Jun-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man we nailed it üòÑ

üëè 

[26-Jun-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it sends to DynamoDB with a time to live of 4 mins

[26-Jun-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then smk uses the vogels? to pull a scan directly to his server every 5s

[26-Jun-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it filteres out any results already received.

[26-Jun-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and calcualtes form there. we got it working almost 100% last night after 5h of fucking around debugging

[26-Jun-18 03:15 AM] Mylo#8306
oh nice, yeah he found vogels and i tested it out.  it got forked to something called `dynogels` which i'm testing atm cos it's got more recent updates and a bit of support

[26-Jun-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
64 chains is 2 reads and 2 writes

[26-Jun-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
less than $2 a month üòÆ

[26-Jun-18 03:15 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah debugging developer-experience of serverless stuff with js is a bit not-so-fun üòÉ

[26-Jun-18 03:15 AM] Mylo#8306
wow 2r 2w.  is that all you needed?

[26-Jun-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mostly smk's problem.. I just had to stay awake to control blast chains.

[26-Jun-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for 64 chains yes

[26-Jun-18 03:16 AM] Mylo#8306
so what's that up to 8000 chains?  150r 150w ...

[26-Jun-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
without a time to live... it was  very expensive to read it

[26-Jun-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing

[26-Jun-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
256r/w

[26-Jun-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think i calculated

[26-Jun-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like $5 for a single day or something silly.

[26-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah, 128*64=8192 chains.   128*2w&2r=256r/w

[26-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Mylo#8306
theree's a `*`

[26-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Mylo#8306
in there somewhere

[26-Jun-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah discord fucks up math

[26-Jun-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have to use x

[26-Jun-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe this works `128*64`

[26-Jun-18 03:18 AM] Mylo#8306
what was TTL, just a timestamp in the future?

[26-Jun-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah thers an attribute called TTL, you just set that to a coloum in the DB then push a time stamp to it.
ttl=$(date -d '+4 minutes' +%s)

[26-Jun-18 03:18 AM] Mylo#8306
good mechanism, leave it to the front end to filter out

[26-Jun-18 03:19 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm looking forward to the next scaletest.  any ideas when it is?  aws-ec2 is the blocker atm, and kubernetes yet to test?

[26-Jun-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep, just used dynamoDB to handle aggregation of data... it could scale out to hundreds of thousands of chains I think, but you would need to move more code to a lambda function at that scale, rather than on smks VPS.,

[26-Jun-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I need kubernetes for 256 chains. so we cna make sure stats site wont break under load... 64 chains was 5-1-% CPU on a 2 core VPS

[26-Jun-18 03:20 AM] Mylo#8306
i think dynamo has a streaming function, so at that scale, probably comes into play.

[26-Jun-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I treid to use it... usless

[26-Jun-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all I could get it to do was push to a log

[26-Jun-18 03:21 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - i haven't used it - just read that it was a feature.

[26-Jun-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I no nothing of node.js

[26-Jun-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think smk's code could be ported to it

[26-Jun-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for infinite scale
