[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Main issues were converting the back ned from using sockets from explorers to using a JSON input and then smoothing the data so it didnt jump up and down like a rollercoaster.

[26-Jun-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: can we keep the data in DynamoDB longer than 4 minutes? My concern is if there is problem with stats server and it cannot pull the data, we loose data in DynamoDB.

[26-Jun-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> No keeping it there longer than even 5minutes creates ridiculous scan times... we will overload it and slow it down so much it will fail. There is an option to back up the data before it expires, but I was unable to figure out how to make it work.

[26-Jun-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Each chain saves its own stats into the .komodo folder inside the shared volume. if Live data feed goes down we can run analysis on this after the fact.

[26-Jun-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: ok

[26-Jun-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> however simply testing a few multiples of 64 chain clusters and electroplating the trend will tell us everything we need to know for this... we can always have 2 satats servers a backup, it will just require 2x the amount of DB reads...

[26-Jun-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> smk will be finished work in a few more hours and he can explain better the design, its quite modular and works in stages.

[26-Jun-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> sure, btw. everyone should document his part and put it next to his GH repo. I am documenting Kubernetes part. Will create also detailed AWS diagram when I have more time.

[26-Jun-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> nice, I have commented and documented everything on my end aswell. It would be best to have others review it for accuracy before we run a very large test. From simply working out expected TX/s for full blocks at 1 block per minute, it looks like the data its spitting out is exactly correct, but better safe than sorry.

[26-Jun-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Maybe I should get dwy's script and run that on 64 chains after a test and compare its output to the data smk's site generates aswell.

[26-Jun-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> that script was 100% accurate from all accounts in last test.

[26-Jun-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: yeah it is good idea.

[26-Jun-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> ok cool. I will do that tonight then, will speak to both guys and make it happen.

[26-Jun-18 08:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
blackjoker's explanation of my end is a good summary., happy to answer any Qs

[26-Jun-18 08:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I added something to store the raw incoming data yesterday. Didn't intend to keep it running for the big show, but thought it a good idea to doa review of aggregate values vs raw data after the next blast.

[26-Jun-18 08:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can have a look at replication for dynamo at some stage if it helps, but got a few projects on at the moment so probably not this week

[26-Jun-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats ok. All I need to do is run one last blast and get you to save the data, I will also save the blockchains and run the stats by dwy and webworker from last test over it, to verify it.

[slack] <Ben from Komodo> can someone give me proof for 45K transaction speed please?

[26-Jun-18 03:15 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
most convincing proof is in the blocks of the asset chains

[26-Jun-18 03:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got a short gif of test a couple of days ago at https://i.imgur.com/yQMRaZh.gif

There is a test live right now

[26-Jun-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am pretty sure the data is correct. We had a few issue debugging. We will run dwy/webworkers stats from the first ScaleTest over this data at the end to verify it.

no targets, just testing, reviewing, tweaking

[26-Jun-18 04:28 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
few changes in last 48hrs, checking to see how theyre working

[26-Jun-18 04:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to verify data... without kubernetes and an AWS account that isnt blocked we cannot scale very far.

[26-Jun-18 04:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If I get back from my week off and we still have no AWS account...

[26-Jun-18 05:39 PM] Steve Lee#1967
what exactly is the AWS issue?

[26-Jun-18 05:39 PM] Steve Lee#1967
is it  being blocked in the root account or a connected account?

[26-Jun-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> n2okpride: creation of EC2 instances in the account is blocked. I think it does not matter if root or IAM user account is used.

[26-Jun-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <n2okpride:matrix.org> ok

[26-Jun-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jun-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> n2okpride: blackjok3r was sending email to support already. I think he got email address of support guys from you. But if you can escalate it, it would be great.

[26-Jun-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Hopefully we can get a test with dockerswarm or kubernetes tomorrow. I have given webworker01 a copy of both data sets to compare our results to see if its a bug in the stats website or the miner.

scaling site got some small issues

[27-Jun-18 02:49 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
BTW can we have access to historical test records? either youtube movies of this site or just possibility to upload and play last tests ...

[27-Jun-18 02:49 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so that even if nothing happens could be possible to view test from 25 June or other dates

[27-Jun-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... most of it so far was debugging... smk found the bug in the website tonight using the SQL dump.

[27-Jun-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I go on holidays tomorrow for about a week. When I come back we will get back into this, and hopefully finally have a working AWS account.

[27-Jun-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the test will be able to be replayed at will on the site in the future, but its pointless doing those things until its working 100%

[27-Jun-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The 10,000TX 50,000 payments test, was expected data, but we no longer have it apart from the gif.

[27-Jun-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
webworker01 should have a webiste or something with last nights test results, for public viewing in the next few days.

[27-Jun-18 03:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll be restoring older data over the next few days - need to filter out what doesnt match the source blocks during testing. Also got a copy of the block source for last night which will be used to repopulate the db
Tweaking a few things with random data at the moment.

[27-Jun-18 03:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I 'm pretty sure I have the 10k tx / 50k pt data in a backup

How can I get the "genesisblock" value of a chain to put in the m_notary script?

Hey guys, I was contacted by a Komodo ambassador on Linkedin. Who's the best person to talk to about writing for your platform? I was invited to join this channel.

[28-Jun-18 01:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
marketing, maybe?

[28-Jun-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
huh?

[28-Jun-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Everything you need is in the TXSCLxxx_COIN file generated by komodod when you start it.

[28-Jun-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[28-Jun-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That repo contains scripts to automatically generate a m_notary_scale file for unlimited amount of chains... although I doubt you can notarize much more than 128 at once.

[28-Jun-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was also a WIP and once it worked I stopped working on it.

[28-Jun-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also genisis block, is the the same as KMD for all AC if you specifically need that for some reason.

[28-Jun-18 01:46 AM] Alright#0419
heh, didn't realize they were all exactly the same value

[28-Jun-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am pretty sure they are.

[28-Jun-18 01:47 AM] Alright#0419
yup

[28-Jun-18 02:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
8 chains per user - put logic in NN - run the world - add more random NNs to suport the data - P2P block chain everything,,, tell me if I'm wrong

[28-Jun-18 02:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
So maybe 4x4 or 2x2 per user - with 64 Zeus nodes running it all

[28-Jun-18 02:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Go big or go home

[28-Jun-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181

After comparing source data from the asset chain blocks to the data the vis aggreagted, I can confirm it was under reporting on the front end during the last test on tuesday. 
Found the bug I suspect that caused it, and made a fix (yet to push to git tho).
I got random stats active on the vis this morning without being tooo late for the day job.  Left it running for about 10 hours, and it seems to be reporting true. 
Will continue to to monitor and tweak until black3joker gets back, and once we switch back from random to real hopefully it will stay that way. 
Noticed my PC at work still failing to load graph due to CORS error despite accessing data on same domain, but added headers to nginx which fixed that over lunch.

Thinking about how to add a simple validation process to be run alongside the main stream to identify issues  (and thier origin) in real time rather than make joker and me lose sleep trying to figure out wtf is going on when it doesnt look right.

Other updates pending (in order of priority) 
-Extra links to more detailed info about the testing (send me links if you have something) - done
-Restoring validated data from previous test runs into graph history
-Aesthitic tweaks after feedback from marketing - ongoing
-"all time high" tx / pt text (or graph labels)
-video capture of live graph and/or a replay button between user input timeframes
-A review of the 'effects' and metric being used front end

Potential extras down the track
-Something to keep the audience entertained while the timer counts down to the next blast.
-Subtle audio indicator to communicate imminent live blast
-ITTT to push out social media alerts prior to blasts to get more eyes on.
