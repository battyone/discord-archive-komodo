I would assume through 64 different explorers.

[17-Nov-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[17-Nov-18 03:43 PM] Regnar#6164
My concern is for an individual user who doesn't really know/care/understand they are separate chains, but sees it all as just KMD. What does that mean for someone checking an explorer for their txid if there are 64 explorers, how do they know which chain they are on?

[17-Nov-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem we would need to have some enhancements to agama to display the specific chain

[17-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Regnar#6164
Even then though, other wallets would have to do the same, wouldn't it be simpler to enhance the explorer itself, so all wallets that use them would be immediately on the same page?

[17-Nov-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
explorers are separate from wallets

[17-Nov-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
likely we would need to enhance both

[17-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Regnar#6164
I understand, I'm thinking of lite wallets and how they would know which chain they're on, which explorer to check etc. I assume exchanges are running their own nodes (at least I'd hope) but that is another thing, does multiple explorers affect how exchanges spot/verify incoming deposits?

[17-Nov-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking there should be just one coin of the cluster that is used for external things, like exchanges

[17-Nov-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so you use the single main explorer for exchange usage

[17-Nov-18 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
basically there is another coordinate added to txid, the chain id

[17-Nov-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
this directly indicates the type of GUI/explorer things that are needed

[17-Nov-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the stats aggregation site can also provide some sort of txid lookup

[17-Nov-18 03:51 PM] Regnar#6164
yea that extra coordinate would make sense. So if I'm using a lite wallet on X chain and exchanges are using Y chain, I assume when I send to the exchange it performs the burn protocol to swap chains, but the exchange doesn't need to view X, just Y for the confirmations?

[17-Nov-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the exchange shouldnt have to know about any other than the chain0 of the cluster

[17-Nov-18 03:52 PM] Regnar#6164
right

[17-Nov-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that way there is no extra work needed and we know they dont like to do extra work

[17-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay so then any wallet viewing any chain shouldn't have to worry about any other chain because the burn protocol swaps the coin to their chain anyway.

[17-Nov-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
well. that would mean the chain id needs to be added to a user address, so there is no escaping the chainid for cross cluster transacting

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] Regnar#6164
So does that mean each chain has identical addresses, and then needs the chainid to clarify which address on which chain a transaction is going to?

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] Regnar#6164
or unique addresses, lol

[17-Nov-18 04:01 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm thinking they are unique. An address (123) on chain X, doesn't exist on chain Y, otherwise I wouldn't need to burn coins on chain Y when sending to 123.

[17-Nov-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
one privkey for all chains, the same address

[17-Nov-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but they are different chains

[17-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Regnar#6164
haha definitely a learning curve

[17-Nov-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
until the coins are transferred to the other chain, they arent in the other chain

[17-Nov-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
just think about how it would work if the chains are independent chains

[17-Nov-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
since they are independent chains

[17-Nov-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
with independent blocks, independent tx,

[17-Nov-18 04:03 PM] Regnar#6164
but the same addresses

[17-Nov-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and address doesnt actually exist in the real blockchain

[17-Nov-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
just scriptPubKey vout that can be spent by specific privkeys, whose pubkeys encode into addresses

{Reactions}
üëç 

[17-Nov-18 04:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Owner of address 123 would own 123 on all chains, but if they are an exchange and only looking at chain X (their balance syncs up with the other chains) but for someone sending coins to the exchange from chain Y, they would convert their coins to the X chain? or simply send to 123 on Y?

[17-Nov-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
exchange looks at chain0 (lets use that instead of X. Y)

{Reactions}
üëå (2) 

[17-Nov-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that means you need to send coins on chain0 for the coins to be sent on chain0

[17-Nov-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you send coins on LTC, do they appear in BTC?

[17-Nov-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
dont try to imagine any new magics

[17-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Regnar#6164
but LTC and BTC aren't syncing with each other

[17-Nov-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
neither are these chains

[17-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Regnar#6164
okay

[17-Nov-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
they are not syncing to each other

[17-Nov-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
how can they? they are indpendent chains

[17-Nov-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
they are able to burn coins on one chain and have them recreated on another. like the transporter in star trek

[17-Nov-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so there are all these different chains, each with their own coins, blocks, current blockhash. one of the tx you can do is transport coins to any other chain

[17-Nov-18 04:16 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay. So there's chain0 and then chain1 spawns up, it is an independent chain (blocks, hash etc) that can have KMD sent to it (via burning it from chain0) and can send KMD from it to chain0 (by burning it from chain1) the same coin can only exist on chain1 or chain0.

[17-Nov-18 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the total coins across the entire cluster is kept constant

{Reactions}
üëå 

[17-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Regnar#6164
But the same address *could* exist on both chain0 and chain1, by using the same keys. But because they are independent chains when chain1 spawns up it doesn't include all the information from chain0 (like a fork)

[17-Nov-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt include ANY information from chain0

[17-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Regnar#6164
right

[17-Nov-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an independent chain

[17-Nov-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
dont forget independent chains are independent

[17-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Regnar#6164
except that it is KMD and how to do the basic underlying protocols

[17-Nov-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the only "magic" is that coins can be sent from one chain to the other

[17-Nov-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
there is KMD and there is komodod

[17-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Regnar#6164
Can you elaborate on that? (I'm likely going to post this as a reddit scaling discussion)

[17-Nov-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD instance of komodod is needed to be able to create the burn protocol coin transfers

[17-Nov-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
komodod is the single executable that can run thousands of different chains, without any code changes

[17-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay got it.

[17-Nov-18 04:37 PM] Regnar#6164
So a clarifying point. An address on chain0 wants to send to chain1 (two independent but fungible chains) it would burn chain0 coins to send to chain1, but it seems a chain designation for each transaction might be necessary

[17-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Regnar#6164
For example, assuming cross chain takes longer than a transaction on a single chain, someone could use the same keys on each chain to make duplicate addresses on each chain to avoid users having to burn when they want to send to funds (for example a high volume retailer wants quicker transactions). That retailer would then have multiple duplicate addresses on different chains (using same keys) and if they wanted to consolidate it for whatever reason on the same chain same address, the transaction from chain0 to chain1 would need the chain designation in it otherwise it would just send transactions to itself on it's own chain.

[17-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Regnar#6164
Though it seems like they could just use a new address (on one chain) to send all the duplicate address balances to, it still seems to indicate a chain designation is needed in a transaction?

[17-Nov-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
are you confusing utxo system that KMD chains are, with a balance based system?

[17-Nov-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
just because there is balance at an address on one chain, it needs to be having the same utxo to be able to do what you talk about. but there is nothing in common between the INDEPENDENT chains, so the utxo are not compatible

[17-Nov-18 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
each chain needs to be used as a chain, ie. properly signed transactions

[17-Nov-18 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
I think you are trying to make it have some extra magical properties that it doesnt

[17-Nov-18 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
they are simply independent chains

[17-Nov-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
that happen to be able to implement a burn/recreate protocol between them

[17-Nov-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
everything works as normal, other than the burn protocol

[17-Nov-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing else is differnt

[17-Nov-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing else is magical

[17-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea no magic. I'm thinking as a business would. If my customers are on multiple different chains and I want to accept their payments, my options are they burn their coins from their chains when sending to the chain I'm on (which I'm assuming is slower than same chain transactions, correct me if I'm wrong about this), or if I need faster times, I treat each chain as the independent chain they are, and create an address on each chain, simplest way is to use the same keys to make the same address I have posted at my shop. 

Now I have the same address on multiple different independent chains, and need to pay my employees or buy things, if I have my sales spread out on different chains and need to make a single payment that requires me to combine them, for example sending to an employee, supplier, etc who is only on one chain. Is the method I use to do this burning the coins from the multiple chains to get it to the address that's only on one chain? 

I'm not sure if that clarifies what I'm asking?

[17-Nov-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just accept funds on any chain, using same address

[17-Nov-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the chainid is needed to quickly find incoming payments

[17-Nov-18 05:23 PM] Regnar#6164
and then use the burn to combine as needed?

[17-Nov-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[17-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay, that's all I was asking about consolidating to a single chain. Needs the chainid.

[17-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay thanks for the info!

[18-Nov-18 05:04 AM] CrisF#3405
@Regnar We have been testing coin migrations between chains in the KMDLabs test cluster #kmdlabs.
You are  welcome to find out more about it there.  You can even give it a try if you'd like.
We will be shutting down the test cluster shortly as we will be moving from testing to the live KMDLabs cluster.

[18-Nov-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might keep a test cluster... Likely run it on main net notaries... Just two chains likely, good to have testnet to test with

if you need more info that that, I can try and explain it

[24-Nov-18 05:13 AM] nuttycoin#5982
i am familiar with komodos approach in that chains can run independently, but the only reason it would make sense is because there is a burn protocol that jl777 mentioned above. i am curious about how that works

[24-Nov-18 05:13 AM] nuttycoin#5982
specifically this line:

[24-Nov-18 05:13 AM] nuttycoin#5982
It makes extensive use of Merkle Trees to notarize transactions that take place on one chain onto every other chain in the Komodo ecosystem.

[24-Nov-18 05:14 AM] nuttycoin#5982
i know what merkle trees are but i am curious as to how they can enable bob to verify that alice has enough funds to pay him, without bob keeping track of any of alice's actions previously

[24-Nov-18 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its actaully quite simple, at least in my understadngin of it ...

[24-Nov-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every 10 blocks, a merklet root is taked of each blocks merklet root

[24-Nov-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarised to KMD in an OP_RETURN

[24-Nov-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thenKMD tracks all these, and takes a Merkle root, of all the merkle roots

[24-Nov-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then that merkleroot is notarised back to each assetchain

[24-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using an SPV proof you can chekc if a TX is valid against any of these merkelroots to verify it happened.

[24-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then to burnr coins, you just burn the,m

[24-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and waiut until the valid merkle root is on the input chain (taks a whiel 15-20misn usually, someitmes much longer os chain stalls or something)

[24-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then when that chain can prove the burn on another chain happened.

[24-Nov-18 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it lets you create the coins in that chain as a "coinbase" but, its an import, rathe than a coinabse but hey look much the same.

[24-Nov-18 05:42 AM] nuttycoin#5982
so if i understand correctly, the input chain looks to the KMD main chain for a merkle root to validate that the address in the output chain had enough funds?
