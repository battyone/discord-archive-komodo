all good nearly 2am, and I am still on explorers, although with a quick mod to deckers repo, that was trivial shit. Whole process was pretty easy, apart from a broken set of chain params at the start.

[30-Aug-18 05:46 PM] libscott#8867
@Alright do you remember theres that bit you cant do with just the cli

[30-Aug-18 05:46 PM] libscott#8867
because fundrawtransaction moves the opreturn to position 1

[30-Aug-18 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
yea, found the date we talk about it

[30-Aug-18 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
just have to scroll up a month

[30-Aug-18 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r you going to hook it up with some STAKED notaries when we go dual chain? üòõ

[30-Aug-18 05:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats the plan.

[30-Aug-18 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although a 8192 chain cluster is a bit big for STAKED üòõ

[30-Aug-18 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but this was easy as pie... we need to get JL to change some stuff I think for STAKED to work though. I think TXSCL is a special con in komodod/iguana

[30-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
```

    Create a raw transaction
    Fund it with fundrawtransaction
    migrate_converttoexport
    broadcast with sendrawtransaction
    migrate_createimporttransaction on source chain
    migrate_completeimporttransaction on KMD
    broadcast on target chain

Encrypted by an unverified device

    Create a raw transaction
    Fund it with fundrawtransaction
    migrate_converttoexport
    Sign
    broadcast with sendrawtransaction
    migrate_createimporttransaction on source chain
    migrate_completeimporttransaction on KMD
    broadcast on target chain
```

[30-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
that's the full process, but with hoek it's really simple

just missing one bit

looks quite simple. I saved that

I used that repo, its a mofified version of Deckers, but I have no idea how NGINX works.... there is a script called `helper.sh` that seems like it does something.

[31-Aug-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can just start up the expolorer instnace and give you the login if you like, or you can help me to do it.

I litterally just killed everything, but Its all setup to reset chains and restart withing 10-15 mins...

[31-Aug-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just testing somethign with the largest AWS instance you can get, so will smash that out, then we can do the explorers I think, this insatnace cant be cheap.

@blackjok3r are the TXSCL chains live and being notarizing? Could I do some testing on them?

[01-Sep-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no I took them down, its expensive to keep up the instances for 64 of them.

[02-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Mylo#8306
how big is the instance for 64 chains?

[02-Sep-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
96 vCPU for blasting, the CPU limiter was causing issues so I just used a bigger instance

[02-Sep-18 03:33 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks.   for giggles, say i hired a xeon 5120 by the hour.  and used the current scripts to make 16 or 32 chains.  how long would that take to get up and running?

[02-Sep-18 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181

buying asic from a monopolist has nothing to do with true decentralised crypto

[03-Sep-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bitmain is not a monopoly... There are innosillicon ASIC for equihash as well, which are heaps more powerful than Z9 mini.

[03-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Amel#1960
@blackjok3r @jl777c 

z9 miner of innosillicon ist sold out. the minimal amount order was very high. not aiming for small private miners.

ok we have three vendors for equihash asic miner.



Innosillicon - sold out. minimal buyorder very high buyprice very high (ripoff)

Asicminer.co ASICminer Zeon a big fat piece of garbage for 20k! LOL (ripoff)

Bittmain Z9 and Z9 Mini. What i have to say about bitmain?! now you have to make KYC to buy hardware LOL!


everyone can go in a store and buy a gpu and be part of the network. i think you guys need the big amout of hashes. or payed by these companys.

nowadays decentralised is not important anymore. hope you guys didnt get burned by a 51% attack by these nice asics machines.

good luck

[04-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Remember about four years ago the new thing (pump) was to be ASIC resistant? There would be about five new mining algo's released every week. Most of it went no where and the ASIC coins are the ones to still be around today.

[04-Sep-18 02:33 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
During that ASIC resistant movement a group of scammers realized they can profit from it. You had coins being released claiming ASIC resistant which can only be mined using their software. That software was a trojan to steal coins or key log your sign in info with coinbase. One of the "mining software" even embedded itself into the users router.

[06-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Mylo#8306
Main net for your own blockchain already exists.  We just need to document it so there‚Äôs a turnkey solution for business.  Also we need to test it more to see how much further it goes and how many resources it takes.
Main net for KMD coin is still ~120 tx/s.  No need to increase throughput yet.  But for dapps built on kmd tech, it‚Äôs independent.  Your dapp my dapp anyone‚Äôs dapp- all independent so they can each run many tx/s

[09-Sep-18 12:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
bridged the gap between history and live, running a few more tests to confirm it doesn't matter how long after history file is wriiten when you load - should look the same. Appears to be seamless with local generated random block

maybe #private-staked channel.  otherwise, install kmd from src and the early reference contracts are included (dev branch of jl777 repo probably has more recent testing) and if you have docker, checkout hub.docker / imylomylo there's a docker image there from 2 weeks ago, i'll update that this week with new CCs (like oracles)

[11-Sep-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of, there are some loose ends to tie up, but I have been horribly side tracked on STAKED getting the actual cross chain transfers working properly... its one thing to do 1 million TX/s (actually not that hard) but to make all the chains "talk" to each other is a lot harder.

[11-Sep-18 10:36 AM] sœÜldat#8733
Ok and white block company confirm this future announcement of 1M tx/s ?

[11-Sep-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had an email about a meeting with them but I was not contacted again about it. @Steve Lee was the person talking to them. I think the cross chain transfers we are woking on with STAKED project will be more important for that than the pure TX/s
