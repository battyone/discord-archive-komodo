lets look into the one global shared case of simple payments, lets say a national currency to handle all transactions by everyone. I can see creating chains based on geography, regions, cities, towns, where there is a lot of cache effects. Also to create currencies by type of usage, ie. around product types.

[27-May-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
in such a case, we can envision thousands of chains for the entire economy, but a single user would only care about a handful. in the event he will be traveling, he would convert to the blockchains in the region he is going. This is similar to converting your fiat into different fiat when you travel.

[27-May-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
by allowing users to migrate their coins to the chains they use, it automatically creates the caching effect. I highly doubt you can design an allocation of chains ahead of time (as nobody can predict things as complex as economies), so just spawn more chains if there are not enough in certain areas

[27-May-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
independent chains are like building more roads if the traffic congestion is too bad

[27-May-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
sharding is making some magical road that all cars can use, with near infinite capacity

[27-May-19 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
our approach is proven and requires no magical tech, the sharding requires tech from the future, just we dont know how far in the future yet

Hey @Ian haven't been keeping up on development of RES, are you guys considering using this scaling tech?

[28-May-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
how is the project going in general?

[29-May-19 07:45 AM] Ian#3705
@Alright I am not part of the team, just part of the community. The team are pushing towards going live in early July and it will not be using any scaling features other than on the main chain to start with - and i agree with that - you need to walk before you can run. Unfortunately, because i am not part of the team, i don't have access to ongoing development plans until they roll out the development plan for community involvement so i don't know what/if scalability features they plan.

I am just looking for my own inerest at the moment although it might be possible that i have more influence as the community gets involved. The main chain is involved in some on the Instant Swap tech so it might become an issue in the future but am sure that it is "fast enough" for the launch - i just think there should be plans for scalability and it is difficult to hard partition as Komodo are planning

[29-May-19 07:47 AM] Alright#0419
that instant swap thing they're talking about seems to be our "0conf" feature from barterdex repurposed to use their MN network

[29-May-19 07:47 AM] Alright#0419
pretty clever

[29-May-19 08:19 AM] Ian#3705
Scaled Layer 1 (sharding, multichains) could work but Layer 2 also - more complex as would have to setup a network of suitably funded nodes but might also be able to add Lightning/future Liquid support which would be interesting (Liquid a bit ahead i think) Am not entirely sure on pros/cons of a custom Layer 2 or public Lightning/BOLT - its not yet clear enough without access to the real thing which i don't yet

[29-May-19 08:51 AM] Alright#0419
@Ian we have a payments channels CC, might be another interesting chat to have with jl üòõ

[29-May-19 08:53 AM] Alright#0419
ask him his opinions on LN while you're at it ü§£

[29-May-19 09:01 AM] Ian#3705
Yeah i realise payments channels don't come without a lot of complexity and limitations

Hi there, I have an Issue: Yesterday I sent my KMD from my Adress RVDrnL99KQFNcCuM2FLDnjUvwUpUgYGcPA to get the reward. Now my balance is 0. I checked my balance also on the dexstats.info and my KMD storage is 0.

[05-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Matthias#8937
How can I secure my funds (send them out of my Agama wallet if the balance is 0 and where are my coins

[05-Jun-19 01:52 PM] gcharang#6833

[05-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Matthias#8937
ok. great. Thx for your support!

[05-Jun-19 02:21 PM] istante#3749
my komodo is in your wallet RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF ... and now ? how claim it ?

[05-Jun-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.

Can i give you as new wallet  (3^question)  a ledger wallet or bittrex wallet ?

[05-Jun-19 02:44 PM] gcharang#6833
if you have a ledger wallet, that is better
make sure the ledger seed/privkeys weren't used in agama previously @istante

[05-Jun-19 04:22 PM] javita#1621
Was going to send to Bittrex, but it says temporarily off line. If our funds are still in the wallet, can we send directly out of the Agama wallet, or are there steps and precautions we have to take?

Hello.  I have some feed back on the mobile DEX.  Very good so far.  I have done 11 swaps.  6 Timeout failures.  For some reason, the tactile feedback on entering my pin could be more sensitive.  For the 6 number password, it often only registers 5 numbers. Not sure why, but it happens more often than not.  Also, when a atomic swap fails, it would be better to have the error message stay up until you confirm OK.  Many times I am trying to read the error message but it dissapears before I finish reading it.  Overall, the mobile DEX is impressive and I am excited for Komodo's future.  Keep up the great work. üëå
