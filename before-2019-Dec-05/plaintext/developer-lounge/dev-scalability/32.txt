not execs or business leaders, these are more like an account rep

[23-Oct-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and based on this zilliqa is gained such "adoption"?

i'm looking

[23-Oct-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, seems it is worth at least a press release?

[23-Oct-18 05:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967
PR yes, now that we're approved we can ask for some joint marketing

[23-Oct-18 05:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967

[23-Oct-18 05:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
make the press release about the upcoming scaling test and mention it there
don't want it to be perceived like the overplayed Azure nonsense that has tired people 
IMO

[23-Oct-18 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess having AWS do the press release would be much more impactful

[23-Oct-18 05:47 PM] Steve Lee#1967
yes, we could just announce approval, then use the scaling test for the joint release

[23-Oct-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
and if we are really the first, maybe it can be clarified without saying bad things about the other projects

[23-Oct-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but explaining the "free" level, the easy level and our level

[23-Oct-18 05:50 PM] Steve Lee#1967
yes definitely

Oh I've prepared to some AWS certification recently. Will partnership means some discounts on certifications? üòÉ

I think so yes ... they are are always sending me emails for free courses, but htey are all in the USA, and it doubtful id get into that country üòÇ

[24-Oct-18 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
First results back from new MoMoM test ... 
using freq=5 chain to migrate to freq=15 chains is producing results with 0 fails after 24H of sending 1 migrate TX every 120s.

Using 2 chains in their own cluster with freq=15 on both, transfering 1 TX each 120s there is also 0 failed migrate TXs. These chains are both sending back and fourth to each other 1 coin each 120s. 

I will leave this test running for a few more days, to make sure, but this seems to confirm @jl777c's theory that MoMoM issues are due to too fast notarisation frequecny. This has implications, but if this makes it work, we will next try a freq of 10, as this is the default for KMD chains. Also we need to try and see how many chains can be added to a cluster before the issue appears. My guess is that it probably wont, cause any issues adding more chains,as it seems to be an issue with the freq on the receiving chain only.

it could be a small chance to happen

[24-Oct-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and the more total notarizations, the more likely it is to happen

[24-Oct-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That too... which is why I am leaving it to run for many days

is it true that whiteblock.io won't do the third party validation?

They want to charge $xxK, we don't want to pay $xxK for the service at this stage until we've done the test.

[06-Nov-18 05:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

@cammofunk you can have some information here. Not sure to understand, but as far as i know, they are ready, they are just waiting on marketing and stuff like that.

[07-Nov-18 09:43 PM] BlockTech#6895
No exact date for now. could be weeks, or months i guess.

@KomodoWorld No cheaper pay-as-you-go options were disclosed when we spoke. The quote received was way higher than anticipated. Coming from the enterprise technology industry, I place high value on 3rd party testing, however at this time we couldn't justify the cost.

[08-Nov-18 07:05 AM] JohnnyNgo#5874

Question about scalability and block explorers. Are current block explorers set up to show scaling chains and their transactions along side one another?

[17-Nov-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
would need an explorer for each chain

[17-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Regnar#6164
Thanks jl777. I'm not too familiar about how the explorers work exactly, but is it possible to design the block explorers to group blocks from multiple chains as a single "block" and just have field to indicate which chain the transaction happened on?

[17-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Regnar#6164
It seems like a custom solution imo

[17-Nov-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
since the blocks are synchronized, it would be an arbitrary grouping

[17-Nov-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but anything is possible if you can make custom explorer

[17-Nov-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically aggregating all the chains into a single dataset would require incredible amounts of bandwidth

[17-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Regnar#6164
So in example, the explorers are synced, but as a regular user, could you not see your transaction information on an explorer itself?

[17-Nov-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you could look up your txid in the corresponding explorer, as normal

[17-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Regnar#6164
corresponding, as in N chain specific explorer?

[17-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Regnar#6164
or any old explorer.

[17-Nov-18 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
as in you would know which specific chain the txid is for and you would use that chains explorer

[17-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm wondering if there's a way to aggregate the chains, even delayed or after blocks have been confirmed, in order to show results of total transactions among all chains for N block. Or if there is a way to make checking txid not reliant on knowing which chain/explorer to check. I could see that being a problem with 2 chains and even more so with 64 or more. What is our current method for providing proof of scaling capabilities?

[17-Nov-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
they are independent blockchains

[17-Nov-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
how would you prove that 64 blockchains exist and did the transactions they did?
