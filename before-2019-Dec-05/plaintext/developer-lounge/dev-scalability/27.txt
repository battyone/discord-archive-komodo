@patchkez  Giving up on this... AWS does not report the correct IP address for public access inside iteself. So ceph-ansible is not working, nothing can communicate. 
I will put off my other work that I had lined up for tomorrow another day and try to start again using GlusterFS, as I have found more up to date docs for that and hopefully wont have to keep going in circles.

[08-Aug-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ceph looks great for deploying on physical servers, but on AWS its just not playing ball.

[08-Aug-18 12:50 PM] patchkez#5349
@blackjok3r ok, thanks for update.  I still need to investigate if we can use any combination of AWS services instead of building dedicated shared storage.

[08-Aug-18 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesn't look like we can, unless we have a heap of separate EBS volumes and then copy all th data to one place aftrerwards, to me this seems like far too much effort to set up. I would rather deploy a shared volume and just push all data directly to that, it has to be easier in the long run. If I knew what I was doing today, I would have realised what I was doing wasn't goig to work, earlier on, but meh. Another day of learning more stuff.

```The maximum throughput you can drive for each Amazon EC2 instance is 250 MB/s.
Up to 128 active user accounts for each instance can have files open at the same time. Each user account represents one local user logged in to the instance.
Up to 32,768 files open at the same time on the instance.```
According to these, if each EC2 instance, is a cluster of 64 chains, we are well inside all limits. 
If we need to spread over the 2 regions with Kubernetes available, we might need to have 2 EFS in total each with 4096 chains. then sync these together after the test. Using this all the Containers can use the same data store, as they already place their stuff in their own folder, we wont get any issues. I can even mount it as the Data Store for the first 64 chains.

[09-Aug-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have created a new Kubernetes cluster on AWS with EFS connected to it. This should do it for the last of the issues, unless Patchkez runs into some more. 
@Steve Lee  is there any news on AWS, and our funding and account limits being raised enough to run a large scale test?

[09-Aug-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will hopefully be able to run a smaller scale test over the weekend to make sure everything works as epxected.

@Steve Lee  Sorry my internet has been down all week, I just rang them to complain and its working for now, I ran out of data on mobile, and they wont refund it , because its on a different company. 
I will get an estimate of funding later today, tbh its not a huge amount (less than $2000 I think), the larger problem is using so many instances for only such a small time and if they will actually let us do that.

No worries mate. There is only first test explorers on one machine. @jl777c do you want to keep those? It was close to 1tb of data for block chains and explorers, in the .komodo folder.

[13-Aug-18 12:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you want I can download whatever TB of data to my offline machine. I'd never ever want to lose our precious test data.

[13-Aug-18 12:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ns408 can probably find even better solution to keep it always accessible on online cloud storage.

[13-Aug-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its all on the 88.x server. I rsynced it from all the other servers to it, then loaded the exploreres up but I dont think anyone ever has used it. If you can sort that out it would be good, as I have other things I need to get done. üòÉ

hey guys, we are not sleeping! here is short update to those reading this channel.  We were working with @blackjok3r  during weekend on AWS Kubernetes cluster. I managed to create POD which contains 2 containers - assetchain container and miner container. This test suppose to give us working K8N definition yaml file, which we can now templatize in order to create X chains. @blackjok3r  was trying to setup EFS provisioner which allows us to mount EFS storage as a persistent volume into Kubernetes cluster. The idea is that every POD/container will have EFS volume attached and blockchain data will be stored there. These data can be used as a proof after the scaling test is finished. We had some troubles with EFS, it could not create PV/PVC. @blackjok3r  I managed to fix it, it was issue with RBAC which was needed to be setup for our cluster. I can now mount EFS volume to both containers and write data there. Next step is to create more PODs (3?) to test they are writing its blockchain to correct place. In the meantime I am going to create script for  generating Kubernetes definition yaml files for all chains participating in scaling test.

@blackjok3r @patchkez I have a call scheduled tomorrow with AWS. Please let me know what additional funding is needed, along with any other asks. Thanks in advance.

[13-Aug-18 11:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool I can do this hopefully today I guess just wildly over estimating unknown costs should work just fine, most aws stuff is quite cheap over short time periods.

[14-Aug-18 12:11 AM] Steve Lee#1967
thanks. a  ball park range should be fine.

[14-Aug-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
EC2 instances: 
128 x m4.x16large : $409.60 per hour
Test goes for approx 2H, but it is unknown how long it takes to start all containers at this stage.
I think its safe to bank on a 6-8H peroid, but it will hopefully be much less than this.
We will have a better idea once we run the 256 chain test on EKS.
Maximum: $3280

DynamoDB:
150 Writes / 1500 Reads: Approx $23 per 24/h 

Lambda + API's: For our application this is free or under $1 for entire test and all testing so far.

EKS: 20c per hour for cluster, all chains should run in a single cluster, unless we need to split over 2 regions.
Most of the cost here will be running this cluster in the weeks leading up to the test, although once it is working we can destroy it and redeploy at a later date to save money.
2 regions for an entire week is: $135

EFS: $102 per day with 10TB of data. It would be silly to leave the data on here long term, we would move it to a dedicated HDD server to save vast sums of money, after the test is run.
I guess bank on $400 here as a total maximum, depending on how long it takes to transfer 7-10TB of data to a permenant server, and also data bandwidth could be a factor to move out of AWS if we do that.
-----------------------------
Maximum worst case cost of AWS: $3839 ‚Äì I think there is still $2000 credit on the account, but we will use up some of this in the final tests and the 256 chain test.

[14-Aug-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notarization Servers:
We need 4 servers for notarization, I would prefer to host them outside of AWS as proof the chains work over long distances and the internet in general, not just in a closed AWS environment. 
Maybe some cheap hetzner servers, or something we already have access too. I ran this on four 4 Core 16GB VPS's on my first try months ago, but they were a little small. 
Four of 6 core 32Gb will be the minimum requred here, either VPS or dedicated server from any provider with good network speed.
I would also like these up at least 2 days in advance and possibly a server with explorers for the first 64 chains only so people can inspect the notarization TX's.
Need some clarification on this part of it, I.e do we need/want explorers, which hosting do we use etc?

@Steve Lee  @jl777c

[14-Aug-18 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
people will want proof that we actually did the million tx/sec

[14-Aug-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
noashh might have some hertzner servers, there is also satinder's hertzners if we need those, he needs to keep them alive a bit longer

[14-Aug-18 07:46 AM] Mylo#8306
hetzner also has a "storage box" service for hosting 10TB data which might be useful for independent verification as the servers would only have 1-2TB and have 5TB data transfer.   data tx is limited to 20TB though - this may be a more cost effective method of holding data for a month or two?

[14-Aug-18 07:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[14-Aug-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK cool.
For the notarization I think the 3 servers Satinder already has will be absolutly fine, there is no need to use 4, thats just the number I chose to use in my first test, 3 is enough with freq.2 to make sure MoMoM is being notarized over 64 chains. So that covers that.

The only thing left is to figure out where we can store the approx 7-10TB of data that is generated in th test, it will be very expensive to leave it on EFS. I can look at another AWS option and check prices if we dont already have access to something to store this on?

[14-Aug-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What about some explorers for the first 64 chains? Do we need/want those?

[14-Aug-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
would be good to have explorers so skeptics can just look up the chain data on them

[14-Aug-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the satinder nodes can do exploreres too?

[14-Aug-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They probably can if I spread the explorers over the 3 servers. I can run a 64 chain test on this and test load.

[14-Aug-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are 256GB of ram, and the CPU in them was very fast, just small amount of cores.

[14-Aug-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181

nice article. learnt a bit how transactions are handled in eth in layman's term. üëç

[16-Aug-18 02:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for companies who only need transactional tokens, a simplest assertchain would be more than enough.

[17-Aug-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`8859 / 60 = 147 `
We have 2MB blocks, each can fit 8859 TX of single payment inside, and we have 60s block time.
Each assetchain can do just under 150 TX/s
But if you batch the TX's and do more payments per TX, you can get much bigger numbers.
If every TX is 100 payments for example the calcuation is:
`557 * 100 /60 = 928` Payments per second.

[17-Aug-18 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can use as many assetchains as you like for unlimited transacion capacity. It scales linear.
