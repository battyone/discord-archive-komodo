Maybe he can help just getting the KomodoPlatform account working?

[11-Jun-18 09:57 AM] grewalsatinder#0000
Yes that'd also help

[11-Jun-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I only need a 64 or 128vCPU to get moving on the next stage.

[11-Jun-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Once those tests are done, then we would have an exact figure.

[11-Jun-18 09:58 AM] grewalsatinder#0000
Right now he's spending time with family, so I understand his priorities.

[11-Jun-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Thats fine. When he has time, it would be much appreciated if he could help. üôÇ

[11-Jun-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#0000
I can use hour current meshbits AWS account, but Nitin has placed intentional limits on it.

[11-Jun-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#0000
Also don't want to mix scaling test expenses with notary.

[11-Jun-18 10:01 AM] grewalsatinder#0000
You mean we have our own KomodoPlatform AWS account now?

[11-Jun-18 10:01 AM] grewalsatinder#0000
That's great!

[11-Jun-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah not great idea to do that. I have no issue waiting, its getting late at night down here anyway, if he gets back to me tomrrow I am on with that. I think 1 day is long enough for my next lot of testing.

[11-Jun-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Steve Lee got us one, yes. But it says its blocked for some reason. Maybe I just dont know how to use it. But I tried a few diffrent ways.

[11-Jun-18 10:03 AM] grewalsatinder#0000
Awesome mate, I will give him a call and see how things go. Will update here.

[11-Jun-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#0000
No problem.

[11-Jun-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Thank you üôÇ

[11-Jun-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#0000

blackjok3r hey mate, how are you?
@grewalsatinder just mentioned to me that you need some help with aws account.

[11-Jun-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yes I will DM.

[11-Jun-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#0000

Is Steve Lee in this room (or in matrix.org at all) ?
Context: need to speak to him about the aws account

[11-Jun-18 11:15 AM] cryptoon#0000
@Steve Lee

[11-Jun-18 05:03 PM] tylor#0000
I have an AWS account that can be used for the test...

ns408 do you need my aws account details?

[11-Jun-18 05:49 PM] n2okpride#0000
I've got a call with our partner manager setup for 3pm PST today. @blackjok3r patchkez ns408 can you guys give me a range in funding we need to ask for please?

[11-Jun-18 05:54 PM] jl777#0000
for the big test it depends on how many chains they want

[11-Jun-18 05:54 PM] jl777#0000
#of chains * 2 cores * 1 hour

[11-Jun-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I think I can fit more chains than 1 on 2 cores, but this is something I need to test.

[11-Jun-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
8196 chains gets us to 1.2Million TX/s

[11-Jun-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
and that is what I have generated configs for.

[11-Jun-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Quick calculation comes out at about $50,000 per hour at 2 core per chain. and I am not sure you can even start 16392 containers and run the test withing a single hour

[11-Jun-18 05:55 PM] jl777#0000
so enough for 20,000 core hours should be enough to achieve the million tx/s

[11-Jun-18 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Its hard to say without actaully testing on AWS itself.

[11-Jun-18 05:58 PM] jl777#0000
yes, that is why we need the credits, so we can verify things

[11-Jun-18 06:00 PM] blackjok3r#0000
mining can be limited to 1/4 core on VULTR without issue. If we can do this on AWS, it will save a lot of money.

[11-Jun-18 06:02 PM] n2okpride#0000
can you provide a document i can present later today so i'm prepared to make the right funding request?

[11-Jun-18 06:02 PM] n2okpride#0000
i know there needs to be some initial testing to get the sizing correct, so let's split that project cost from the wider stress test requirements

[11-Jun-18 06:08 PM] n2okpride#0000
partner manager also indicated we'd need to identify which AWS products will be in use

[11-Jun-18 06:09 PM] n2okpride#0000
On our call last week they did mention the use of spot instances. let's try and factor that as an option in the proposal if it makes sense and meets our req

[11-Jun-18 06:10 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I tried to use spot for my tests on EC2, but that is not what will be used for full scale test.

[11-Jun-18 06:17 PM] patchkez#0000
for initial testing, I think we are good with 3 x `c5.2xlarge` instances which is 3 x 0.34$ per hour. we need to deploy these instances in one of these regions: 
`US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)` or `US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)` where EKS service is available.
So it is like 1$ per hour for 3 instances, maybe we need to test 7 days (not full 24 hours per day, once we are done with testing for the day we can stop instance in order to not be charged). So it is like 84$ for instances. 
We will use Amazon EKS (managed Kubernetes Service), Amazon Elastic Block store.
It is hard to predict exact cost because they charge you almost for everything e.g. network traffic.

[11-Jun-18 07:13 PM] patchkez#0000
@Steve Lee ah and I forgot, we will use also DynamoDB

[12-Jun-18 05:00 AM] Mylo#8306
what's the fastest way i can load up a docker image just to fire off a curl command?
i want to "DoS" the api for blocknotify to hit and simulate the load for dynamodb.

doing 1000 writes/s, the 'monthly' cost is $483. ($17/day)
doing 5000 writes/s, monthly cost is $2420 ($80/day)


Reads cost only 20% of writes, wouldn't need more than 10 reads/s tbh....so $2/month

If a docker image can be created and 8192 containers fired up over a few servers to fire off a curl command all within 10 seconds or so (passing in an env variable to POST to DynamoDB) should be able to work out DynamoDB costs.

[12-Jun-18 05:02 AM] Mylo#8306
env variable will just be the incremental instance number, fetching this from AWS to make sure it got written and to inspect the logs of any failures.

[12-Jun-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats a great idea.

[12-Jun-18 10:57 AM] Mylo#8306
hehe this channel isn't bridged - dropped out of slack i think

[12-Jun-18 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r `"ScannedCount": 40782, ` from your blocknotify url thingy.  working out what to do with it

[14-Jun-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
scanned count?

[14-Jun-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
{ "size": 1999062, "height": 134, "time": 1528887320, "totaltx": 8859, "ac": "TXSCL006", "mempooltx": 18787, "mempoolMB": 4 }

[14-Jun-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I output that?

[14-Jun-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but mempool can probably be removed once I am finished testing.

[14-Jun-18 12:57 AM] Mylo#8306
40k entries in the table

[14-Jun-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its required for debuging the code but once thats perfect It can go, as stats site does not use it.

[14-Jun-18 12:57 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah 40k of those

[14-Jun-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh I got you..

[14-Jun-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can wipe it if you like

[14-Jun-18 12:58 AM] Mylo#8306
i'll use it for test data and give you a new URL

[14-Jun-18 12:58 AM] Mylo#8306
when is next test?

[14-Jun-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I would like is the stats site to be working so I can see if chains are working in sync.

[14-Jun-18 12:58 AM] Mylo#8306
yep

[14-Jun-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to rewrite some code today to help with keeping chain events in sync. I will let you know. for now do you want me to disabe the cURL push?

[14-Jun-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to stop flooding the DB with data?

[14-Jun-18 01:00 AM] Mylo#8306
nah keep pushing,.  i'll look at the metrics from yesterday to see what 1 write/s looks like and how many times it got broken through

[14-Jun-18 01:00 AM] Mylo#8306
40k records isn't much.

[14-Jun-18 01:00 AM] Mylo#8306
need to know when it breaks

[14-Jun-18 01:01 AM] Mylo#8306
so if i need to give you an updated URL, do you need to rebuild docker or can you do it at runtime?

[14-Jun-18 01:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool. this test uses 64 chains, so it should scale linearly to X.

[14-Jun-18 01:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its goes in the docker-compose.yml.... so the docker image does not need to be rebuilt. but it cannot change mid test.

[14-Jun-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless I make it pull the url from shared data dir ü§î

[14-Jun-18 01:02 AM] Mylo#8306
oh that's cool, we can update the url pretty easily and cheaply (process wise)

[14-Jun-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I dont think thats needed, as restarting test is trivial.

sorted by time.  looks like you tested with TXSCL220 for a bit before the blast started

[14-Jun-18 02:00 AM] Mylo#8306
so i'm gonna have to update what you send to that blocknotify url when i need to process stuff, every 5 seconds or something, set a colum `postprocessing` or any arbitrary name.

anything with no value (fresh block info) i'll update with 0 as in postprocessing=0, it's ready to be processed.
after bing processed postprocessing=1 
at this stage, it has been aggregated into some other table for @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator to chuck into cartography

[14-Jun-18 02:02 AM] Mylo#8306
found some limits AWS puts on stuff - like lambda functions limited to 1000 iterations, retrieval of DB stuff 1MB of data otherwise multiple queries etc.
so these limis sort of force a "quick" processing paradigm i guess üòÑ

[14-Jun-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha.. just le me know what I need to change on my end.. got distracted reading verus whitepaper. will make a coffee and start on new code shortly.

[14-Jun-18 02:13 AM] Mylo#8306
up to smk

[14-Jun-18 02:14 AM] Mylo#8306
then i'll need to make something work with what we're doing.  he said somtething liek URL?time-since GET vars to then get the latest or seomthing.

[14-Jun-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I think he wanted to fetch everything for last 2000  entries then filter out what he already had... but if you can do that on the DB via that method you just said, then thats even better.

[14-Jun-18 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using the lambda to fetch the start trigger, is there some way I can see limits and usage of that? Its on my own free AWS account, and so far seems it hasnt charged me anything.

[14-Jun-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I read 1M requests was free... but not sure how many it handles at once or anything.

[14-Jun-18 02:31 AM] Mylo#8306
1000 at once i think....concurrent lambda functions being run....i think you'll be right.  i read a post about someone having 10k users on their site and they were worried about all users on the site doign stuff....

if we find we hit limits, then to split up URL for each 64 chains in the docker-compose file will be no probs, because i can aggregate the data for smk across any number of urls
