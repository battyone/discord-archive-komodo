@TonyL has many examples of how to do this

[14-Dec-18 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
@SuSC135 You can find some examples here: https://github.com/tonymorony/cryptoconditions_tui

Is there any examples of utilizing the rpc calls from a website? Does the end user need to have agama open and the chain running on native mode for the rpc calls to run?

[17-Dec-18 08:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Smedley that is a security issue, which is why many things are designed to prevent a website from talking to your local wallet. Otherwise, random websites could steal your money. This kind of bug has happened before

[17-Dec-18 08:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
older versions of Electrum had a bug that let evil websites talk to your local wallet and potentially steal funds, and definitely lose privacy/etc

[17-Dec-18 08:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Smedley if you are looking to call RPCs from node/Javascript (for instance, from a native Electron app), this might help: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng/blob/master/src/renderer/store/index.js#L360

@dukeleto Thanks for the resources and explanation. So currently making a dapp on a website is not a possibility?

[17-Dec-18 11:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can do it sure

[17-Dec-18 11:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I've been thinking of something just like that for #kmdlabs. There are plentybof RPC calls that don't have anything to do with funds, and a node with its wallet disabled should be fine for that type of thing, but it depends what u want to do.

[18-Dec-18 12:50 AM] Smedley#8094
Would assets contract potentially work?

[18-Dec-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You would need to be able to create al the transactions locally on your website

[18-Dec-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When I mean it cannot use a wallet .... I kind of mean that the deamon litteralyl has no wallet compiled in.

[18-Dec-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The are probably other ways to do it ... but apart from creating all the transacions with some java script library locally and using SPV or something to send th eraw hex to the blockchain ... I'm not sure it can be done . The other way is something like @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 's DragonHound... Its due for a pre release soon so show what he has been able to accomplish. This projec uses 1 central server, and "logins" for multiple "users" to post GPS locations to the blockchain. Started out to track his exacaping dog but realy has evolved into something quite awesome, that ca be used to stro any sensor data on the blockchain.

[18-Dec-18 02:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

There's an option to create a virtual hound for demo, but designed to use particle.io asset tracker hardware for those with a hardware token

There will be a Binance Prehackathon on Jan 12, 2018 in Hong Kong. It will be an amazing time to code and meet hackers, with some prizes at the end. Details on safuhack.com
Looks like a free event for not only developers, anyone interested to join?

Hey I have written this code in python to get info.  But I am getting a a error. It says ujson needs an object or a variable. I am assuming that getinfo methods needs some kind of input parameter.  Is my call correct. My daemon is running and I am getting result if I try from the shell.

whole bunch of python rpc calls in there, credit for most of it goes to @Alright

[18-Dec-18 11:44 PM] SuSC135#6248
Yeah this document is very useful . Thank You

[18-Dec-18 11:46 PM] SuSC135#6248
I rewrote my code and now I am getting 401 response from my code. I don't understand how to connect to my particular asset chain.

[18-Dec-18 11:46 PM] SuSC135#6248
``from __future__ import print_function
import requests, json , platform, re
rpcPort = 30177
rpcUser = 'UserName'

        "method": "getinfo",

    response = requests.post(serverURL, data=json.dumps(payload), auth = None)
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    raise Exception("Couldn't connect to " + serverURL + ": ", e)``

[19-Dec-18 01:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
To debug,  need to see if it client or server side. 
Ports open where needed?

[19-Dec-18 01:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Also check your rpc creds dont have troublesome special chars

[19-Dec-18 01:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had issues with a password containing backslashes a while ago

[19-Dec-18 02:31 AM] SuSC135#6248
What sort of issues will the server side code gives? Because I installed the komodo as per the documents and its running fine in the shell.

[19-Dec-18 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@SuSC135 Which error do you receive on:
```rpc_connection = Proxy("http://Username:Password@127.0.0.1:30177")
print(rpc_connection.getinfo())``` ?

[19-Dec-18 02:33 AM] SuSC135#6248
`` resp = ujson.loads(body.getvalue())
ValueError: Expected object or value``

[19-Dec-18 02:34 AM] SuSC135#6248
I get this error so I assumed maybe getinfo wants my asset chain parametes

[19-Dec-18 02:36 AM] TonyL#3577
There is no any params needed for getinfo call. I guess there is a auth issue when you've tried to create rpc_connection to your assetchain daemon

[19-Dec-18 02:38 AM] TonyL#3577
@SuSC135  Is it work by curl?
```curl --user myrpcuser:myrpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:myrpcport/```

[19-Dec-18 02:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe `rpcallowip` param is missing in `.conf` for your assetchain

[19-Dec-18 02:39 AM] TonyL#3577
it should be `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1` if you want to make RPC calls from localhost

[19-Dec-18 02:40 AM] SuSC135#6248
``$ curl --user UserName:Password --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:30177/

I am ruuning komodo on a windows machine

[19-Dec-18 02:47 AM] TonyL#3577
It should be a network/routing issue, since you cant establish RPC call via curl you cant do it with the same credentials in your python program as well

[19-Dec-18 02:52 AM] SuSC135#6248
What do you suggest I should do to debug this?

[19-Dec-18 02:52 AM] SuSC135#6248
Should I just run the komodo in a virtual env and try to access it form there?

[19-Dec-18 02:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, just to understand picture better: is machine/os with komodo daemon and machine/os from which you're trying to do RPC calls are the same one?

[19-Dec-18 02:55 AM] SuSC135#6248
yes I am running daemon and trying to access it from the same machine . Its windows 10

[19-Dec-18 02:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Anything in debug.log?

[19-Dec-18 02:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Maybe win is disalowing run? Whats the win equivalent of chmod?

[19-Dec-18 02:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw maybe curl request example above isn't valid for Windows. Never tried to curl/RPC connect to komodod on Windows tbh

[19-Dec-18 03:00 AM] SuSC135#6248
Well yeah I can make komodo global environment variable

[19-Dec-18 03:00 AM] SuSC135#6248
I used a Mingw64 a wrapper for windows to do a curl call

[19-Dec-18 03:00 AM] SuSC135#6248
Like GitBash

[19-Dec-18 03:16 AM] TonyL#3577
@SuSC135 Are you trying to call `getinfo` on KMD chain or assetchain?

[19-Dec-18 03:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Just noticed that you get 401 Unauthorized for one of your RPC call methods

[19-Dec-18 03:18 AM] SuSC135#6248
I am trying it on my assets chain

[19-Dec-18 03:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, thats where is the clue

[19-Dec-18 03:18 AM] SuSC135#6248
Should i include the name of my asset chain or txid somewhere?

[19-Dec-18 03:19 AM] TonyL#3577
username/password for assetchain connection store in /.komodo/%assetchainname%/%assetchainname%.conf

[19-Dec-18 03:20 AM] TonyL#3577
So there should be the folder with your assetchain name in same folder with `komodo.conf`

[19-Dec-18 03:20 AM] TonyL#3577
And inside this folder `assetchainname.conf` which defines connection params to your assetchain daemon

[19-Dec-18 03:21 AM] TonyL#3577
So you need to allow rpc connections in this assetchain config, restart assetchain daemon and try again your RPC calls with username/password same as in `assetchainname.conf`

[19-Dec-18 03:22 AM] SuSC135#6248
Ok this is what i was missing out on. Let me try this

[20-Dec-18 06:44 PM] jorian#4555
:trollface:

[20-Dec-18 06:44 PM] jorian#4555
which coin?

[20-Dec-18 06:59 PM] SuSC135#6248
Komodo coins

[20-Dec-18 06:59 PM] SuSC135#6248
And how do I mine

[20-Dec-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if you create your own chain you can specify how many coins you want

[20-Dec-18 09:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 the CL flag `-gen=1` turns on CPU solo mining and `-genproclimit=N` will use N cores/threads

[20-Dec-18 09:31 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512

[20-Dec-18 09:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
