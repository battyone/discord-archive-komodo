also, which branch and commit or binary are you using?

[14-Sep-19 07:43 AM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@dukeleto I'm in Amsterdam and I even used a VPN to go to sweden, so I doubt it was that. I asked my question in Dev and they solved it! Feel free to look at it üôÇ

[14-Sep-19 07:43 AM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Thanks for answering!

@hyperDEX Very intrested, almost the same guide but with some different commands I'll give it a go on another server since @gcharang gave me the binaries that allowed it to work regardless if I could download or not. However, I would like to find the best "good path" so that my students can replicate it üôÇ

Sounds good

What is the path to become / learn more about being kmd dev? I know python, matlab, sql stuff only. Where should I start? Learn C++, get andreas book?

[19-Oct-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
start as a tester

[19-Oct-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
pick what is interesting to you and start helping by finding bugs

[19-Oct-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you can then start automating things

[19-Oct-19 05:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
checkout #kmdlabs

@idrtis follow jl777's advice.
get to understand Komodo Platform and and how it works.
Start from here: https://developers.komodoplatform.com

[19-Oct-19 06:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see you have python skills. You can test the APIs of new and old cryptoconditions applications and may be make some test or reference applications.

[19-Oct-19 06:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
see what progamming libraries there are for the languages you know for KMD

[19-Oct-19 06:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and see if you can either improve those or if those doesn't exists, may be make those for devs like yourself who might use them

[19-Oct-19 06:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if like writing and documenting, that will also be good to have.

[19-Oct-19 06:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can write what you learned and see if you like to contribute to documentation side of stuff if like.

[25-Oct-19 01:53 PM] PTYX#6840
