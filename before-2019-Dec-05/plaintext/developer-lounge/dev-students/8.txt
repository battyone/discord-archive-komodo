Aha, so did you started this komodod daemon with `-pubkey= 026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530` param?

[22-Dec-18 08:01 PM] TonyL#3577
`komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=ChannelTest channelsopen 026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530` and if you're executing all calls on the same node - it seems you are opening channel which have no sense (between your wallet and your wallet)

[22-Dec-18 08:03 PM] TonyL#3577
In `channelsopen` you have to specify a destination pubkey. 
First side (sender) is your wallet with "026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530" pubkey and second side (payments recipient) will be a wallet which belongs to pubkey which you specify in `channelsopen`

[22-Dec-18 08:07 PM] SuSC135#6248
no i started the daemon with another pubkey

[22-Dec-18 08:07 PM] SuSC135#6248
``komodod.exe -ac_name=ChannelTest -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_perc=10000000  -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1  -pubkey=0377cee24bd2b5f6c11ccc8c5cffe717abe5e7448ce1fa6f0f3d5285d01f7c0e37 &``

[22-Dec-18 08:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Thats why you are getting this error: ```error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet
```

[22-Dec-18 08:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Because to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet

[22-Dec-18 08:08 PM] TonyL#3577
And valid pubkey for your wallet is `026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530`

[22-Dec-18 08:18 PM] SuSC135#6248
Is there any command to check the number of pubkey associated with my asset chain

[22-Dec-18 08:19 PM] SuSC135#6248
now I started the my daemon with this 026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530 address

[22-Dec-18 08:19 PM] SuSC135#6248

[22-Dec-18 08:20 PM] TonyL#3577
In general you can get a list of addresses:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY7 getaddressesbyaccount ""
[
  "RJ8cuSGzBEVr7mD988tPVdMvTy2kgieJr6",
  "RNfviykgepoYjRL9ePcuHHuHJwxBGGVcgh",
  "RPCUimGv3pCz9wxErrtwJxFN713Uva57oH",
  "RPRn9JnSFmYVkyvRbBUxPZtKtdxojEbgWk",
  "RR37QdE7XMKcXSmQE8mZzxpMy9jMhtE1ef",
  "RXbSJSWangktGCmqWVxTjXTMQhXymYNryM",
  "RYYpCfudys4E3CAJyBq9KEv33NgCaiYoRw"
]
```
And then get a pubkey from each `validateaddress` for each address

[22-Dec-18 08:20 PM] TonyL#3577
If you want to have all `pubkey`'s

[22-Dec-18 08:20 PM] TonyL#3577
But you can start the daemon with any valid

[22-Dec-18 08:21 PM] SuSC135#6248
Oh!! I can try this and see if the address are valid . And then I can start daemon with one of these addresses and open a channel with any other address present in my assets chain

[22-Dec-18 08:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Exactly 👍 But start daemon not with address but pubkey. Or other way you can just get a valid address for your wallet any time by `getaccountaddress ""` without generating new one

[22-Dec-18 08:23 PM] TonyL#3577
In general `pubkey=` daemon param needed for any CC operating, not just channelsCC

[22-Dec-18 09:35 PM] SuSC135#6248
Is it necessary that daemon with the destination pubkey be running?

[22-Dec-18 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577
It shouldn't be necessary

[23-Dec-18 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326

@dukeleto Thanks! Bought some `kmd.` and `komodo.` domains - one of the ideas for usage is to make a blog with how-tos and video guides next year 😃 
@SuSC135 Could you please call `-ac_name=SusChannel getinfo` and share the output? I have no luck to get this error on my side in case of valid pubkey usage

[24-Dec-18 01:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Also could you please share a link on binary or repo/branch from which you've compiled komodod? (so I'll able to check same version on windows too)

Software version which you use most probably not compatible with current CC at all.

 `"connections": 0` also you have only one node now on your AC - so there is no nodes with which you can open your channel

[24-Dec-18 01:49 AM] TonyL#3577
```"blocks": 0,
  "longestchain": 0,```
On one of the nodes you might want to enable mining by `setgenerate true`

@SuSC135 being able to compile the latest version of whichever KMD branch you want, is going to be very valuable. Until you get that working, make sure to use the very latest binaries you can find, usually only a few days/weeks old, as they are make frequently

[24-Dec-18 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 if you download (or already have the latest Agama wallet) and start Komodo in "native mode", that will actually start a full komodod process on your machine, and you can talk to it with komodo-cli

[24-Dec-18 01:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
even so, cryptoconditions stuff is very new, and you might need to compile a certain branch, like FSM or jl777

[24-Dec-18 11:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Also anyway to compile Windows binaries from custom branches Ubuntu needed, so it might be a good idea to switch to Ubuntu in general and test everything on it

[24-Dec-18 11:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
16.04 minimal server in VM gives a 10GB image.... install komodo into that... then clone it to test. No problem to boot 2-4 of them on a reasonable PC with VirtualBox and test anything you need. Can even use windows as a host if you must. I did that early on before getting linux host working.

try `ls -al ~/`

[25-Jan-19 01:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if the `.komodo` folder is owned by root, you need to chown to make it owned by 'komodo'

[25-Jan-19 01:57 AM] SuSC135#6248
yup its owned by the root

[25-Jan-19 01:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
best to chown recursive through the .komodo folder too or the same issues will come up again.

sudo chown -R komodo /home/komodo/*

[25-Jan-19 02:00 AM] SuSC135#6248
instead of komodo i do .komodo

[25-Jan-19 02:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
` /home/komodo` is the user home folder.
` /home/komodo/.komodo` is the data folder.
if the data folder is owned by root, you cant create subfolders in it, even if all the files in it are owned by `komodo`

[25-Jan-19 02:18 AM] SuSC135#6248
I tried sudo chown -R komodo  /home/komodo/.komodo

[25-Jan-19 02:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
try `sudo chown -R komodo /home/komodo`

how long does it take to mine all the pre-mined coins?

[25-Jan-19 02:42 AM] SuSC135#6248
Just checking is this the right way

you'll need to add `-gen` to the launch string

[25-Jan-19 02:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
e.g. `./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=777777 -addnode=192.168.167.1 -gen &`

[25-Jan-19 02:45 AM] SuSC135#6248
**./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=<IP address of the first node> -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc)**

[25-Jan-19 02:45 AM] SuSC135#6248
I used that command

[25-Jan-19 02:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
use `komodo-cli -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN getinfo` to see how many blocks have been generated

[25-Jan-19 02:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if first node premine is 100 blocks, it'll take about 100 minutes

This is the info of my secondnode

[25-Jan-19 03:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
first node is responsible for premine, second needs to wait (I think).

[25-Jan-19 03:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
some of the guys in #kmdlabs  might be able to help 👍

[25-Jan-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
@SuSC135 you're using `-ac_name=HELLOWORLD` on both nodes, yes?

[25-Jan-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
`  "blocks": 0,` means block 1 was not mined

[25-Jan-19 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
once the nodes are connected, try `komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD setgenerate true $(nproc)`

[25-Jan-19 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
you can do `komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD getpeerinfo` to confirm they are connected

[25-Jan-19 05:01 AM] SuSC135#6248
Yes I'm using hello world on both nodes

[25-Jan-19 05:01 AM] SuSC135#6248
Let me check this

on small networks, longestchain might stay 0.   @Alright ?  look at screenshot

[25-Jan-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
connections cant be 0 for mining

[25-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo longestchain 0 is typically an indication of network having forks

[25-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Alright#0419
at least one of his nodes should show blocks >0 if it's working
