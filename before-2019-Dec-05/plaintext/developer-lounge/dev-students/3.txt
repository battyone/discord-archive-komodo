no, i mean like rewards, you can define and find arbitrary number of plans with different parameters

[12-Oct-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
just imagine a faucet2 CC with the flexibility of rewards

[12-Oct-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing to do with restarting the blockchain

[12-Oct-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and just one hardfork to activate faucet2

[12-Oct-18 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
faucet2create <param0> <param1> <param2> <param3>

[12-Oct-18 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
then any usage of faucet2... <createtxid> would use those parameters

[12-Oct-18 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
right now there is one faucet, globally

[12-Oct-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is no faucetcreate txid, it is implictly the only faucet

[12-Oct-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but different faucets would want different amounts, different ways of spam prevention different tx PoW, just off the top of my head

[12-Oct-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not saying make a faucet that is a rewards system

[12-Oct-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
I am saying make a faucet2 that is configurable at faucet creation time, like rewards is configurable at rewards creation time

[12-Oct-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[18-Oct-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
uthash.h
it has hashing and even simple queue stuff
i use DL_APPEND to add to a queue and then you can iterate through the queue
read all the uthash docs, it will make you a much more efficient coder
http://www.cs.bu.edu/~jappavoo/Resources/psml/apps/hashy/uthash/doc/userguide.html
https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/utlist.html
utlist is the queue, start with that
you can grep my code for the actual usages
i cant remember how many places i used it
basically when a new item comes in, malloc a structure, set the fields, DL_APPEND
now its in the list
where you need to query the list, just do that and if it returns something at the head of the list, you get a FIFO
if you get something from the tail of the list it is LIFO
really you MUST understand fully about how to use lists and hashtables. with utlist/uthash you dont have to learn to write the internals (though that in itself is very good learning when time is available)
80% of computing is searching and sorting, something like that

@jl777c wana ask what r ur thoughts about compiling all knowledge in one book about komodo...so its more easy for noobs to become devs or at least get a good start...to future hard work....

[22-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
there are a lot of docs being made by @gcharang and of course good docs are good to have

[22-Oct-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be a good way to learn all about KMD to collect all the info into a coherent form.

[22-Oct-18 05:27 PM] plazma#1625
@jl777c thanks.....😁 👌

All of our docs are here currently: http://docs.komodoplatform.com/
Eventhough they are all very usable and informative right now, they are aimed more at people who already know what they are doing.

More beginner friendly versions are on the way and the docs site will have an overhaul by January-2019
Till then please use the above docs and ask us here to fill any gaps in them.

[22-Oct-18 05:31 PM] plazma#1625

ill check

[23-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
it made literaly no difference by using the additional flag in the launch line

[23-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181

that has you using -gen on the first daemon

[23-Oct-18 11:59 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
kk.. so it doesnt really matter if you set the first one to try mine the genisis aswell?

i can figure this out given enough time i think

[23-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
ultimately.. i need an -ac option that allows for a block doubling style option as opposed to block halving

[23-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
even that is fine..
