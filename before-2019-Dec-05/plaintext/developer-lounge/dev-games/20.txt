@modereck lol, any game is possible

[12-Mar-19 12:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Tzar is an awesome game

[12-Mar-19 12:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Steve Lee a super puzzle fighter? Got a title you were especially in love with?

[12-Mar-19 12:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am personally a big fan of Dungeon Keeper Gold.

[12-Mar-19 12:58 AM] Regnar#6164
I have been thinking about useful features for blockchain games to have, I think having easy access to multiplayer information like PvP results, and a really simple way to get a Streaming key (like for Twitch) would be huge. I'm not sure what information will be visible on a block explorer, so having a way to read match results would really help with leaderboard and gambling sites . And the streaming key (OBS is open source <https://obsproject.com/>) would be helpful for getting the word out and showing the gameplay.

[12-Mar-19 12:59 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm pretty new to "streaming" games, so I'm not sure what exactly goes into the key. I figured you'd have more info on that, but overall I think it could prove useful to help spread awareness

[12-Mar-19 12:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar I got a record button on my laptop that makes instant MP4 in 720p or 1080p, sadly I don't have Discord Nitro (so I need to crop stuff and hit that 5mb limit)

[12-Mar-19 01:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
or do you mean for Twitch?

[12-Mar-19 01:00 AM] Regnar#6164
Twitch is what I was thinking

[12-Mar-19 01:00 AM] Regnar#6164
for live streaming

[12-Mar-19 01:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
lol and who would do the streaming

[12-Mar-19 01:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am not a fit person for that, I am horrible

[12-Mar-19 01:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
swearing, cursing etc

lol that's the surprising part, apparently a ton of people put themselves on camera and on the interwebs, even when they suck

[12-Mar-19 01:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I make Linus Torvalds a fucking saint compared to my f-bombs

[12-Mar-19 01:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Steve Lee oh! those! addictive!

[12-Mar-19 01:01 AM] Steve Lee#1967
my favorite puzzle game

[12-Mar-19 01:01 AM] Steve Lee#1967
more niche

[12-Mar-19 01:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
blockgame version; with leaderboard?

[12-Mar-19 01:01 AM] Steve Lee#1967
but after tetris it should be columns then super puzzle bobble

[12-Mar-19 01:02 AM] Steve Lee#1967
yes! and 1on1 betting

[12-Mar-19 01:02 AM] Regnar#6164
but I'm more talking about building those types of easy integrations, like if there is a simple way to generate a Twitch key. Komodo games could have a feature to give access to a Twitch key to players right in the settings (should the developer choose to incorporate it)

[12-Mar-19 01:02 AM] Steve Lee#1967
capcom tried to reboot it as a mobile game but abandoned it again sadly

[12-Mar-19 01:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
heh, well maybe KMD rises to the moon so instead of a lambo I'd just work a whole year just making games.

[12-Mar-19 01:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the big studios have shareholders, so they need over 35% return.

[12-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Regnar#6164
the 5% rewards you can use for the lambo

[12-Mar-19 01:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
5% rewards?

[12-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Regnar#6164
KMD

[12-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Regnar#6164
it accrues 5.1% yearly on itself

[12-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Regnar#6164
claim it once a month

[12-Mar-19 01:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar I am here just for a week, haven't really read into the details

[12-Mar-19 01:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, thats nice

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I basically have two "dream games" I'd love to create, but can't because of copyright

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Regnar#6164
ahh well yea, if you have some KMD. Use Agama or another wallet that will let you claim rewards and it will grow with more KMD every second. Just claim it once a month (press a button on the wallet)

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Regnar#6164
which ones?

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
One is dungeon keeper gold and the other one is Star Fox

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Regnar#6164
ohhh star fox

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Regnar#6164
just make "star Badger"

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I have some KMD, but its like from tips I got here.

[12-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Regnar#6164
ah yea I don't know if the tipbot accrues rewards

[12-Mar-19 01:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Basically my medication eats most of my "fun money"

[12-Mar-19 01:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, doesn't matter. If I'm lucky, I'll be lucky.

[12-Mar-19 01:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
üòÑ

[12-Mar-19 01:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Maybe a list of games and dICO's per title wouldn't that be a cool thing?

[12-Mar-19 01:08 AM] Regnar#6164
yea, you'd have to have a token to trade for the funds in the dICO model though

[12-Mar-19 01:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, I wouldn't even go into that kind of detail, I just love tech and games (mostly games)

[12-Mar-19 01:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that kind of stuff is more for the crypto economist kind

[12-Mar-19 01:09 AM] Regnar#6164
dICOs are all atomic swaps, coin for coin. Makes sense for selling NFTs to raise funds for a game though, plus I think it would be much more friendly legal wise, as they are buying an asset that has a function (in game) and isn't for speculation... üòâ

[12-Mar-19 01:10 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
üòÉ I rather think about lerping quaternions üòõ

[12-Mar-19 01:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I got plenty of skills but that stuff isn't one of them xD

[12-Mar-19 01:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
meanwhile - I finished the crafting system of War Chain, so time to gather some icons

I just had the most stupid idea

[12-Mar-19 01:33 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64  can I see the face of an elf please?

[12-Mar-19 01:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
wua you are just a second too late, I was building hang on I cancel it

[12-Mar-19 01:34 AM] Cryptofist#7504
all good

[12-Mar-19 01:34 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I have a voice ive been playing with just want to make sure it fits

[12-Mar-19 01:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes, those fit

[12-Mar-19 01:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also, the stupid idea

[12-Mar-19 01:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there isn't a blockgame store

[12-Mar-19 01:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there should a game store for blockchain powered games xD

[12-Mar-19 01:48 AM] Regnar#6164
and also the blockchain game assets, to include p2p stuff like full characters.

[12-Mar-19 01:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@TwilightPunkster K64 - that‚Äôs what I was talking about yesterday.

[12-Mar-19 01:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
$CREDS chain.   dICO for an online arcade and game store.

[12-Mar-19 01:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts well, Komodo Team has been super supportive regarding my game dev, so my bet is that they would love that too.

[12-Mar-19 01:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Heh

[12-Mar-19 01:52 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Hmm

[12-Mar-19 01:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôve already written down some plans

[12-Mar-19 01:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you probably need to write proposals, as you most likely have to attract funds before you can pull that off.

[12-Mar-19 01:55 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and a reel of games

[12-Mar-19 01:55 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
finished games, not half assed ones

[12-Mar-19 01:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically around 30-45 titles on launch, else you'd be a studio, and 10-15 releases monthly.

[12-Mar-19 01:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
That's one full time job for you, cap.

[12-Mar-19 01:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Just managing all that stuff.

[12-Mar-19 01:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
You definitely need a full time 2d artist, because well, visuals, visuals.

[12-Mar-19 01:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
webdesign and payment processing is just easy, but you will probably need one networking dude just to integrate and toolify stuff.

[12-Mar-19 01:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
meaning, someone who understands a Linux box as like they were born in its kernel

[12-Mar-19 01:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, and then there is the marketing drama

[12-Mar-19 01:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the amount of PR

[12-Mar-19 01:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
not to mention the horrible coffee at PR events.

[12-Mar-19 01:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[12-Mar-19 02:10 AM] Meyse#0952
@TwilightPunkster K64 i already had the idea of a Komodo powered dApp store, can also include games yeah üòÑ

[12-Mar-19 02:12 AM] Meyse#0952
more like a platform not a store tho

```

```
Yes, just a base level for save game data for portability across platforms.

[12-Mar-19 04:20 AM] Mylo#8306
Simple solution.
If gamestate and rules are onchain, cross play also much easier because of unified data format (protocol + state) for a game, its characters etc.

[12-Mar-19 04:22 AM] Mylo#8306
Tools like construct.net where game rules are GUI programmed/ easily scripted can live as a json description.  If you follow
