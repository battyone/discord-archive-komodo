Who are you contacting for investments? 'Classic' Dutch funds or crypto related funds?

[29-Mar-19 12:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
We got a mixture of funding and investors. I include, not exclude.

Goodfuckingmorning world.

[29-Mar-19 08:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Today's update: the formula 1 team has been assembled. We have decided that we will not use typical titles, but descriptions that tell you the stuff we do. Like fighter pilots have Maverick, Iceman, Goose, Viper, we are going for those instead.

[29-Mar-19 08:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The core team: Sam (Tech), Max (Creative), Willem (Numbers), Renzo (Promo), Miranda (Operations), Ryan (Growth). We now have 2 assisting game developers, Simon and Otgoo, our concept artist Nik and our media magician Kenny.

[29-Mar-19 08:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
We made photos yesterday, we are working on the website, the reel of games and all the things that brings our profile out in the open.

[29-Mar-19 08:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Thanks to @Team  Admin who have super duper supported us in getting started up, @Mylo helping out in the shadows, and not to fucking forget the 35K boost from @KomodoWorld and  financial backing, support and endless energized @FishyGuts (Growth), we were able to secure the base of Komodore64. @Regnar even though not in k's, your 5 KMD for the fridge is just as important üòÉ 

Together we are strong.  Now let's disrupt, let's build, lets spread and take over the fucking world.

Thank you @Steve Lee - I will keep that in mind for future.   I think TPunk has someone working on an official site.   Mine was just going to be VERY basic.   Im glad he didn't like it üòÇ

[29-Mar-19 09:21 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
üòé its not that I didnt like it or at all appreciate the effort. We are working to get things streamlined, which just takes time; its the ocean that makes it difficult to sync properly. If it was up to me some people would fly in and we'd be super efficient, yet we have to be careful to burn money. We have funding and great things in the pipeline, but flights and residence are an investment and I rather spend the budget wisely.

[29-Mar-19 09:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

Alright. Great day. Daylight savings are funny, so amping up the velocity. Lotsa work has been done and much more needs to be done. So today a lot of work into the composition of the website, the reel - but also preparations for the upcoming week. Like freeing up my hands to prepare the operational things to run this all. Even though most things have been set up, the devil is in the detail.

Alright, so Twitter set up, a bunch of videos made and making notes, plans and stuff at the same time. The office has finally got trashcans, and 2 months before we move to the new office. Meanwhile finalizing the Unity SDK, and making some plans for next week. We're going as fast as we can, but sadly there are only 72 hours in a single day. Be patient, we are moving forward.

A minor accident created some delay in things. But that wont stop the music. Komodore64 is moving forward. We are writing up a whitepaper, setting up a website and gearing everything into motion. With partnerships in place, the team working hard to make gaming ready for the next level. A lot hasn't been displayed yet, such as the look and feel of the Komodo for Unity SDK, which embeds the 6AME language to quickly develop games that are powered by Komodo blockchain. We are moving as fast as we can. ‚ù§‚úåüòé

<https://krunker.io> is a cool block type game with rewards in it called KR. They aren't on chain or anything but I wonder if we could make something like that, or get them to use Komodo for their KR

I'm not sure of the specifics of how the SDK would help them integrate that, but would the SDK have tools for current games to easily switch current in-game credits to a blockchain based on?

@Regnar migration tools are not part of the SDK, however every coder understands the process of refactoring. If they use Unity or Unreal, it should be painless. However, in a perfect world, we'd help them to migrate

The philosophy behind the SDK is that we enable game developers to develop games with Komodo with ease and turnkey. Thats why we are creating materials and guides too, kind of like Loom does, with less buzz, fuzz and more pragmatic. However that will take some time.

We're officially partnered with @kmdchainmakers who will provide technical and legal support #games made with @KomodoPlatform for #Komodore64. Another strong move towards a bright future and how we as ecosystem developers collaborate!

"the Hague" is trending on Twitter right now

I think for the international court, something Trump related I assume.

Guess who is on our advisory board too? No one else than @bennydoda01 from @redfoxlabs_io who doesn't need any further introduction. Currently occupied with #RFOX #ieo (read more: https://t.co/zZFlr0BBM4). The future is bright! #Komodo $KMD

Games, #games and more games! We got so much projects that deserve to be fleshed out and become #Komodo powered #blockgames, like this little gem. Levels on the #blockchain, and #ProofOfGameplay. Oh, and we are making it #multiplayer. https://t.co/9FpEHvh32u

So much fun to bring back the days of #pointandclick and explore worlds. With @KomodoPlatform it is easy to store #NFT, and with the Komodo Gaming SDK, designing in #6AME makes it effortless to create unique items on the #blockchain!
