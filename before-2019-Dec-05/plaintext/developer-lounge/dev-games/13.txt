We can add NFT skins or something.  Maybe base resources to start but too much skews fairness especially if we move to a 1v1

[10-Mar-19 03:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cheat free should be specific xD

[10-Mar-19 03:12 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Can you provide mor einfo on how the game itself works @TwilightPunkster K64 ?   Is it really the same as W2

[10-Mar-19 03:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
did someone write up a standard, or a set of use cases? Rogue is all about cheat-free

[10-Mar-19 03:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup

[10-Mar-19 03:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
only difference is that its 3D, with a survival mode like minecraft, but that would be similar as playing a campaign

[10-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Rogue also has some more features that are blockchain based, Your avatar is a token, multiple sell-able accounts which can be used for winning multiplayer, and your in game gold is exchanged for a real currency ( getting paid to play)   

I think maybe we will find some good ideas as the game devlops more, I feel like we will need to add features to it.

[10-Mar-19 03:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
too late

[10-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Rewards based on gameplay was an idea.

[10-Mar-19 03:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, never add too many features to a game.

[10-Mar-19 03:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you end up breaking stuff.

[10-Mar-19 03:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Why not to start from cool 3D GUI for Rogue? Or cool 3D Rogue warriors marketplace üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 03:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, since I'm the only one coding this, I rather don't have too many features

[10-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Cryptofist#7504
All good

[10-Mar-19 03:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL lol, the whole idea to do this was to keep the terminal flair of Rogue as is

[10-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I was more thinking features as something built around the game.

[10-Mar-19 03:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(and add something new)

[10-Mar-19 03:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Ahh I see @TwilightPunkster K64

[10-Mar-19 03:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
features are the RTS in itself, but it should show the benefits of using the blockchain

[10-Mar-19 03:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
my personal one is to use cc-assets (Token)

[10-Mar-19 03:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but, the question is, what will make it the most fun for players

[10-Mar-19 03:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what is valuable to "keep"

[10-Mar-19 03:20 AM] TonyL#3577
üòÇ  skins

[10-Mar-19 03:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL what do you think about the game so far

[10-Mar-19 03:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hahahaa

[10-Mar-19 03:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, I had that idea

[10-Mar-19 03:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cryptokitty meets orcs

[10-Mar-19 03:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure so far how to connect RTS with collectables

[10-Mar-19 03:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Any item which you save will change balance

[10-Mar-19 03:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@TonyL - we talked about doing a 3D GUI for rogue and may pursue it after this and after rogue testing is ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù

[10-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
We should explore that idea a bit more.

[10-Mar-19 03:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cursor

[10-Mar-19 03:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what idea?

[10-Mar-19 03:23 AM] Cryptofist#7504
crypto kitties orcs

[10-Mar-19 03:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, start exploring

[10-Mar-19 03:23 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I am, just needed to dump it inmy brain

[10-Mar-19 03:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
my idea was to sacrifice units

[10-Mar-19 03:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[10-Mar-19 03:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
doing something liek cryto kitties at all on KMD is good too, so everyone can see the chain can handle such things.

[10-Mar-19 03:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Yay!

[10-Mar-19 03:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
(MTG player here, lets kill our own things)

[10-Mar-19 03:25 AM] wookie#7663
I just stumbled on this channel, is this GUI being built to be put onto ROGUE??

[10-Mar-19 03:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe a certain level of gaming can be done to generate an orc legend (NFT orc)

[10-Mar-19 03:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@wookie  seperate game system at the moment.

[10-Mar-19 03:26 AM] wookie#7663
Thanks, is there a beta out for testing or is the GUI the focus atm?

[10-Mar-19 03:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
will every game generate a new  entity on the blockchain?

[10-Mar-19 03:27 AM] Cryptofist#7504
It doesnt have to be that way, however more often than not, it will.

[10-Mar-19 03:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Only idea I have so far is a NFT "commander" which is not in-game movable unit but like a command  gameplay and can give some unique buffs

[10-Mar-19 03:27 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Say for ROGUE we can make additional games that used the same chain and tokens.

[10-Mar-19 03:27 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL  killer

[10-Mar-19 03:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL can you elaborate more, I think I had that kinda in my head

[10-Mar-19 03:28 AM] Cryptofist#7504
like speed bonuses or something? (or is that too much)

[10-Mar-19 03:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
I need to do some research on what enjin is doing

[10-Mar-19 03:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, one advice don't ask Maxim, because you will get only lies xD

[10-Mar-19 03:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, that might be mean.. but so is filing for a patent

[10-Mar-19 03:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
Do they have a proof of concept out yet? I mean we dont want to do the exact same shit right?

[10-Mar-19 03:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they have their fanboys gathered for GDC

[10-Mar-19 03:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@TwilightPunkster K64 yes, thinking - such commander or "hero" can have items also which should be hard to find (maybe in some tournaments or when you finish campaign)

[10-Mar-19 03:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they call it MultiVerse

[10-Mar-19 03:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Buffs are like a +x to trees cutting, +x to unit armor, +x to attack, some unique building

[10-Mar-19 03:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL yup, probably can even make it only spawn on certain conditions

[10-Mar-19 03:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ooooh

[10-Mar-19 03:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
TIME LIMIT

[10-Mar-19 03:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[10-Mar-19 03:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
as long as the buffs aren't permanent... it would still be balanced if the buff wore off.

{Reactions}
treasure 

[10-Mar-19 03:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
coins are burned as buffs wear off or resources are consumed

{Reactions}
treasure 

[10-Mar-19 03:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL rewards as buffs to a skill tree?

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10-Mar-19 03:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but like the one from Age of Empires

[10-Mar-19 03:42 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Sounds excellent. I always enjoyed being able to see the whole map for a period of time on W2

someone needs to tweet that with "coming soon"

[10-Mar-19 03:48 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
lol someone needs to record and remaster some voices

[10-Mar-19 03:48 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
some good ambient background music would be appreciated too

[10-Mar-19 03:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
what file types you need. mp3/4 .aiff .wav?

[10-Mar-19 03:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
ogg vorbis...

[10-Mar-19 03:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
wav are best

[10-Mar-19 03:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
looping ambient music

[10-Mar-19 03:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the kind that doesn't make you mad

[10-Mar-19 03:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
what file size?

[10-Mar-19 03:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also dont just rip shit from the internet, license crap.

[10-Mar-19 03:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
doesn't matter

[10-Mar-19 03:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
how much is too much size wize

[10-Mar-19 03:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
It gets auto compressed

[10-Mar-19 03:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, I got one game that is about 100+ gb.

[10-Mar-19 03:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, doesn't matter

[10-Mar-19 03:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
this is not a browser game

[10-Mar-19 03:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[10-Mar-19 03:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Im working on it right now @TwilightPunkster K64

[10-Mar-19 03:58 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Music would be amazing!

[10-Mar-19 03:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup

[10-Mar-19 03:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sounds good

[10-Mar-19 04:06 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Was the trimming on the sample good? @TwilightPunkster K64

[10-Mar-19 04:07 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I assumed it should be as tight as possible.

[10-Mar-19 04:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup

[10-Mar-19 04:17 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Any other silly orc saying ideas, drop em here

[10-Mar-19 04:17 AM] Regnar#6164
@TwilightPunkster K64 definitely meant it was cool! Keep it up!
