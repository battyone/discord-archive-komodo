too bad this is just a demo, so much potential.

[11-Mar-19 08:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
anyway, added temporarily background music.

[11-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Mylo#8306
looks like a lot of fun creating, toiling fun

[11-Mar-19 08:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
it is!

[11-Mar-19 08:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but there is always a big gap between working on a funny project and one that makes fun projects possible

[11-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Meyse#0952
When you click on the ground and a unit moves there, there should be a little circle where you clicked I think no?

[11-Mar-19 08:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes, but often cursor adjustments are the very last thing

@Meyse for you

[11-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Meyse#0952
Ah okay thanks? I don't see a difference though haha

[11-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Meyse#0952
Those voices are so cool

[11-Mar-19 08:25 AM] Meyse#0952
Or is the music you mean?

[11-Mar-19 08:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup

[11-Mar-19 08:25 AM] Meyse#0952
Journeyman?

[11-Mar-19 08:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
journey man and invincible for now

[11-Mar-19 08:26 AM] Meyse#0952
Awesome-o

[11-Mar-19 08:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
not really happy with it, it should feel more skyrimish, with those taunts

[11-Mar-19 08:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but cant code and compose

[11-Mar-19 08:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
at the same time

[11-Mar-19 08:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
maybe I'll compose a tune based on those two, or remix them

[11-Mar-19 08:27 AM] Meyse#0952
I can't judge until I played

[11-Mar-19 08:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[11-Mar-19 08:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

yes yes yes sweet

[11-Mar-19 10:22 AM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
AMAZING !!!

[11-Mar-19 10:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg thanks

[11-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
the sound of the voices is awesome, absolutely leave it like this  😂 👌

[11-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Regnar#6164
dude this looks great! 😄

[11-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thanks, currently fixing up the multiplayer parts

[11-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
i'm already looking forward to the result, i'll do good advertising for twitter then

[11-Mar-19 11:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, its just a demo, probably just going to finish the integration and call it a day 😃

[11-Mar-19 11:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its already overscoped

[11-Mar-19 11:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically, this project is 4 days old, and already matured above my expectations.

[11-Mar-19 11:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
It's my first RTS 😃

{Reactions}
😀 

[11-Mar-19 11:26 AM] Regnar#6164
You should continue to do RTS 😃

[11-Mar-19 11:27 AM] Regnar#6164
Those are my favorite types of games, turn-based is fun too, but not as much. I do love Civilization games though

[11-Mar-19 11:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar hahaha, I would, but setting up a kickstarter or dICO would take probably 3 months or so; I would totally love to completely finish this, but I already spend a some resources on this (too much than I should've xD xD)

[11-Mar-19 11:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Its fun, but small things eat a lot of time; and a MVP will take at least a week.

[11-Mar-19 11:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
So, just the basics and moving forward 😛 the initial idea was a simple Warcraft 2 clone; and I already have spies, killable animals, multiple units, skill trees, formation AI and all kinds of other stuff.

[11-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
you're just a perfectionist, but it's gonna pay off in the end.

[11-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Regnar#6164
Are you a freelancer Twilight or do you normally work with a team/company? I'm not sure how the game dev industry works tbh

[11-Mar-19 12:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nope I run my own things, but because of my health I am fairly limited 😃

[11-Mar-19 12:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
this stuff how ever is just personal and hobby.

[11-Mar-19 12:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
for fun 😛

[11-Mar-19 12:07 PM] Regnar#6164
Ah got ya. Glad you find it interesting! Have you messed with blockchain and crypto before?

[11-Mar-19 12:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup

[11-Mar-19 12:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Ethereum/web3

[11-Mar-19 12:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Loom, Enjin

[11-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Regnar#6164
Welcome to Komodo :D

[11-Mar-19 12:15 PM] Regnar#6164
Anything we can do to make things easier for game devs?

[11-Mar-19 12:21 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I think I already made a contribution, I integrated Unity with Komodo - and basically writing up a spec as WarChain is computing light for its API so it kinda becomes a SDK

[11-Mar-19 12:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what definitely would help are incentives, but I think they are already being made (like firing up instances in a click)

[11-Mar-19 12:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Probably, in general, video tutorials 😛

[11-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Regnar#6164
Ahh good to know. Obviously we want to make it all as easy as possible, videos I think are in the works, i know dev documents are being built out on https://developers.komodoplatform.com/  maybe we should include a section for games too including the unity stuff

good to know there are plans in the making 😛 too bad I've been here too early

[11-Mar-19 12:48 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Meanwhile, multiplayer test works

[11-Mar-19 12:51 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now its time for the beast of things, doing something actually useful with the blockchain

[11-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but first a break, I've been at it for hours straight

[11-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
haven't even had breakfast and lunch xD

Here a few short insights into the #Blockchaingaming. On board #komodo you can welcome a top developer who created this game in "a few hours" on the Komodo blockchain.

wouldn't that also be something for Komodo because gaming is also in focus???

[11-Mar-19 03:40 PM] Regnar#6164
What's the thought on dual currency in games? For example in game playing to get WAR, betting in KMD, or random treasure chest with KMD in it. I dont think there are any blockchain games with multiple currencies integrated like that, though funding it would probably have to be creative

[11-Mar-19 05:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
GDC would be this year a waste of money imo. But I personally feel that Komodo can do much more for gaming.

[11-Mar-19 05:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
💓

[11-Mar-19 05:28 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
For example, a specifc community manager for gaming or at least accelerating it; attracting devs and speak their jargon.

[11-Mar-19 05:29 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh my I got an idea!

[11-Mar-19 05:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think @Cryptofist wants to be that or create that .

[11-Mar-19 05:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ah, you're right

[11-Mar-19 05:46 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist what about that

[11-Mar-19 05:48 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse are you going tomorrow?

[11-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I've been trying to fulfil that role as much as I can now.  😉

[11-Mar-19 06:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I learned a lot on how to handle that, just from assisting and showing you around last week  @TwilightPunkster K64.

[11-Mar-19 06:10 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
❤

[11-Mar-19 06:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Also Iooked at GDC. I thought it would be too hurried to try and get something together.

There's a con here in April though that might be wonderful to attend/exhibit/sponsor

[11-Mar-19 06:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
want my personal opinion?

[11-Mar-19 06:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Those events are expensive, time robbing and rarely effective unless you spend a lot of money. Instead of doing that, take a fraction of that and do more awesome things

[11-Mar-19 06:14 PM] Meyse#0952
@TwilightPunkster K64 of course I'm going tomorrow, gonna present gambling app

[11-Mar-19 06:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ah ok, I might get my injections earlier, so if I am not entirely in agony, I might come along

[11-Mar-19 06:16 PM] Meyse#0952
Alright cool, hope you can make it

[11-Mar-19 06:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist instead of cons, do meetups with things like this (only with Ethereum/web3 xD)

[11-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Indeed. I've ran a con(horror) and attended them. They are a crapshoot for all parties.

[11-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 yep

[11-Mar-19 06:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm gaining my footing here and in my schedule, setting up some meet ups keeps crossing my mind as well as some smaller in person e deavors. 
Alot of the gaming community(as in players),
 would be interested to see this stuff.  Dropping into game shops feels beneficial to me.  (Acquiring Micro influencers)
