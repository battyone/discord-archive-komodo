[30-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Tierno#3327
On it for venture capital, and asset management and more if needed !

[30-Jun-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
always nice to solve a previously unsolved problem using simple means

[30-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@Tierno would you mind gathering what JL says need to be done and ping it here as a start point

[30-Jun-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
first step is to find a competent dev to do the breadwallet core changes

[30-Jun-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
once we get the core working, then can deal with GUI side things

[30-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Fab√ò#8941
that is what is missing in this damn world "Le bon sens"

[30-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Tierno#3327
@Fab√ò sure!

[30-Jun-19 03:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
May I suggest @dukeleto ? üòâ

[30-Jun-19 03:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or @radix42 üòâ

[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Fab√ò#8941

[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd also lean towards @miketout, but I know he's hell more busy with his project üôÇ

[30-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
would be good to find new devs, instead of overloading existing ones

[30-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a well defined task

agree with James on new devs too

[30-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
prefer to find new devs that can come into the ecosystem

[30-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Fab√ò#8941
k @grewalsatinder @radix42 is kind of busy on ARRR (we are deep on this dont pull it away üòâ

[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Fab√ò#8941
let's bring someone

[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe someone from the breadwallet community?

[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be the most efficient

[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll try finding someone from my circle if possible...

[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@grewalsatinder could you be of help here to help me write the specs

[30-Jun-19 03:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Sure!

[30-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Fab√ò#8941
```maybe someone from the breadwallet community?``` best way for sure what will be the incentive?

[30-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
a bounty?

[30-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
or for a proven dev, some short term dev contract

[30-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@grewalsatinder could you organize a talk we can talk with him about compensation package fiat and crypto

[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
him who?

[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Fab√ò#8941
```or for a proven dev, some short term dev contract``` some people (amazing one) are incentive to money üòâ they like vision

[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the dev?

[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
does breadwallet have a discord?

[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Fab√ò#8941
```someone from the breadwallet community?```

[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm going to look into breadwallet community, give me few minutes

[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@grewalsatinder

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can find where their community is and try to recruit for a short term project

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and get quotes

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] Fab√ò#8941
on it JL with @Tierno

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if it can be added to the official breadwallet, that would be the best case

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
got it, on to my research

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and worth more

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
sapling support will need a new signing method to be added

[30-Jun-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
that gets all the zcash forks added to breadwalle

[30-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Fab√ò#8941
k @grewalsatinder @Tierno  coordination is super important we need to seem very pro

üëç 

[30-Jun-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV can then be a special optimization for dPoW enabled coins

[30-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Fab√ò#8941
```that gets all the zcash forks added to breadwalle``` huge

[30-Jun-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe breadwallet company is interested to do this as an official project

[30-Jun-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be the best case actually

[30-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Fab√ò#8941
agreed

[30-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Fab√ò#8941
we need to talk to them

[30-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
that is definitely in the VC/bizdev side of things

[30-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i know they didn an ICO and have a BRD token

[30-Jun-19 03:21 PM] Fab√ò#8941
maybe eventually do the old fashion rodeo and see them in personne to put energy in

[30-Jun-19 03:21 PM] Fab√ò#8941
on it JL

[30-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810

@Fab√ò yes let‚Äôs start digging

[30-Jun-19 03:25 PM] Fab√ò#8941
now let's figure out what we exactly wants from this and evaluate it with accuracy

[30-Jun-19 03:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
these are the only 3 people who are contributors to this BreadWallet project

[30-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Fab√ò#8941
sorry @grewalsatinder

[30-Jun-19 03:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess we can also make a post in breadwallet reddit which is the only community I found so far

[30-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Fab√ò#8941
I m not a dev could you help map up with @Deleted User what exactly needs to be done in details

[30-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Fab√ò#8941
with skills set , estimate time etc....

[30-Jun-19 03:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, after making some text ready etc. of course

[30-Jun-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
changes to breadwallet core:
1. support for sapling tx signing
2. support for komodo ecosystem coins (i already did this to old breadwallet but without sapling signing)
3. support for nSPV

I estimate one to two months (at most) for the above, and that should be enough to get it so it can be part of the official breadwallet

[30-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Fab√ò#8941
ok perfect

[30-Jun-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
then, the breadwallet GUI would just work automatically with nSPV

[30-Jun-19 03:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

2. is a matter of coin parameters

[30-Jun-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
3. is making a few calls per utxo to verify them, but also would require changing the internal control flow as it must be based on syncing all the headers

[30-Jun-19 03:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c I guess the first task must be the support to add zcash/komodo transparent SPV, like porting your changes from breadwallet iOS repo to breadwallet-core, and then add nSPV, and then add Sapling signing support. making the sapling signing task first they may probably feel it's too difficult.... or may be not, but just thinking....

[30-Jun-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
sapling support lets them support ZEC and all zcash forks

[30-Jun-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
more work, but a lot more coins supported

[30-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Fab√ò#8941
this is huge

[30-Jun-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe zcash foundation can be brought into this too

[30-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Fab√ò#8941
privacy coins is the only future for this space
