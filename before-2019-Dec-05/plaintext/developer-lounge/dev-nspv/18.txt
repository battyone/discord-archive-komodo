[10-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL @SHossain before diving into multithreading (which would also force going to an opid sort of two step rpc process), i experimented with a simple caching. and it works pretty well. it is a hardforking update

[10-Jul-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the change is to issue the nspv_spend as long as the retcodes are changing or come back all 0

[10-Jul-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this uses the first nspv_spend to get most of what is needed into the cache. I have a few ideas for how to speed up addresses with small number of utxo and at that point it is still single threaded but fast enough for normal usage

[10-Jul-19 02:12 PM] TonyL#3577
First spend supposed to have same speed as before and next one faster?

[10-Jul-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Jul-19 02:33 PM] TonyL#3577
first nspv_spend `real    0m2.421s`, got retocde ```  "retcodes": [
    -2
  ]```

then without broadcast called again `real    0m2.819s`  ```  "retcodes": [
    0
  ]
```

[10-Jul-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
next calls 1.7, 2.0, 2.8, 1.7 and so on

[10-Jul-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
good and the big improvement is that it is retcode of 0, meaning fully validated, especially if you see the notarization bitmasks

[10-Jul-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
and txs broadcasting fine on my side

[10-Jul-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810

[10-Jul-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577

tx broadcasting part

[10-Jul-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you can speed up the spend even more by doing the following on login:
nspv_listunspent
for each utxo, nspv_txproof

[10-Jul-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
that will load into the cache your utxos and all the tx data

[10-Jul-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
still some calls are needed, but only a few

[10-Jul-19 03:03 PM] TonyL#3577
aha, I'm doing nspv_listunspent on login and on each refresh button click (to fetch balance)

[10-Jul-19 03:04 PM] TonyL#3577
can add nspv_txproof call for each utxo on login

[10-Jul-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
best to do it in the background if you are setup for that

[10-Jul-19 03:12 PM] TonyL#3577
threading time 😃

[10-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe just do it if there are less than 3 utxo

[10-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
then it doesnt have to be threaded. it seems fast enough as it is

[10-Jul-19 03:20 PM] TonyL#3577
it was pretty fast for 9 utxos in my wallet - set 10 utxos limit for nspv_txproof for now

have to add txfees and rewards to confrimation popup - just noticed that there is new rewards field in spend output

[10-Jul-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it shows the rewards that came in from the fullnode and a validated, which is what the local node calculates

[10-Jul-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
avoids the attack of fullnode returning 0 interest and having the reward going to miner

[10-Jul-19 03:28 PM] TonyL#3577
rewards displaying added

[11-Jul-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
10 inputs combined takes a lot of time to prepare tx

[11-Jul-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[11-Jul-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
still a little faster than syncing a fullnode

[11-Jul-19 12:18 PM] TonyL#3577

then, i sent to external address

and, a lot of prints for those 30 utxos

[11-Jul-19 12:24 PM] TonyL#3577
for 30 utxos should prepare tx for a like a minute 😃

caching raised speed on 11%

and, all utxos validated

[11-Jul-19 01:02 PM] TonyL#3577
pushed patch to wallet which allows operations with big utxos amount (before underlaying RPC lib got connection timeout almost everytime in such long calls)

```'rewards': 44980600000000, 'validated': 44980600000000``` are rewards in nspv_getinfo supposed to be displayed in satoshis? if yes - too many digits there

[11-Jul-19 01:04 PM] TonyL#3577
`0.00449806` my actual rewards

pushed fix to jl777 branch

@TonyL caching is actually speeding it up 10x

[11-Jul-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
each iteration it does more and more work as more data becomes available

[11-Jul-19 04:11 PM] TonyL#3577
hmm never notice such massive speedup on next calls after retcodes became 0, usually it's 1-2 seconds difference

[11-Jul-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is doing notarization validation when retcode 0

[11-Jul-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if other retcode, it usually skips all that

[11-Jul-19 04:22 PM] TonyL#3577
rewards indication is fixed on latest jl777 `"rewards": "0.00522367"`

i made a hardforking update. please update all nodes. in the channel purpose at top of screen are the ways to start the NSPV chain . it has low diff so you can mine a few blocks to get coins, or just use faucetget. I also set up 10 KMD nSPV fullnodes, so it has a theoretical capacity of 8000 nodes saturating it, or likely 100,000+ normal usage nodes.
main improvements are bugfixes, 99% chance to get final rpc result on the first call, and initial CC support. so far faucet is working, along with a few of tokens calls, but havent been able to test a lot yet. each CC rpc is able to use any info in the daemon, and if it uses any but the most standard, it will need to be updated. no idea what percentage of calls this is. shossain has started testing and results from yesterdays version is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c4FHg33phx2u3ko8Pg8SamA7jBllwzY-_QCCF91PX4k/edit#gid=1636254260

there is also the ILN chain if you want to test notarization validation

[13-Jul-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
nodes are 5.9.102.210, 5.9.253.195 to 5.9.253.203 you can addnode to all of those to get the most fullnodes and highest throughput

[13-Jul-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
latest version supports nspv_listtransactions

[13-Jul-19 01:42 PM] SHossain#0007
did anyone notice yet that CC works with nSPV? 😉
