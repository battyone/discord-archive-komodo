yes, you can see listunspent of any address

[05-Aug-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so why not default to the most recent logged in address?

[05-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Sir Seven#7158
I just expected to see error if no user is actually logged in.
There is no problem in this case.

@jl777c 
```bash
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getpeerinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$port/
```

```json
  {
    "nodeid": 1,
    "protocolversion": 2,
    "ipaddress": "5.9.253.195",
    "port": 7770,
    "lastping": 1565175111,
    "time_started_con": 1565174366,
    "time_last_request": 1565175123,
    "services": 0,
    "missbehavescore": 0,
    "bestknownheight": 1476663,
    "in_sync": "not_synced"
  }
```
what is `"services": 0,` and ` "in_sync": "not_synced"` this node has the same bestknownheight as other nodes that don't have the "in_sync" property

[07-Aug-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
not_synced is based on the info it sent back, maybe it is lagging a bit?

[07-Aug-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
services 0 means its not an nSPV fullnode, which seems wrong

[07-Aug-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
does it remain a peer?

[07-Aug-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
with services 0, it seems it wont respond as a valid nSPV fullnode, which would not allow it to achieve in_sync status

[07-Aug-19 11:01 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c 
this is the whole output
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/PX3fvWQgfc/
all nodes have services: 0
all have same bestknownheight
only 2 have "in_sync": "not_synced"

[07-Aug-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
plz ask @blackjok3r that was his update

[07-Aug-19 11:02 AM] gcharang#6833
will do

[07-Aug-19 01:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
With nSPV all dPOW coins can be "lite" sent... can it be used on BTC itself?

[07-Aug-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it needs to be a komodo based coin AND with dPoW, both

[07-Aug-19 01:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
so there is no way the Bitcoin SPV mode in AGAMA will ever work with nSPV?

[07-Aug-19 01:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
its on the wrong end of the validation notarizations?

[07-Aug-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i am 100% sure BTC legacy devs will reject any PR to add the nSPV functionality into the bitcoind

[07-Aug-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we could make our own custom bitcoind with nSPV support as it isnt a consensus change, but really i dont feel like doing that. just too much work to help make a legacy coin have more tech. probably would make BTC price plummet

[07-Aug-19 01:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
HAHAHA

[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh man i wasnt expecting that last part

[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
but i was thinking the same thing... bitcoind could be slightly modified so KMD had its own nSPV capable BTC nodes

[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a "slight" modification

[08-Aug-19 02:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
services I think is reading the wrong variable, I will fix it. Synced means that it has the block header from that node for the chain tip and it links back to the last notarization.After its been running a while all nodes should be synced to the same block.

also we just achieved the first web wallet broadcast. still it is very rough and many fields are not being generated but it should be simple to use and able to create and broadcast valid tx

[11-Aug-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
@allbits maybe you might want to try it. just start nspv and then go to browser http://127.0.0.1:<rpcport>

[11-Aug-19 06:18 PM] allbits#5898
K. Will do later today. Thanks. I'll have to remember how to update my nspv haha

[11-Aug-19 06:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
git pull
make

[11-Aug-19 06:27 PM] allbits#5898
Yeah. Thanks üòÄ

[11-Aug-19 06:27 PM] allbits#5898
How do I check what branch I'm in. I haven't updated in a while

[11-Aug-19 06:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
git branch

[11-Aug-19 06:47 PM] allbits#5898
Thanks

[11-Aug-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
in the jl777 branch

[11-Aug-19 07:32 PM] allbits#5898
Was just going to ask that!

[11-Aug-19 08:19 PM] allbits#5898
Am I doing libnspv?

[11-Aug-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[11-Aug-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
just like when you did the cli testing, just can use the browser now

[11-Aug-19 08:22 PM] allbits#5898
Updated. I did ./nspv. What rpc port in the browser?

[11-Aug-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
what coin

[11-Aug-19 08:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
-port= work?

[11-Aug-19 08:23 PM] allbits#5898
I just did ./nspv without surviving anything else

[11-Aug-19 08:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then it will be 7771

[11-Aug-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
then it is KMD, port 7771

[11-Aug-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
-port should work

[11-Aug-19 08:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
-port seems like a good idea so all coins are the same port

[11-Aug-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[11-Aug-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
each nspv is a separate process

[11-Aug-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
only one can bind any specific rpc port

[11-Aug-19 08:24 PM] allbits#5898
I get error: no method returned in the browser

[11-Aug-19 08:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. But to test, just set port so all scripts will just work, with alll coins

[11-Aug-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
http://127.0.0.1:7771

[11-Aug-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you are right, seems i just broken it

[11-Aug-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
no it works

[11-Aug-19 08:25 PM] allbits#5898
Ok

[11-Aug-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i am just not running it for KMD

[11-Aug-19 08:26 PM] allbits#5898
I get error: no method

[11-Aug-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
./nspv ILN

[11-Aug-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
try ILN

[11-Aug-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it is port 12986

[11-Aug-19 08:27 PM] allbits#5898
Same result

[11-Aug-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
does cli respond?

[11-Aug-19 08:28 PM] allbits#5898
Cli output seems normal. What kind of commands can I test on cli

[11-Aug-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing has changed on cli

[11-Aug-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
try http://127.0.0.1:12986/method/getinfo

[11-Aug-19 08:31 PM] allbits#5898
Oooh that worked! Looks pretty

[11-Aug-19 08:31 PM] allbits#5898
Except for my ILN balance

[11-Aug-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
you can try with KMD now it works

[11-Aug-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but only test amounts

[11-Aug-19 08:33 PM] allbits#5898
There it is!

[11-Aug-19 08:53 PM] allbits#5898
So I generated new address, logged in, received funds. Then tested send but sent full amount (without accounting for fee). This created a crash when I tried to broadcast the transaction. There was also lots of unformed data on that broadcast page - variable names instead of numbers

[11-Aug-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
try sending a bit less

[11-Aug-19 08:57 PM] allbits#5898
Tried sending less and it aborted when I hit send transaction (the step before broadcast)

[11-Aug-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
update to latest, i just fixed some bugs

[11-Aug-19 08:57 PM] allbits#5898
K

[11-Aug-19 08:59 PM] allbits#5898
Success!

[11-Aug-19 09:02 PM] allbits#5898
Funds received ok. But nspv wallet not updating - not showing updated balance or the transaction in the transaction history

[11-Aug-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
this has no javascript

[11-Aug-19 09:02 PM] allbits#5898
I hit refresh but it doesn't update

[11-Aug-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, seems it is in the cache. if you logout and login again is the balance ok?

[11-Aug-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
look at ILN, it shows what fields are needed

[11-Aug-19 09:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

[11-Aug-19 09:03 PM] allbits#5898

[11-Aug-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810

Yes.

@grewalsatinder latest has the vin/vout working. but for vin we need to remove the amount field
