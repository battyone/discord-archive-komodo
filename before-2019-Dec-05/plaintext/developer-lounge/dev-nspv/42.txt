Spotted this which reminded me of nspv in a way.
`To speed things up, the researchers give each new certificate verification information based on a block a few hundred or 1,000 blocks behind it ‚Äî called a ‚Äúbreadcrumb.‚Äù When a new user joins, they match the breadcrumb of an early block to a breadcrumb 1,000 blocks ahead. That breadcrumb can be matched to another breadcrumb 1,000 blocks ahead, and so on.`

i remember dealing with this when using chromebooks. You have to do something special to allow ssh'ing from the container and the main OS

[13-Aug-19 04:37 PM] allbits#5898
I enabled that flag. Still no success

@allbits you might need to restart browser after changing that

[13-Aug-19 04:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
This is a security "feature"

[13-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven the latest jl777 might support the update button for showing mempool tx, you need to send and get something in mempool first. amount will show as 0, but txid should appear properly and maybe you can click it and see if it returns valid data

[13-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also fixed the 38 vin crash

[13-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
at least i found a buffer that was too small

worked, as in it displayed the pages?

[13-Aug-19 05:42 PM] allbits#5898
Yes

[13-Aug-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so the problem is just with the chrome

[13-Aug-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
did it work without the -x=ipaddr parameter?

[13-Aug-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it could be a workaround for chromebooks

[13-Aug-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder if anybody can build for android

[13-Aug-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
or windows

[13-Aug-19 05:47 PM] allbits#5898
Yes it works without -x=ipaddr parameter in lynx

[13-Aug-19 05:47 PM] allbits#5898
Lynx is cli only tho

[13-Aug-19 05:47 PM] allbits#5898
Doesn't work with brave

W3m
w3m is a free software/open source text-based web browser and terminal pager. It has support for tables, frames, SSL connections, color and inline images on suitable terminals. Generally, it renders pages in a form as true to their original layout as possible.

the html and coins files bloated the HDD footprint to 1.5MB

[13-Aug-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i think RAM footprint is still around 3MB (mega not giga), but it needs to be measured again

[13-Aug-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
works in 32bit CPU

[13-Aug-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe even 16 bit microcontrollers if it has a decent c compiler

[13-Aug-19 07:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i think i just found the first potential external collaboration for superlite/nSPV

[13-Aug-19 07:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am working on integrating Hush into OpenBazaar, and they are not so excited to run ZEC full nodes nor HUSH full nodes

[13-Aug-19 07:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then I thought, "shit, they can use superlite wallets in their own API"

[13-Aug-19 07:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am in a private slack room working with their devs

[13-Aug-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, you can just use curl to issue rpc requests

[13-Aug-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the html is just invoking the same internal functions

[13-Aug-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
but ZEC probably wont work as they dont have all the downstream changes we made that is needed to support nSPV

[13-Aug-19 07:47 PM] CMaurice#1685
getting lots of: ```nServices.5 disconnect from node 11: /MagicBean:2.0.15-rc2/ (1485781)
Disconnect node 11```

[13-Aug-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, only fullnodes running dev branch (or below) support nSPV

[13-Aug-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
other peers will be disconnected from

[13-Aug-19 07:48 PM] CMaurice#1685
yep, seems to be working fine

[13-Aug-19 07:49 PM] jorian#4555
maybe i'm node 11? i'm not running a full node but have a nspv lite wallet open

[13-Aug-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
superlites dont register as a relaying node, so the fullnodes shouldnt bother with them

[13-Aug-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems many are trying out the nspv, but not many complaints of bugs. is it just working?

[13-Aug-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
we still need to verify it works on windows and android

[13-Aug-19 08:08 PM] allbits#5898
I'm on android - termux but having problems with dependencies

[13-Aug-19 08:09 PM] allbits#5898
"unable to locate package" for many of them

[13-Aug-19 08:12 PM] allbits#5898
I'm also trying to figure out why I'm getting "unable to locate package" for libevent-dev in popos but wasn't getting that result in ubuntu

[13-Aug-19 08:21 PM] CMaurice#1685
the required packages don't seem to be in unstable-packages either, you'd need to compile or cross-compile them I think

[13-Aug-19 08:25 PM] CMaurice#1685
appears they have libsodium for libsodium-dev (https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/packages/libsodium/build.sh) dunno about others

[13-Aug-19 08:26 PM] CMaurice#1685
so I started nspv with -x=IPofMachine, but was unable to connect to it from another machine on the local network, other servers working fine

[13-Aug-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
curl doesnt work?

[13-Aug-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i never actually verified remote works, probably should

[13-Aug-19 08:34 PM] CMaurice#1685
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer

[13-Aug-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will look into this later this week

[13-Aug-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you are setting -x=<ip of other machine>

[13-Aug-19 08:47 PM] CMaurice#1685
nope, IPofThisMachine

[13-Aug-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the one you are doing the curl from

[13-Aug-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
no, -x needs to be the ip address of the external machine

[13-Aug-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so only a single external node is allowed access

[13-Aug-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
can you see if that works

[13-Aug-19 08:48 PM] CMaurice#1685
I see, checking

[13-Aug-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no point to allow random nodes to connect, as the other nodes can just run an nspv themselves

[13-Aug-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so just special situations like for docker or chromebook

[13-Aug-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
where you end up not having a working 127.0.0.1

[13-Aug-19 08:51 PM] CMaurice#1685
ok, nspv errors out with external ip anyway

[13-Aug-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, will need to investigate

[13-Aug-19 09:23 PM] allbits#5898
Possible html error?: I decided to run nspv on a system where komodod already running. So I used the -p option, selecting port 5000.  In the browser, the first page came up fine. Then when logging in I come to a blank page - this seems to be because the link takes me to 127.0.01:7771 instead of 127.0.0.1:5000

[13-Aug-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this seems a bug

[13-Aug-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
will fix tomorrow

[13-Aug-19 10:06 PM] CMaurice#1685 (pinned)
to build on termux:

pkg upgrade && pkg install build-essential git wget libsodium libevent

there may be other packages required as I have used termux to build before

git clone https://github.com/jl777/libnspv/
cd libnspv

I did execute:

find . -name 'config.sub' -exec chmod u+w '{}' \; -exec cp -f "${PREFIX}/share/libtool/build-aux/config.sub" '{}' \;
find . -name 'config.guess' -exec chmod u+w '{}' \; -exec cp -f "${PREFIX}/share/libtool/build-aux/config.guess" '{}' \;

(from https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Building_packages). Probably necessary, anyway...
it's the same: 

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

wait a bit then ./nspv

then just visit 127.0.0.1:7771
