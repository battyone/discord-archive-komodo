but not very friendly from a user api basis

[25-Jul-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
notarizations is a good api call to make to find the right hash to use

[25-Jul-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if that is needed

[25-Jul-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810

I think we should move teh fetch of the headers to a seperate API in the daemon. This should make it reasonably easy.

[25-Jul-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently it only fetches between 2 notarizations so if you cant scan forwards because it doesnt exist yet. So the notarizations should just be returned then those 2 heights used to call a function for headers

[25-Jul-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That may change a bit much stuff though ü§î

[25-Jul-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
getinfo has an optional hdrheight parameter

[25-Jul-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you can query for individual header

[25-Jul-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
why not use that?

[25-Jul-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it is actually more efficient to do 10 smaller tx than one big one, due to packet switching characteristics

[25-Jul-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i think a single getinfo might actually fit into a single tcp/ip packet, but not sure

[25-Jul-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IUt will use lots of nodes aswell and spread it around

[25-Jul-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is better to request headers one at a time

[25-Jul-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its constantly getting sent them by all nodes. So really in not much time of being online it has almost enough headers received, just doesnt save them anywhere

[25-Jul-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Should be enough to just check the previous header and save them back to he last notarizatrion

[25-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, just storing the most recent 100 headers will be enough in 99.9% of cases

[25-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
just rotate the buffer and request any that are missing

[25-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
any new block should just connect right up to the chain tip to become the new chaintip

[25-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
in case of reorg, then might need to wait for notarization to resolve things, as longest chain will be fighting each other until we get a notarization

[25-Jul-19 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm yes, it currently wouldnt go backwards lol

[25-Jul-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is quite primitive

[25-Jul-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean as long as the chain is still moving, it would eventually be ok...

[25-Jul-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess maybe reorg handling would be good, ie. if a longer chain comes in, then need to request the missing headers until it connects to the notarized chain

[25-Jul-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but yes the  headers it has would then be wrong. and need to be checked

[25-Jul-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i think that is all that needs to be done. so if a new longer chain arrives that doesnt connect, then query the prior heights to fill in the missing headers

[25-Jul-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
or can rely on reorgs being rare enough, to just clear the entire cache if it is detected

[25-Jul-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
then scanning back to the notarization will automatically fill it with the valid headers

[25-Jul-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That might be a lot easier, not that the chain tip is that imporant, most utxos are actually notarised

In browser "cant find index.html" should I put it to the same dir with binary?

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it needs to be run from ~/libnspv

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
on windows PC have only binary - will test a little bit later

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
but curl calls works

[25-Jul-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to make html dir with those files

[25-Jul-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
can do the same browser test in unix

[25-Jul-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt work yet, so dont get too excited

[25-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but it looks pretty good on osx

[25-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but if windows can do spend, that means we are already cross platform

[25-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
for installing, all that is needed is to launch the executable and open the browser to the 127.0.0.1 page

[25-Jul-19 05:10 PM] TonyL#3577

on unix it looks cool

yes,the same for osx

seems windows is the blacksheep again

[25-Jul-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
what browser did you use in windows?

[25-Jul-19 05:16 PM] TonyL#3577
chrome

[25-Jul-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is browser specific

[25-Jul-19 05:17 PM] TonyL#3577
and chrome on unix too

[25-Jul-19 05:17 PM] TonyL#3577
maybe something is on my side, checking

[25-Jul-19 05:20 PM] TonyL#3577
it seems like a pathes windows specific issue

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] TonyL#3577
on windows it showing this not pretty html only when html page files and binary locating in same directory

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is finding the index.html

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so it should be finding the .css file too

[25-Jul-19 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
yes, thats strange

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
a mystery for some windows browser familiar person to help fix

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you try 127.0.0.1:7771/bootstrap.min.css

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it should direcly load the css file

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
unix vs win would show if it is a file not found issue or something else

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] TonyL#3577
http://127.0.0.1:7771/bootstrap.min.css returns ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE so it's on server (nspv binary) side I wonder

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] TonyL#3577
but no prints in nspv console

http://127.0.0.1:7771/bootstrap.min.css  should just return a bunch of html

[25-Jul-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
not graphics

[25-Jul-19 05:33 PM] TonyL#3577
