if you just use the html wallet, you can see a simple wallet in action

[13-Nov-19 09:52 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok great

[13-Nov-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that has screenshots of the html gui

[13-Nov-19 09:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Ideally here are the steps I'm trying to follow:

The user starts his game with his own blockchain (create with the antara composer for example) He has setup his coin file and is now ready to spawn a new instance of nSPV directly from his game on his new blockchain. Once it's done, nSPV connects to the node of its blockchain, so far no problem. The idea is that the first time I start the game I will use the call rpc getnewaddress to create the portfolio of the player if I followed well. But the next time I log in I want to use my wallet with the address I just created. (so i use the login rpc call with the `wif` or the `seed` and there i'm ready to do anything i need

[13-Nov-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[13-Nov-19 09:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Perfect. so far.

[13-Nov-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
management of the actual seed/wif is left to the caller/user

[13-Nov-19 09:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah that's what i'm thinking about i should not save the seed/wif

[13-Nov-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont, then how will the user remember?

[13-Nov-19 09:54 AM] Slyris#2880
I should save it, but i need to think about exposing different solution to the user

[13-Nov-19 09:54 AM] Slyris#2880
just the save the seed into a file seem's dangerous no ?

[13-Nov-19 09:55 AM] Slyris#2880
I mean in terms of security, it's up to the user i guess.

[13-Nov-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe if it is encrypted with a password/pin

[13-Nov-19 09:55 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i should ask for a password or smth like that

[13-Nov-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
then some AES encrypted blob to store the seed locally

[13-Nov-19 09:55 AM] Slyris#2880
I guess it's exactly what is done in the AtomicDex

[13-Nov-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and the user could also copy down the seed

[13-Nov-19 09:55 AM] Slyris#2880
They store the seed that is accessible through a pin

[13-Nov-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[13-Nov-19 09:56 AM] Slyris#2880
I will follow the same approach so.

[13-Nov-19 09:57 AM] Slyris#2880
Thank's for the clarification it's more clear now.

[13-Nov-19 09:57 AM] Slyris#2880
I guess that i have one seed / coin too

[13-Nov-19 09:57 AM] Slyris#2880
So i should probably ask only one pin for every seed

[13-Nov-19 09:58 AM] Slyris#2880
If the user in his game spawn an nSPV instance with KMD, one with RICK and create an address on both of them i will need to save both seed/wif (encrypted way) but ideally with an unique pin.

[13-Nov-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use the same seed/wif for all coins

[13-Nov-19 09:59 AM] Slyris#2880
So i create one the first time, and if the seed exist, use login instead of getnewaddress

[13-Nov-19 09:59 AM] Slyris#2880
for other coins.

[13-Nov-19 10:00 AM] Slyris#2880
first time game launch -> spawn instance -> create address only once -> use login for every other call once i have the seed.

[13-Nov-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
makes sense. keep in mind the login lasts 777 seconds, after that the privkey is erased from memory

[13-Nov-19 10:01 AM] Slyris#2880
Means after login i should use the rpc calls for getting history stuff, etc and save it

[13-Nov-19 10:01 AM] Slyris#2880
And if the user want a refresh need to login again etc

[13-Nov-19 10:02 AM] Slyris#2880
I can i think run a dedicated thread for that, that login every 777 seconds and refresh information that the user need's.

[13-Nov-19 10:03 AM] Slyris#2880
If i understand correctly after a `login` rpc call, `logout` is automatically called after 777 seconds of activity.

[13-Nov-19 10:07 AM] Slyris#2880
Now i think about a real world usage let's say

I'm in a rpg video games, and i have golds (which is my coins) let's say i have 2000 RICK in game

I want to spend 1000, i will use `spent + broadcast` so i need to be `logged` here there is 2 solutions:

- Ask the pin at the moment where the user whant to buy something in game
- After the user logged in the game and enter his pin (once)  i automatically call `login` rpc call for him every 777 seconds for the session and don't ask pin anymore in game.

What we will prefer here ? Should we let the choice to the user to configure this behavior ?

[13-Nov-19 10:08 AM] Slyris#2880
I guess that's will be boring to type our pin each time we want to buy something, so we can save the pin for one game session let's say.

[13-Nov-19 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Pin asking on every blockchain tx should be very annoying for user

[13-Nov-19 10:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah so what i'm suggesting is to have a login scene with a create wallet button that will ask user the pin that he want to create for his game blabla

[13-Nov-19 10:10 AM] Slyris#2880
and a login button where you just type your pin

[13-Nov-19 10:10 AM] Slyris#2880
When we leave the game we expire the pin for the session.

[13-Nov-19 10:10 AM] Slyris#2880
something like that

[13-Nov-19 10:11 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, decryption once on login into the game sounds good

[13-Nov-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
also, you can do almost everything without being logged in

[13-Nov-19 10:11 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe you can just make nspv without expiration

[13-Nov-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
only signing the tx needs to be logged in

[13-Nov-19 10:12 AM] TonyL#3577
as an option so it'll be the same - one login call and then usage until logout call

[13-Nov-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
modifying the 777 autologout to 7777777 seconds is a matter of changing one define

[13-Nov-19 10:12 AM] Slyris#2880
If it's possible to add it as the command line parameters or in the nspv config that can be great

[13-Nov-19 10:13 AM] Slyris#2880
But in fact if for buyings any stuffs that i want i type my pin for 777 seconds, it's should be enough to shop everything that i need

[13-Nov-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just dangerous to have a funded privkey in memory forever

[13-Nov-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
putting in the pin whenever transacting doesnt seem like too much burden

[13-Nov-19 10:14 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah

[13-Nov-19 10:14 AM] TonyL#3577
`But in fact if for buyings any stuffs that i want i type my pin for 777 seconds, it's should be enough to shop everything that i need` but in future keystrokes you'll need to send permanently I wonder

[13-Nov-19 10:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Anyway this is just configuration stuff issue i guess we can change it at any moment

[13-Nov-19 10:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Best things to do it's to expose different possibility to the user and let him pick the best choice

[13-Nov-19 10:16 AM] Slyris#2880
If i want to type my pin every time i buy something.
If i want to type my pin only once. etc

[13-Nov-19 10:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Everyone is different i guess

[13-Nov-19 10:16 AM] Slyris#2880
it's mater of taste mostly.

[13-Nov-19 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
It might be different for different games also

[13-Nov-19 10:16 AM] Slyris#2880
But we need to tell to the user to be aware of the different level of security solution that we expose to him.

[13-Nov-19 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
In FPS I'll need to record results once per round, if we trade some NFT we'll need to broadcast txs and etc

[13-Nov-19 10:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but let's say you are in a mmorpg

[13-Nov-19 10:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Have a priv key in memory that doesn't expire

[13-Nov-19 10:17 AM] Slyris#2880
it's really dangerous

[13-Nov-19 10:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Especially on windows, detect the nSPV process and just put a watcher in real time to it

[13-Nov-19 10:18 AM] Slyris#2880
you will get the seed really easy.

[13-Nov-19 10:19 AM] Slyris#2880
You can easily sniff a packet of a mmorpg to know when a player is trying to buy something and at that moment to monitor the process nspv to try to get the seed, it's crooked, but I think it's really simple to make

[13-Nov-19 10:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Since if you know that the call `login` arrives when a user try to buy something at that moment the seed is exposed

[13-Nov-19 10:21 AM] Slyris#2880
After that, it's also up to the user to pay attention to the software that hangs on his computer, but it's becoming more and more common

[13-Nov-19 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
With current design you'll have the seed as the plain text on some point anyway

[13-Nov-19 10:21 AM] gcharang#6833
>  sniff a packet of a mmorpg
this is in the internet, correct?

nSPV communication happens locally

[13-Nov-19 10:22 AM] Slyris#2880
But hey you take the case of a lambda user who just want to download the new mod of the game he likes, and behind you have an app that monitors nspv behind, it's not terrible

[13-Nov-19 10:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah @gcharang I speak locally

[13-Nov-19 10:22 AM] Slyris#2880
I mean locally you can sniff the packet from localhost if you have a software that try to spy

[13-Nov-19 10:22 AM] gcharang#6833
oh, you mean the local system is already compromised?

[13-Nov-19 10:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Yup

Let's say you want to download a MOD's

[13-Nov-19 10:23 AM] Slyris#2880
in this mod's there is a spy software that's hook the nspv process

[13-Nov-19 10:23 AM] Slyris#2880
we are instantly fucked.

[13-Nov-19 10:23 AM] Slyris#2880
It's the user fault of course

[13-Nov-19 10:24 AM] gcharang#6833
got it, so even if it is a mod, the user should install from a trusted open source repo

[13-Nov-19 10:24 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah ofc, but every day's people try to download external stuff for their games

[13-Nov-19 10:24 AM] Slyris#2880
we cannot control

[13-Nov-19 10:25 AM] Slyris#2880

[13-Nov-19 10:31 AM] Slyris#2880
so here what I'm going to do is for the moment exposed a member function in my system nspv which allows to `encrypt / decrypt` a `wif` stored locally to use the login function. Later we will see where and how, and in which context we will use these two functions.

[13-Nov-19 10:33 AM] Slyris#2880
It would seem all the same that we have to look into the possible vulnerabilities of our solution (the private key has a time exposed) that does not necessarily happen on other game, because they are centralized and that finally the information is stored in a database that is not local.

[13-Nov-19 10:34 AM] Slyris#2880
The first idea that comes to my mind is to ban the external hooks on the process directly from the nSPV binary, I know it's possible I did it in the past. (but only on Windows)

[13-Nov-19 10:37 AM] Slyris#2880
But stackoverflow disagree with me

[13-Nov-19 10:39 AM] Slyris#2880
I want to say that it's just part of the pros and cons, and the user should just pay attention, as we try to pay attention to our private keys

[13-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Slyris#2880
I love the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhaving a decentralized online game, but that means that the user must be ultra serious and attentive to the environment in which he launches the game.

[13-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Slyris#2880
I guess some of the solution just launches their games in a sandbox that's untouchable and impenetrable

[13-Nov-19 10:56 AM] Slyris#2880
such as : https://itch.io/docs/itch/using/sandbox.html

Seem's to be really interesting.

@jl777c   `pushed fix to all branches other than master. after it is confirmed to be working, i will update master`
Checked with cli and html wallet. Works fine. Autotests passed.
If I got it right - problem was with too much vins to transaction. Currently huge amounts of vins do not crash nspv process.

[13-Nov-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, before if you had more than 80 utxos it crashed. that address had 81!

That was a jackpot to buypass 80 limitation with exactly 81 üòÇ

[13-Nov-19 03:03 PM] TonyL#3577
btw @Sir Seven is it some address in auto-tests? If you're using same address on real chain it's better to merge utxos into single one on each tests execution - otherwise each other test will be started with different conditions to previous one
