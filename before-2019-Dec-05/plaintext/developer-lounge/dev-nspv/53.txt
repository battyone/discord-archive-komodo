Yep, keeps on crashing after pull.

[26-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are multiple issues... probably isnt something I can fix in 5 mins...

[26-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try though

[26-Aug-19 04:49 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Small issues with html wallet and localization:
1. Probably a typo with NOTARI_TXID_HEIGHT:

-etc

[26-Aug-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
1. as long as it is consistently uses the exact $variable name is not so important

[26-Aug-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
2. not sure what you mean

[26-Aug-19 07:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Sir Seven renamed NOTARI_TXID_HEIGHT to NOTARI_TX_ID_HEIGHT in language json

[26-Aug-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand

[26-Aug-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
why is it changed?

[26-Aug-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
NOTARY_TXID_HEIGHT might make a bit more sense, but like i wrote above, there is no need to do this.

[26-Aug-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r it seems much better, but the bandwidth usage is probably a bit too high. also, it doesnt update the "In Sync" column on the peers page, i was thinking that would be for validated height for a node

[26-Aug-19 07:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  will fix tomorrow. Yes bandwidth can be reduced further... just trying to work out the best way to do it still. Liekly what I have will work with some diffrent numbers.

[26-Aug-19 07:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
```{ "NOTARI_TXID": "Notarized Txid" },
            { "NOTARI_TXID_HEIGHT": "Notarization Txid Height" },```

[26-Aug-19 07:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so instead of showing "Notarization Destination Txid" the page is now showing "Notarized Txid_HEIGHT"

[26-Aug-19 07:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c what you want me to do to fix it?

[26-Aug-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the bug we are trying to fix?

[26-Aug-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt it work now?

[26-Aug-19 07:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so instead of showing "Notarization Destination Txid" the page is now showing "Notarized Txid_HEIGHT"

[26-Aug-19 07:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nope

[26-Aug-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what should it display?

[26-Aug-19 07:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Notarization Txid Height

[26-Aug-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
how does changing $NOTARI_TXID_HEIGHT -> $NOTARI_TX_ID_HEIGHT fix it?

[26-Aug-19 07:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's without Underscore and the whole word "HEIGHT" is not upper case, just the "H" letter of the word "Height" is uppercase.

[26-Aug-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i understand that, but your pull request only changed the variable name

[26-Aug-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
which doesnt affect what is displayed

[26-Aug-19 07:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
"NOTARI_TXID" json key was conflicting with "NOTARI_TXID_HEIGHT" json key.

[26-Aug-19 07:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
putting "NOTARI_TXID"'s value for "NOTARI_TXID_HEIGHT" and just printing "_HEIGHT".

[26-Aug-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
to fix that, put the longer variable name first

[26-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
in the english.json file

[26-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
put the NOTARI_TXID_HEIGHT before NOTARI_TXID

[26-Aug-19 07:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, let me try

[26-Aug-19 07:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes that worked!

@jl777c @siu - Chainmakers @gcharang @dukeleto Hey guys, would you be kind to summarize what stuff needs to be fixed or refactored for CC in nSPV mode so I don't have to look too much in history of the channel?

[27-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
everything

[27-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no CC support at all right now

[27-Aug-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
there is libcryptoconditions linked in and ready to be used

Ah ok, I meant as you mentioned me on several things last two weeks just to have them on one place. Never mind, I'm on some CCnSPV stuff that I started and will check every CC (one by one) if it works and what needs to be done

[27-Aug-19 11:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I tried a couple of calls a week or so ago but nothing really worked

[27-Aug-19 11:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Some got stuck, others responded empty output

[27-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Mihailo#5902
I first fixed the CC calls on CCs I worked on as I know them the best. So you could try channels,gateways,oracles...

[27-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Mihailo#5902
They should be working, except the [cc]list rpc as I'm working on that now.

I had to use valgrind on it... Wasnt a simple process... Bit seems to now be ok. Ive been sitting here just fetching txproofs for ages now and its not crashing. Still need to reduce bandwidth a bit more, but crash was more imporant.

[27-Aug-19 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r elite points for valgrind usage

[27-Aug-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its easy a pie on nSPV

[27-Aug-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are no mem leaks

[27-Aug-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or there is no longer any

[27-Aug-19 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
best time to run valgrind is on new codebases

[27-Aug-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There were a bunch of calloc that were not setting enough buffer...

[27-Aug-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it over ran and corruped the heap.

[27-Aug-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is why Rust exists

@jl777c Why do nSPV node need sometime before it start working? Even normal nodes need some time before they relay transactions to each other. I noticed that like half a year ago it was better - it started relaying txs very soon from start but at some point it got longer. When I start superlite nspv node it needs few minutes before it can receive response from full node.
