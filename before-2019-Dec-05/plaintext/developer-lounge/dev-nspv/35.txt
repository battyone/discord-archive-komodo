therefore it might actually be better to have a special new dapp multinspv, that launches the various single threaded nspv and just makes api requests to each of them

{Reactions}
🔥 

[30-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be a bit less efficient as api calls would be needed for each interaction, but i dont forsee there needing to be thousands of interactions per second

[30-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this will be much simpler. making nspv handle multicoins per instance will make it have to deal with mutex issues

[30-Jul-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
though the only internally generated event now is the getinfo call, so maybe it isnt so bad, but as it grows, maybe we put more in the NSPV_periodic and each additional thing that is done is potentially in a race condition with the multicoin logic

[30-Jul-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the multinspv of course should be multithreaded

[30-Jul-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
but like iguana it is just talking to the existing daemons

[30-Jul-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So for more coins you want to launch a new process?

[30-Jul-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
why not? a 3MB footprint is no big deal

[30-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
its not like it has a 3GB footprint

[30-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
being so small, what makes no sense normally starts making sense

[30-Jul-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes doesn't seem a problem, I actually thought of that myself, just have it luanhc a new nspv instance for the coin it needs to connect to andd wait until it sends the response

[30-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to recalculate all the reasons for most everything

[30-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
usually you dont want to spawn a new executable due to its overhead

[30-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but if the overhead is 3MB, you can spawn 100 of them, literally and be the same as a single komodod footprint

[30-Jul-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the name of the smallest lizard, like a microscopic one

[30-Jul-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For the multichain stuff though, if an import tx happens all nodes will need to connect to the other chain to verify the proof

[30-Jul-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have geckos? And skinks?

[30-Jul-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Skinks are tiny

[30-Jul-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
In 2001, scientists discovered a tiny lizard on a tiny island off the coast of the Dominican Republic. The Jaragua lizard measures about three quarters of an inch in length, or 16 millimeters, from the tip of his snout to the base of his tail. To get a good idea of just how small this fellow is, picture a dime with the lizard curled up around its perimeter.

[30-Jul-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean all nodes?

[30-Jul-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wait sorry, no the proof is part of the import and linked back to notaries. Sorry

[30-Jul-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i imagine that to do a crosschain, you need to spawn the two chains (if they are not already running)

[30-Jul-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
do what you need to do on each chain to issue and validate it is all happy

[30-Jul-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
then can even disconnect from the originating chain

[30-Jul-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I figured it would work the same, but would not all nodes who need to verify that tx need tondo the same?

[30-Jul-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
all the fullnodes would be doing the validating

[30-Jul-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it gets mined

[30-Jul-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
notarized

[30-Jul-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
then nspv can verify it is notarized

[30-Jul-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
why would all nspv nodes have to do anything about some random other nodes crosschain tx?

[30-Jul-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
nspv nodes only care about a single address at a time

[30-Jul-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No I was meaning for full nodes

[30-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if the nspv is making a valid tx, what is the problem?

[30-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
when nspv makes a tx and broadcasts it, all fullnodes validate it

[30-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
how is a crosschain CC tx any different?

[30-Jul-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK so full node just uses momom?

[30-Jul-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
nspv can get the notarization tx right?

[30-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
that notarization tx has MoMoM data

[30-Jul-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If u can find it

[30-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
we might need a bit of fullnode help to achieve this

[30-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
adding a new p2p message is not hard, just a lot of places to add things to

[30-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
or we could use the baggage claim path, which might be less work and possible without any extra fullnode support

[30-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the power of nspv is that given a txid, we can prove it happened

[30-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
which means we can prove the burn happened

[30-Jul-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That path requires a proof from x notaries

[30-Jul-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[30-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
ah, forgot that detail...

[30-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
ok so what is needed to use MoMoM for this case

[30-Jul-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Any node can prove, a tx happened on another chain as long as they can spawn an nspv and validate it

[30-Jul-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
what is required to create a valid import?

[30-Jul-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems the harder half

[30-Jul-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Momom will do it, as long as the node that creates the tx gives a momom hash that exists on the target

[30-Jul-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
or given a valid burn and a properly constructed import, will the fullnodes automatically be able to validate it as it is

[30-Jul-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
nspv nodes can get momom hashes from the notarizations, it is in the opreturn. so the opreturn parsing needs to expand to extract the momom data

[30-Jul-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
are all the pieces there already do to a momom cross chain?

[30-Jul-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I think I got it. Right now a successful momom transfer needs kmd node to get the momom and add it to the import tx, it keeps trying this until it gets the right hash, nspv has less work to do there

[30-Jul-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, maybe txproof request can also return whatever missing momom data needed

[30-Jul-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[30-Jul-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so the KMD fullnode can do the scan of momom given a txid and return the correct momom to use, and with just adding a single field it seems nspv gets all the data with almost no overhead on the superlite side. maybe we only do this on the fullnode side if there is a specific flag set

[30-Jul-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
which means multinspv needs to spawn KMD, oldchain, newchain, so 9MB overhead

[30-Jul-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
there can literally be thousands of chains in the cluster and any user would just need to occasionally spawn some new nspv instances to deal with the crosschain and at most run the nspv for the chains they have coins on. or even launch them only as needed, as it takes no time to launch a new nspv instance

[30-Jul-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
can even be stateless locally, ie. no data needed on HDD. to manage coins that can be in any of 8192 chains, but at that scale it might make sense to have a list of which chains we know we have coins on

[30-Jul-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
what all this means is we dont need to make a globals structure!

[30-Jul-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No I don't think we need to either

[30-Jul-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's a lot of work

[30-Jul-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
we can simply use global variables in nspv, very easy

[30-Jul-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i estimate it would take me a full day and it doesnt give any real benefits

[30-Jul-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Take me longer than that, I estimated about a week lol

[30-Jul-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you think you can tackle the crosschain via nspv using a multinspv (maybe we call it the jaragua client)

[30-Jul-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, I think we can do that, have some master process that spawns what ever chain it needs and RPC to it

[30-Jul-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, pretty sure iguana already does this

[30-Jul-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
making it cross platform and working in windows might be a bit of a trick

[30-Jul-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but i think even windows is able to launch executables

[30-Jul-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe it can just spawn itself as a thread?

[30-Jul-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure if possible

[30-Jul-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
in unix and osx you can just do system("./nspv KMD");

[30-Jul-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure windows has a similar method, so for now, just use that to spawn the nspv instances

[30-Jul-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
that gets the rpc port active and you can just libcurl the api requests

[30-Jul-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its like boost::thread or something, komodod does it for blocknotify

[30-Jul-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Np

[30-Jul-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
thankfully we cant contaminate libnspv with boost!

[30-Jul-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, lol

[30-Jul-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But the call exists in boost so it will work, just need to find out what it is that call calls

[30-Jul-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
good luck with that. windows docs are probably a faster way, or just ask decker

[30-Jul-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why not just depreciate windows 🤣

[30-Jul-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, glad we talked this out. we now have a clear mandate to keep things as simple as possible and single threaded nspv will work fine, in a multi nspv instance environment. one jaragua to manage the many nspv, which means the nspv is smaller than a jaragua

[30-Jul-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmm

[30-Jul-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So what will nspv be called? Not a lizard I guess

[30-Jul-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
likely people wont directly use nspv, but rather the multicoin variant, jaragua.

[30-Jul-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
since people like multicoin wallets, it seems that is the level they will interact. similar to nspv jaragua can spawn an rpc port and serve html in the same style and interlinked with the nspv html

"jaragua client" 😍

[30-Jul-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
a pizza sized coin?

[30-Jul-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
just zoomed photo 😅

[30-Jul-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r your validate_notarization function is passing in the notarization value but not using it. maybe it needs to be checked against NSPV_inforesult.notarization.txid also?

{Reactions}
👍 

[30-Jul-19 01:40 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Noticed while writing tests:
Some time after starting nspv daemon (~60s or so), mempool,  listunspent, listtransactions and spentinfo calls will return error:
```json
{"result":"error","error":"timeout"}
```
Same calls work just fine executed right after getinfo call.

A simple script to reproduce it:
```python
    while True:
        rpc_call = tf.nspv_getinfo()
        tf.assert_success(rpc_call)
        rpc_call = tf.nspv_mempool()
        tf.assert_success(rpc_call)
        time.sleep(70)
        rpc_call = tf.nspv_mempool()
        tf.assert_success(rpc_call)
        time.sleep(70)
```
Always fails on second mempool call.

[30-Jul-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a rate limiter of one request per second per peer, for each message

[30-Jul-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
depending on how many peers you have, it will determine how many requests you can blast away

[30-Jul-19 01:42 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Hm. Still, 70 seconds sounds legit.

[30-Jul-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
you shouldnt have to sleep for any more than 1 second
