gonna check on login post json now

[14-Aug-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess it's sending data as body form data ü§î

[14-Aug-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
need to verify

[14-Aug-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, in the form of wif=<data>

[14-Aug-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
which is not bad.

[14-Aug-19 10:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, if you can manage that, that'd be good üòÉ

[14-Aug-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
just that my POST data handler assumes it was valid JSON. I can always manually parse and construct a JSON if it isnt easy to fix

[14-Aug-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
will do

[14-Aug-19 10:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks üôÇ

[14-Aug-19 10:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but still hold for a min

[14-Aug-19 10:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me give that a try to send json

[14-Aug-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the Rewards are gone. but does this allow other things to also be possible now?

[14-Aug-19 10:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I verified by defining jQuery <script> in head of HTML which the page refused to load

[14-Aug-19 10:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
content policy working for the javascript

[14-Aug-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
ok and inline css is just formatting stuff?

[14-Aug-19 10:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for css it is allowing the inline css

[14-Aug-19 10:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and the css defined in content policy

[14-Aug-19 10:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, just displaying and styling the html DOM objects

[14-Aug-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
style-src 'self' custom.css bootstrap.min.css 'unsafe-inline'; @dukeleto do you see any exposure with adding this to the header?

[14-Aug-19 10:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto may be can verify that content policy change. To my reading and understanding adding style-src should not be issue:
```Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' custom.css bootstrap.min.css 'unsafe-inline';```

[14-Aug-19 10:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I also see this in FireFox console:
```Content Security Policy: Directive ‚Äòchild-src‚Äô has been deprecated. Please use directive ‚Äòworker-src‚Äô to control workers, or directive ‚Äòframe-src‚Äô to control frames respectively.
‚Äã```

[14-Aug-19 10:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c also removing bootstrap.min.css.map

[14-Aug-19 10:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's only needed for devtools

[14-Aug-19 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the console waring in chrome might say `DevTools failed to parse SourceMap: http://127.0.0.1:12986/method/bootstrap.min.css.map`

[14-Aug-19 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which can be ignored

[14-Aug-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
nice!

[14-Aug-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810

yes! works as expected! üòÉ

[14-Aug-19 10:30 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Ok. There are 2 problems on Win:
1. Requires libwinpthread-1 to run.  There are no one on fresh Win installation. Can be googled and downloaded tho.
2. Do not respond to curls or browser calls, same error:
`{"error": "cant find methodfile"}`
or for opening http://127.0.0.1:7771/
`{"error": "cant find index"}`

In case: not only .exe file is in nspv directory. All pages and files from github are included.

[14-Aug-19 10:34 AM] TonyL#3577
`Requires libwinpthread-1.dll to run. ` it's mingw thingy - tried to link it statically but not found easy solution

[14-Aug-19 10:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c added two HTML global vars:
```// $NETBYTEIN - Network Bytes Recieved
    // $NETBYTEOUT - Network Bytes Sent```

@TonyL Yeah, my bad. Started nspv.exe from old catalog (backup one), heh.
Actually works fine.
`1. Requires libwinpthread-1 to run.  There are no one on fresh Win installation. Can be googled and downloaded tho.`
Only problem it seems.

[14-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so win browser works?

[14-Aug-19 10:47 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Yep.

[14-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
great! so the only system incompatibility is with chrome on a chromebook

[14-Aug-19 10:48 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Even in IE.

[14-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Sir Seven#7158
For mempool:
When you press `Update` on Unconfirmed transactions field - transactions from mempool will not be displayed.
You need to press `Update` and `Refresh` right after.

[14-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Sir Seven#7158
In thiss way unconfirmed transactions from/to your address will be displayed on Transaction History.

[14-Aug-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
does it show amount?

Yes.

[14-Aug-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
could it be a timing issue?

i think for mempool testing, it needs a chain that will take more than a few seconds to mine a block

@grewalsatinder the txid in the mempool list is not hyperlinked

[14-Aug-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c does it need vout/vin in that link?

[14-Aug-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what should it be?

[14-Aug-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
same as for normal tx, just hyperlink to txidinfo page

the txid is not clickable for mempool

@jl777c fyi my CSP uses some "deprecated" fields with some browsers will warn about, but that is the only thing old browsers know, which is why I included. Allowing bootstrap should be fine

[14-Aug-19 01:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
frame-src is deprecated

[14-Aug-19 01:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
but old browsers only know that, not child-src

[14-Aug-19 01:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
just to explain why you might see some warnings in some browser console logs

[14-Aug-19 01:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have learned, as a web dev, that the spec is not the real world

[14-Aug-19 01:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
So including "deprecated" stuff often improves security of older stuff, that only knows that deprecated thing

[14-Aug-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
