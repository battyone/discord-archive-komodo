[28-Jul-19 05:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks

[28-Jul-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
initial tx stuck in mempool

[28-Jul-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so cant make a valid new tx until a block is mined

[28-Jul-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
ouch difficulty is 49k??

[28-Jul-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ok blocks appeard

[28-Jul-19 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got Alright to mine it

[28-Jul-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but it isnt mining the tx in the mempool

[28-Jul-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess i will rebroadcast it

[28-Jul-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
tx ce79... broadcast

[28-Jul-19 05:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thaniks. looks like with chain advancing I am seeing notarizations working now

[28-Jul-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
mine is still saying only 2 numsigs

[28-Jul-19 05:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm

[28-Jul-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw other tx hit the mempool and get mined, but mine still stuck

[28-Jul-19 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will probably depends on which node it fetches the tx from

[28-Jul-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe can sendrawtransaction on the mining node

[28-Jul-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
to make sure it gets into the mining node mempool

[28-Jul-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
moment

[28-Jul-19 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
mined it

[28-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Alright#0419
what I normally do for lowering diff steadily isn't working atm, using a new stratum implementation, setting port diff high doesn't seem to have any effect

[28-Jul-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks. i think notarization should happen soon, will wait to make sure that works

[28-Jul-19 05:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181

already had one here, bit it would depend on which node sent you the tx

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how do I actually edit port diff in KMD solo pool?

[28-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
I edit it in config.json, during boot it shows the correct value, but it produces blocks at minimum diff no matter what

[28-Jul-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r sent funds to the second address, its in mempool now

[28-Jul-19 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I see it

[28-Jul-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i still get a numsigs 2 error

[28-Jul-19 05:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it broadcast ok here aswell

[28-Jul-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes,  it will broadcast, but it is in an unvalidated state

[28-Jul-19 05:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.

[28-Jul-19 06:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to wait for a notarization yes?

[28-Jul-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure. i am doing a tx with an older utxo. will dig into what season it thinks it should be

[28-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
please ping me if you notice blocks happening quicker than 1 minute

[28-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
just wrote a janky script to try to limit it, not that confident it'll work 😂

[28-Jul-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r it is being passed in timestamp.0 for a notarization height 2702

[28-Jul-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the txproof response shows it as the right timestamp

[28-Jul-19 06:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm

[28-Jul-19 06:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[28-Jul-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is right after got ntzproof response that has the timestamp of 0

[28-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the non-zero timestamp needs to be stored from the got txproof response

[28-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is already there?

[28-Jul-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it is all part of the same spend process

[28-Jul-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to pass in the two timestamps for prev/next ntz into NSPV_validatehdrs

[28-Jul-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, I I made them 0 and then used the existing code that fetched the timestamp. lazy way, will fix

[28-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is hard to do i have a backup way that can bruteforce it

[28-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but that is ugly, especially if it can be done cleany

[28-Jul-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can do it ok, just need to spend a bit of time

[28-Jul-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the timestamp should already be there from the daemon, saves an extra remote call aswell

[28-Jul-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i was thinking about a cache of notarizations

[28-Jul-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
this will also save re-fetching already validated notarizations

[28-Jul-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
you can see i have several things cached at the top of superlite.h

[28-Jul-19 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[28-Jul-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
making a new cache is a matter to replicate what is done for the existing

[28-Jul-19 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already made one when I was messing around a few days ago.

[28-Jul-19 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for the block headers

[28-Jul-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
just need to make sure if a partial entry is cached that when a full entry comes in, it overrides it

[28-Jul-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
for functions that always return all the data, there is no such issue

[28-Jul-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems you are pretty up to speed on nspv now!

[28-Jul-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Getting close.

[28-Jul-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe

[28-Jul-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, one more very cool feature would be to skip utxo that is in the mempool

[28-Jul-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a mempool search function, so you can pass in txid/vout and if it is in the mempool, it will return it

[28-Jul-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
but also this info comes back in the txproof call, so bettter to get it from there as it saves a call.

[28-Jul-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
that will get you into the tx construction code, which is about the only part you havent been into yet

[28-Jul-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
error -2002 means it is already spent. so if that is detected, then the utxo can be removed from the list of utxos and a new tx recalculated

[28-Jul-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
in order to get the change utxo, you can search mempool by address. this will only work if there is just one utxo in the mempool that pays the address, as there is only one vout field that is returned (the last one)

[28-Jul-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
for the user model of all funds in a single (or few utxo), it should still work most of the time, so you can create tx that spends mempool utxo

[28-Jul-19 06:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems that sometimes it refuses to validate a notarizaion. if it fetches it from an old node.. might limit it to my own node for now to isolate it

[28-Jul-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes for debugging, best to limit to your own fullnode

[28-Jul-19 06:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok sweet reproduced it here 😃

[28-Jul-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
did you do ./autogen.sh

[28-Jul-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
and then ./configure

[28-Jul-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that is really all you need to do to build it, assuming you have the dependencies

[28-Jul-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
git clone, autogen.sh, configure, make

[28-Jul-19 08:28 PM] allbits#5898
Yes I did autogen and configure

[28-Jul-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
any errors?

[28-Jul-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
is there a Makefile

[28-Jul-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
what directory are you in?

[28-Jul-19 08:29 PM] allbits#5898
Ah yes, didn't see that. In configure. "libevent headers missing"

[28-Jul-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
probably you need to install libevent

[28-Jul-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
libevent-dev

[28-Jul-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
whatever the package is

[28-Jul-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
just google

[28-Jul-19 08:31 PM] allbits#5898
K

[28-Jul-19 08:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  PR to komodod and libnspv. That fixes it.

[28-Jul-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
confirmed! works now

[28-Jul-19 08:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the gettransaction is a little annoying as you need to try lots of heights, if its not exactly right it will fail silently with missing data and thien thigns crash.

[28-Jul-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
at worst you can do a txproof and get the height from that

[28-Jul-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
also, it shouldnt crash

[28-Jul-19 08:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ive added some extra checks that hopefully covers the last oif them
