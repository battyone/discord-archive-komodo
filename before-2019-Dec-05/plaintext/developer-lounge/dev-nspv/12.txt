but if it takes 1 milliseconds each, then it could make some load

[07-Jul-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
still, any load will mostly be waiting for DB

I think I'll make 4 servers now with 100 clients each

[07-Jul-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
what load is your server at?

[07-Jul-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
unless it is at 100%, it wont change much

[07-Jul-19 11:40 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, it's somewhere around your numbers

[07-Jul-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
is node fine? - getting `no pnodes` now

[07-Jul-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810

sync is very slow on the server that i wanted to use for nSPV peer. this is what i have since last night
```
  "blocks": 480609,
  "longestchain": 1432437,
  "connections": 38,
```

[07-Jul-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, addressindex makes it very slow

[07-Jul-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i advised to make a bootstrap

[07-Jul-19 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll  make a bootstrap once i have fully synced

[07-Jul-19 12:31 PM] SHossain#0007
i have a KMD node with 
```
txindex=1
addressindex=1
timestampindex=1
spentindex=1
```
the chain is last synced to last month. would that be good to bootstrap?

[07-Jul-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
just sync that node to current and it can be used

[07-Jul-19 12:32 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. will do now

[07-Jul-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV mode does not change addressindex data

[07-Jul-19 12:33 PM] SHossain#0007
this may be faster than my current sluggish sync

[07-Jul-19 12:44 PM] SHossain#0007
sync done on that node. shall i just compress `blocks, chainstate & notarisations` directory?

[07-Jul-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. started with these 3 dirs

[07-Jul-19 12:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
If you need this bootstraps let me know the explorer need all those indexes

[07-Jul-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
haha...yes, we needed bootstrap with `txindex=1` & `addressindex=1`

[07-Jul-19 12:48 PM] SHossain#0007
i started syncing fresh node with those 2 but was taking longer. but i have another node with all of those. bootstrapping that

[07-Jul-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
you need all the data files

[07-Jul-19 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007
sorry, you mean `fee_estimates.dat, fee_estimates.dat, komodostate, komodostate.ind, realtime, signedmasks, peers.dat` files also needed?

[07-Jul-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
komodostate, komodostate.ind and notarisations

[07-Jul-19 01:46 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks. i'll compress again and re-upload

[07-Jul-19 02:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c I think I optimisied way to spam a little bit. Is loading on server changed?

[07-Jul-19 02:02 PM] TonyL#3577

[07-Jul-19 02:08 PM] TonyL#3577
really interesting now how James server handle it, I think spam is like a 50 times more massive now ðŸ˜ƒ

it could be all your threads are not running at full speed yet

prints so fast so when I'm doing screencast even frames not moving ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Jul-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to > logfile

[07-Jul-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it will slow down the threads

[07-Jul-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
you can tail -f logfile and it wont affect thread performance

yeah, I can even drop it to /dev/null I think

[07-Jul-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
it is a pilot run ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Jul-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, good CPU saturation, mem is stable at 0.4%

[07-Jul-19 02:52 PM] TonyL#3577
made assasisns silent - maybe it's a little bit faster now

[07-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
60%

[07-Jul-19 03:46 PM] TonyL#3577
ok, right now should be the best attack I can do I think ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Jul-19 03:58 PM] TonyL#3577
`issue getinfo` suspicous prints in stdout I've started to get (but maybe just some clients disconnected because of connections limit - separated nodes between servers a little bit different now)

[07-Jul-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
130%

[07-Jul-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if the most aggressive attack is 130%, it seems we have no problems at this peer limit!

[07-Jul-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
at 10x this peer limit it would be a problem, so it seems it is good the limit is 873

[07-Jul-19 04:06 PM] TonyL#3577
ah, means it was loading indication on single core?

[07-Jul-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be

[07-Jul-19 04:09 PM] TonyL#3577
130 is more than 5, tried to break it - but peers limitation + 1 second limitation looks as nice organic DDoS protection

[07-Jul-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it was 70% before so double now

[07-Jul-19 04:10 PM] TonyL#3577
on my side it is 3 servers with 44 cores in total loaded almost fully

[07-Jul-19 04:13 PM] TonyL#3577
btw as protection from such attack fullnode operator can ban IP if amounts of clients with it more than 10 lets say

[07-Jul-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it costs more work to send than to respond

[07-Jul-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL updating to new version. this is a "hardfork" from old version. 
it proves each utxo via merkle proof for the blocks merkle root, it also verifies that all headers in the range between notarizations are backlinking to each other, and it uses the opreturn data inside the notarization

[07-Jul-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the only validations left to do are to verify the notary signatures and KMD interest values, which are not critical at this stage

[07-Jul-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that was a long grind to get all the data to match up

shutting down clients and updating

[07-Jul-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
now doing a spend might take a bit longer

[07-Jul-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is essentially doing most of the nSPV validation

[07-Jul-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
updated nodes and restarted spammers, going to rest

[07-Jul-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
92%

[07-Jul-19 04:51 PM] TonyL#3577
just started to get `no pnodes` on all clients

[07-Jul-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
another cool thing about nSPV at the p2p protocol level is that it is totally stateless, so you can connect to any fullnode at any point for any required data. also you can restart a node

[07-Jul-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and after it comes back up, things should get back to normal

[07-Jul-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a good test

[07-Jul-19 04:52 PM] TonyL#3577
aha, so you're restarting ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Jul-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it will take quite a few nodes to saturate the 10 nSPV full nodes

[07-Jul-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it was spewing printouts and slowing things down

[07-Jul-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
should be faster on your end now

[07-Jul-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
164%!

[07-Jul-19 04:53 PM] TonyL#3577
I spam exactly same way as b4

[07-Jul-19 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
`it seems it will take quite a few nodes to saturate the 10 nSPV full nodes` depends of how much is 164% from total of such full node capacity

[07-Jul-19 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Jul-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
`I spam exactly same way as b4` - ah maybe from working machine a little bit faster (before did some reindex in background which took some resources and now it finished)

[07-Jul-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
this node has 800% capacity

[07-Jul-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but you cant get many more peers due to the max limit

[07-Jul-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so it seems the rate limit is working as it should

[07-Jul-19 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
so with same spam mechanism it should be totally busy with around 3500-4000 peers

[07-Jul-19 04:58 PM] SHossain#0007
this is very interesting. bootstrap upload will be done in approx 1 hours 30 mins.

[07-Jul-19 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
home network's upload speed is very low

[07-Jul-19 04:59 PM] TonyL#3577
is it bootstrap for KMD nSPV full nodes?

[07-Jul-19 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
yes
