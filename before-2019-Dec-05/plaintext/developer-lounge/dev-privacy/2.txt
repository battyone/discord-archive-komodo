Tried a few variations of `komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_mergetoaddress '["zs1rcdxkc5nw8mdaysmlmpl8kdzmnvvgnq2svuhdds9u5m4le49dkl730hk6406cdv6e9qwqz55xdl"]' zs17rmacnj36nl5vlx9ej80330zwsjaufasccmwc5s46zw4jyhr0mqywaafdj5vcak0qxwy2uwsh8q "" "" "" 4b6f6d6f646f`
(eg. " " around the HEX)
No luck.  `error: Error JSON:`
Think I found where I can see the message when I get it send, in `z_listunspent`.
Will try again tomorrow.

@CrisF try like
`komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_mergetoaddress '["zs1rcdxkc5nw8mdaysmlmpl8kdzmnvvgnq2svuhdds9u5m4le49dkl730hk6406cdv6e9qwqz55xdl"]' zs17rmacnj36nl5vlx9ej80330zwsjaufasccmwc5s46zw4jyhr0mqywaafdj5vcak0qxwy2uwsh8q 0.0001 50 50 777777 4b6f6d6f646f`
I think the JSON error is coming from the fact that it's expecting numerics and sees "" as text

From `z_listunspent`

[05-Oct-19 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you have to wait for the new tx to confirm before it will be seen in unspent

[05-Oct-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the memo field will begin with the memo you added (the 0s are padding)

Hi, I've been pushing through a few jobs and haven't gotten back to ‚òù yet.
Have a quick question re: `HEX`
The hex I used in the above example came out of an online HEX converter with spaces after every 2nd character.  I removed the spaces and seems the HEX was acceptable.
Just put a larger file through a converter.

[07-Oct-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Output is quite a massive amount (394305 Bytes) of return like this:```0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00,...```

[07-Oct-19 11:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Should I just remove the `,` and `spaces`, or is it acceptable in this format?

[07-Oct-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
hex string should only have hex chars

[07-Oct-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
0x is not part of the hex, neither is space, commas, or any other separators

[07-Oct-19 11:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks!
I'll have a look for another converter.

[07-Oct-19 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405
@jl777c is there a Hex converter built into Komodo / Iguana anywhere?  Maybe related to the steganography code?

[07-Oct-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
iguana i think had a hex converter, but it is such a simple thing to do...

I'll keep looking up how.

[07-Oct-19 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
I found some for text.  This time I'm trying to find one for a jpeg file.

[07-Oct-19 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
The one I tried returned the above output.

[07-Oct-19 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
The question about komodo/iguana was related to the function already build into the code.  So someone who knew what they were doing could implement it.

[07-Oct-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not sure what the windows version would be, but you can use:
`echo -n "Komodo"|xxd -pu`

[07-Oct-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
```for (i=0; i<len; i++)
                 printf("%02x",&ptr[i*2]);```

[07-Oct-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
given a ptr to data, the above will print out the hex, it is one of the simplest "conversions" there is

[07-Oct-19 11:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks!

[07-Oct-19 03:00 PM] gcharang#6833
for `0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00,`
the hex you would use is `ffd8ffe000`

[07-Oct-19 11:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @gcharang. Did you get that using```for (i=0; i<len; i++)
                 printf("%02x",&ptr[i*2]);```?
The example `0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00,` is just the first part of a 394305 Byte jpg.

[08-Oct-19 02:11 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF no, I just removed "0x" and spaces, converted capital to small for the hex output you have posted
`0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00` is the same as `ffd8ffe000`

[10-Oct-19 08:47 AM] CrisF#3405

Is this beyond the scope of Komodo and something for the client to set up?  (I need to confirm)

Or is there a blockchain based solution?

[22-Nov-19 04:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Do  smart addresses work for z addresses
can  I  create a zadd  to send  pirate to that  will  eventually  work  with  same seed  I am using  for AtomicDEX is the question

[22-Nov-19 04:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
hopefully  the  right  channel  CG

[22-Nov-19 04:27 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
trying  to remember  old Barterdex  cli  days and creating newaddress---  I guess there was a zadd, but is it smart?

[22-Nov-19 04:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
need to move KMDICE and ARRR before  I forget  I  have them  or which CEX  they  are  at

[22-Nov-19 04:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I answered my  question - but I will leave this  post for  education - use Versus AGAMA with same seed   - start Pirate - get addresss - "Send it and forget it"

[22-Nov-19 05:48 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
OK  - so wen zSPV or znSPV?

is there an app that creates new seeds after you use the old one? - Does Ocean

[22-Nov-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Ocean doesn't use seeds (they are generally for lite wallets only)

[22-Nov-19 05:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i have a 20 coins in my test wallet

[22-Nov-19 05:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
20 different

[22-Nov-19 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
There's generally no need for a seed/passphrase on a local wallet because you don't need to prove to you that you are you

[22-Nov-19 05:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
right

[22-Nov-19 06:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i was just going to move ARRR to the same seed my test wallet uses

[22-Nov-19 06:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but now it looks like I need a new seed

[22-Nov-19 06:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I wasn't aware of any wallets that have seed/passphrase for z addys, what are you using?

[22-Nov-19 06:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
wasnt planning on spending any until DEX supports

[22-Nov-19 06:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[22-Nov-19 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

pirate light has restore wallet from 24 word seed

[22-Nov-19 06:07 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I assume the AtomicDEX uses same system for 24 word seeds

[22-Nov-19 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
no, they are totally different things (that's why pirate lite has its own wallet.dat file even)

[22-Nov-19 06:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so now I need to move all 20+ coins to a new 24 word seed - for hacker resons alone I  suppose

[22-Nov-19 06:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I was researching zSPV

[22-Nov-19 06:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks like soonish

[22-Nov-19 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
hopefully

[22-Nov-19 06:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so I "could" use same 24  word  seed but it would generate a different z address - from  pirate light to say future AtomicDEX

[22-Nov-19 06:15 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I guess so, it's hard to say what one could or could not do on a thing that isn't yet ü§∑üèΩ
