or I guess that is what the `minutes -= 59;` is for in the interest function

[31-Oct-18 02:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it still means you don't have to wait an hour to start accruing rewards like most normal users if you manually set nLocktime just under an hour in the past, right?

[31-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[31-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
we had a compound interest attack that did that

[31-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is a one hour setback

[31-Oct-18 02:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
awww

[31-Oct-18 02:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
I was gonna try that

[31-Oct-18 02:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
:trollface:

[01-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jorian#4555
nice locktime

[01-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jorian#4555
any idea when this is merged?

[01-Nov-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
The Ledger reward claiming app will be a third party app

[01-Nov-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
development should be finished this month but not sure how long it will take for Ledger to approve the changes to the KMD Ledger app

[01-Nov-18 04:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
Btw, I think there are some errors here:
https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/71729215/What+is+the+5+Komodo+Stake+Reward

```
The 5% reward starts accumulating after a few minutes if you hold over 10 KMD in your wallet.
```

It will more likely be around an hour not a few minutes if nLockTime is set slightly in the past.

```
It is very similar to POS 
```
And then in the next line:
```
KMD's POS is a hybrid zero footprint proof of stake
```

These two statements seem to contradict each other, saying it's **similar** to PoS and then saying it **is** PoS then saying it's **hybrid** PoS.

Also, it's completely unrelated to PoS, it's not a consensus mechanism. I think the comparison to PoS is confusing, PoS should either not be mentioned at all, or only be mentioned purely to explain that Komodo is not PoS and KMD rewards are nothing to do with stake rewards.

@jl777c just FYI, in the first transaction I set nLocktime to 777 instead of a timestamp in error.

However it was accepted by the network and confirmed in a block. Shouldn't  777 as a unix timestamp be evaluated as 01/01/1970 @ 12:12am (UTC)?

Which should be rejected?

[02-Nov-18 06:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@lukechilds Great Job!

[02-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Alright#0419
@lukechilds nlocktime is just a limit on the earliest time a transaction can be included in a block

[02-Nov-18 08:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Alright I'm aware of that, but I mistakenly set it to 777, which as a unix timestamp evaluates to 01/01/1970 @ 12:12am. The network is supposed to reject transactions older than one hour. So I'm wondering how that transaction was accepted.

[02-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
pm'd you

[02-Nov-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
anything less than 500 mil is treated as height and the interest calc will ignore it

[02-Nov-18 09:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, just figured that out in my testing, `nLockTime >= LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD` to the rescue

[02-Nov-18 09:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
btw @jl777c what happens if the client interest calcs are slightly under the `komodod` calcs?

[02-Nov-18 09:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
say the client is under by 100 sats

[02-Nov-18 09:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
does the miner calculate the interest and realise there are an extra unused 100 sats and credit it to himself in the block reward?

[02-Nov-18 09:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
or are those 100 sats just never minted?

[02-Nov-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
miner gets unclaimed interest

[02-Nov-18 11:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
Thanks

[02-Nov-18 11:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh and one more thing

[02-Nov-18 11:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
If you set nLocktime more than an hour in the past the TX gets rejected

[02-Nov-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Nov-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that a normal BTC rule

[02-Nov-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[02-Nov-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
or was that added to KMD due to the supply infaltion bug

[02-Nov-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC allows any time from the past

[02-Nov-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it was added to prevent the backdating of utxo, also it achieves mempool expiration

[02-Nov-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so after an hour if you tx isnt confirmed you dont have to worry about it confirming sometime in the next week

[02-Nov-18 11:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
Can you expand on mempool expiration a little? I'm not quite sure I understand

[02-Nov-18 11:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh you just mean if it doesn't get confirmed in an hour, it won't be floating around in the mempool for an unkonwn amount of time, it'll be removed from the mempool because it's now invalid? Is that correct?

[02-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Nov-18 11:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
got it

[02-Nov-18 11:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
just an idea

[02-Nov-18 11:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
but what would happen if you submitted a transaction with an nLocktime of 59 mins in the past, the network accepts it because it's valid, but the next block takes 2 mins to mine, so your transaction is technically invalid at the time the block is mined

[02-Nov-18 11:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
would the block be invalid?

[02-Nov-18 11:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
or would the network accept it?

[02-Nov-18 11:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
just trying to figure out how far back I can safely set nLocktime to maximise users rewards

[02-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a consensus rule

[02-Nov-18 11:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but obvs don't wanna cause failed transactions/blocks

[02-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
I set it back 777 seconds

[02-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the extra satoshis compared to the frustration of a tx being invalidated

[02-Nov-18 11:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
true, was also just kinda interested in that scenario as a thought experiment

[02-Nov-18 11:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
so when you say it's a consensus rule, you mean that the nodes would validate all the TXs in the block, treat that TX as invalid and discard the entire block as invalid? Is that correct?

[02-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
any block with that tx mined in it will get rejected

[02-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
a sad miner will be

[02-Nov-18 11:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, wasn't sure if maybe the timestamp in the block header would be used to check the date instead of the time receiving the block. As you could then verify that the miner was following the rules

[02-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is using the block timestamp so it can know during block construction it is invalid

[02-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, nothing good comes from pushing too close to the edge

[02-Nov-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
we used to get 30 min+ between blocks

[02-Nov-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
now that doesnt seem to be the case anymore, but still always possible to get a long time between blocks

[02-Nov-18 12:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
but a lot of good comes from finding exactly where the edge is so you can be sure you don't go past it 😉

[02-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
I only go 777 seconds back out of 3600

[02-Nov-18 12:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
and teh reason for going back 777 instead of 0 is to account for node clock variation so out of (time) sync nodes don't discard yout TX, correct?

[02-Nov-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Nov-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
also the actual check is not current time but the median blocktime of the past 17 block window

[02-Nov-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or about 9 minutes in the past

[02-Nov-18 12:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
oh interesting

[02-Nov-18 12:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
so if you set nLocktime as -59 mins then you could end up trying to claim a reward before it existed

[02-Nov-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
little know quirk that makes some CLTV claims fail by not being in the past enough

[02-Nov-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is an extra 8 minutes in there that you can squeeze out

[02-Nov-18 12:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
also

[02-Nov-18 12:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
one other idea

[02-Nov-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
I just like to have it so the tx confirms and a setback of 777 achieves this in virtually all cases

[02-Nov-18 12:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep I understand

[02-Nov-18 12:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
what is the time drift allowed between different miner clocks?

[02-Nov-18 12:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
not sure what the correct terminology is

[02-Nov-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
60 seconds forward

[02-Nov-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
10 minutes behind (I think)

[02-Nov-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes a dominant miner can likely gain an extra 10 minutes of rewards

[02-Nov-18 12:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep

[02-Nov-18 12:10 PM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, I guess that's not a huge issues

[02-Nov-18 12:10 PM] lukechilds#2707
if it's only 1 min forward

[02-Nov-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
much bigger issues at play if there is such a dominant miner than fractional gains from rewards

[02-Nov-18 12:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
wait, where does the extra 10 mins come from?

[02-Nov-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
blocktimestamps are arbitrary

[02-Nov-18 12:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
I was gonna say they get extra fees becuase their clock is 1 min ahead of the clients clock that calcualted their interest

[02-Nov-18 12:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
and other miners will accept that due to the 1 min drift allowance

[02-Nov-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is the best time reference the blockchain has

[02-Nov-18 12:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
but how do you go from 1 min extra to 10 mins extra?

[02-Nov-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
there needs to be more negative timestamps allowed than forward timestamps

[02-Nov-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
to avoid timewarp attacks

[02-Nov-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can have a block a minute from the future or 10 minutes in the past

[02-Nov-18 12:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
but the negative timestamps won't affect interest will they? because the interest calcs are done via a users clock, not the blockhcain timestamps

[02-Nov-18 12:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
*the interest calcs signed in the TX

[02-Nov-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
unless there is a timewarp attack going on, it wont affect things

[02-Nov-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
even with a timewarp attack going on, by back dating it 777 seconds, i think most cases are fine

[02-Nov-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
calculate based on local clock, consensus based on previous blocktime and nLockTime

[02-Nov-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
there really are a lot of different things going on and getting a stable working consensus wasnt easy

[02-Nov-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
now that it works, I dont want to fix it

[02-Nov-18 12:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I will definitely use 777 in our app

[02-Nov-18 12:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
just wanted to understand how it worked

[02-Nov-18 12:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for taking the time to explain
