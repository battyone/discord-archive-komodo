@Deleted User got some help from JL, i have the right equation, just not the right rate of 0.05 annually. projected months means how many months you're projecting your interest

[10-Jul-19 03:23 PM] KevinS#0577
thank you though!

@Deleted User you just keep exporting pubkey. Once you send it, it will combine all the UTXO so the next time you do it wont be as annoying

[14-Jul-19 01:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Ah ok

on the ledger when you press to confirm export pub key and new microsoft security dialog box appears now, first time that I have seen it

[12-Aug-19 01:35 AM] klein#5233
and it fails

[12-Aug-19 01:40 AM] klein#5233
I might have broken the "developer options" settings on firefox with an update? but now I can't remember what it was

@hyperDEX

[12-Aug-19 08:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
use chrome

[12-Aug-19 08:58 AM] klein#5233
yeah same result with both

[12-Aug-19 08:58 AM] klein#5233
will try again will try again with chrome

[12-Aug-19 08:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
will do a test later today for you

[12-Aug-19 08:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
see if i can replicate

[12-Aug-19 08:59 AM] klein#5233
it fails with multiple attempts on firefox, didn't have the patience to replacate it all the way with chrome will do now

it failed first go and quickly with chrome

[12-Aug-19 09:04 AM] klein#5233
in firefox  the ledger asks me to export pub key multiple times, is very slow than fails

[12-Aug-19 09:05 AM] klein#5233
in chrome it just fails after one attempt

[12-Aug-19 09:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Hmmm ok will take a look in a littlewhile

hmm I am trying on two different laptops

[12-Aug-19 11:21 AM] klein#5233
lol I went to check the version of komodo on my ledger

[12-Aug-19 11:21 AM] klein#5233
saw it was old

[12-Aug-19 11:22 AM] klein#5233
went to update, failed than said need to install bitcoin and eth

[12-Aug-19 11:22 AM] klein#5233
than komodo app on my ledger disappeared

[12-Aug-19 11:37 AM] klein#5233
lol I go to install latest version of bitcoin and it says bitcoin and etherum app needed

[12-Aug-19 11:37 AM] klein#5233
eth installs

[12-Aug-19 11:37 AM] klein#5233
but bitcoin doesn't

[12-Aug-19 11:40 AM] klein#5233
seems like a problem with my ledger

[12-Aug-19 11:52 AM] klein#5233
Komodo app disappeared, can't transact = strong HODL game :troll:

[12-Aug-19 12:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh....for that you have to remove all apps

[12-Aug-19 12:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So it you have KMD ETH BTC delete them in that order

[12-Aug-19 12:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
then add them back in, in reverse BTC ETH KMD

[12-Aug-19 12:17 PM] klein#5233
cheers will give it a go

[12-Aug-19 12:49 PM] klein#5233
success

there is currently an attacker bringing down nodes on the KMD network, they have taken down the node we query for the ledger rewards claim app

[04-Nov-19 10:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
this is why it isn't working

[04-Nov-19 10:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
james has pushed a fix

[04-Nov-19 10:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
I will update and everything should be working again shortly

[04-Nov-19 10:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
sorry for the inconvenience

what requests does this server fulfill? is there a way to do it locally?

[04-Nov-19 10:46 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, would be better if users could run the claim app locally. @hyperDEX said an app like this might be released a while ago.

[04-Nov-19 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
All good now

[04-Nov-19 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c @SHossain it's just a standard insight node

[04-Nov-19 11:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
we just spun up our own instance with generous API limits because BIP44 account discovery requires a lot of requests and all the existing API servers banned us if we tried to use them

[04-Nov-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
you might consider using libnspv, it supports a similar dataset as insight

[04-Nov-19 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
but anyone can run the app locally and point it to their own local insight server or another remote insight server

[04-Nov-19 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
nice

[04-Nov-19 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not familiar with libnspv

[04-Nov-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a superlite client

[04-Nov-19 11:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
can I query by address?

[04-Nov-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it supports addressindex calls

[04-Nov-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it even supports mempool queries, rather queries about the mempool

[04-Nov-19 11:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
nice

[04-Nov-19 11:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm assuming this is talking over the p2p protocol?

[04-Nov-19 11:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
so wouldn't work from a browser without a HTTP proxy?

[04-Nov-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, using p2p protocol

[04-Nov-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i have heard that it builds via wasm, but not familiar with the details

[04-Nov-19 11:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's really cool

[04-Nov-19 11:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, you'd still need some sort of browser <=> komodo network bridge

[04-Nov-19 11:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
even if it builds with wasm it'll likely be using websockets to communicate so it'll be on it's own isolated browser network until a bridge node connects the websocket/komodo networks together

[04-Nov-19 11:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
where are all the indexes stored?

[04-Nov-19 11:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you need special fully indexed full nodes that are indexing all addresses?

[04-Nov-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
on fullnodes that support it

[04-Nov-19 11:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
are they indexing everything like insight/electrum?

[04-Nov-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses the same -addressindex that insight explorers are calling

[04-Nov-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
insight is just a html front end to the -addressindex calls

[04-Nov-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the DB is inside the komodod, not the insight, at least there is no need for a DB at the insight level as the addressindex rpc calls returns all the relevant info

[04-Nov-19 11:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's awesome

[04-Nov-19 11:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you know why addressindex isn't supported in bitcoin core?

[04-Nov-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know why 4MB blocks arent supported in bitcoin legacy?

[04-Nov-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
even though segwit blocks can be 4MB in size

[04-Nov-19 11:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
because there wasn't consensus to hardfork to a bigger block size

[04-Nov-19 11:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
genuinely interested in the reasoning behind `-addressindex` being rejected though

[04-Nov-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
why do they deprecate rpc that is universally used?

[04-Nov-19 12:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
Cos bitcoin-cli RPC sucks and rather than keep bloating the same methods they add new more specific ones

[04-Nov-19 12:10 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you don't know the reason why no worries, I just assumed there was some history behind it as I'm sure BitPay tried to get it merged in but Googled and can't find a PR or any more info on it

[04-Nov-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
you can try to justify changing how an existing rpc call works and making a different rpc call that worked the way it used to, but really there is no excuse for such breaking of backward compatibility. just make new functionality have new rpc, and dont break the existing
