Is the dICO still usable or better wait for mm2.0 ?

if you want to do a dico, we can arrange a dico

[16-May-19 08:50 AM] jorian#4555
it will be based on mm2.0

[16-May-19 08:50 AM] jorian#4555
i'm not sure if KMD team will do dicos in the future

I'm just asking because there are 2 very interesting projects that could launch later this year (maybe) and they need wide distribution of coins, they seem perfect targets to propose to use dICO.  Unfortunately neither of them is Bitcoin-based, so I think they will need to wait for mm2.0 and a custom integration.

Do you know if there been any data analysis about coin distribution with the 5 dICO that have been done? One of the dICO selling points was a wider distribution because whales can't buy most tokens at once. I think having data to back this claim would be very useful

@KomodoWorld All transaction data should be available in the blockchain of the 'dICO coin'. Check the blockchain explorer of this specific coin during the time of the dICO to get data that you can analyse.

Would be nice if there was a graphical tool of course, but I don't think it exists right now.

[17-May-19 07:00 PM] bartwr#6773
Also. Any team that launches a coin could help rewriting the dICO app, so that it's using the new mm2. It shouldn't be too difficult. (The mm2 is still in alpha right now. Later this year it is fully usable I believe).

Here's the Github repo: https://github.com/particle4dev/dicoapp-e I could help if there're questions for customizing or rewriting to mm2

it's a good idea, but extracting all that data manually takes a lot of time. I need to find if there are tools available

Somebody was asking a out mm2 whale resistance compared to mm1.

Where it was a technical "thing" in mm1 it can also be restrictive in mm2 with a flag set of "max per swap per pubkey".

Slightly different mechanism to perform resistance.  Can be gamed if a whale wanted to participate with 1000 instances perhaps.

@KomodoWorld I think you asked a cpl weeks ago

[22-Jun-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is highly resistant to the non-technical whale

[22-Jun-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but if a whale has technical skills too, well,  they can dominate any online sales process,but such techie-whales are very very rare

I know this isn't really a dICO, but there's a swiss company hoping to run an ICO adhering to KYC regulation, and have a few thousand dollars to put into a good ICO dashboard. I want to support komodo/the community so if it's possible to do (not really decentralized), would anyone be willing to give a quote? 
Here are the requirements;
Presale of NFT indicating a set SuperNode, which will receive a % of bought back tokens quarterly.
Main sale of regular currency.
Competitive supernodes: quarterly top 10 holders are locked in for next quarter, receiving same benefits as set Supernodes.

Their main application is built on HyperLedger, and the main use of the token will be purchase of their services. 

If this is possible, please send any quote you have üòÑ Thanks in advance, and I hope I can inject a bit of support to the Komodo community if possible. (Don't undersell yourself, and give as realistic a quote as possible).
