[15-Nov-18 04:25 PM] jorian#4555
you'd have to build yourself

[15-Nov-18 04:25 PM] jorian#4555
are you able?

[15-Nov-18 04:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
most likley not haha

[15-Nov-18 04:25 PM] jorian#4555

[15-Nov-18 04:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i thought it was just a folder to extract

[15-Nov-18 04:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
windows

[15-Nov-18 04:26 PM] BL0ckchain#6564

Thanks for the feedback. I’ll see what I can do to adjust. I actually noticed this once I saw it on my secondary monitor. Looks fine on the good screen but on a regular old screen it’s average.

[15-Nov-18 04:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
thanks @BL0ckchain

[15-Nov-18 04:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[15-Nov-18 04:29 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
cheers @BL0ckchain  we was trying for hrs last night trying to learn it. turns out we using wrong build XD

[15-Nov-18 07:55 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
We on agama yet or still have to do it with cli

[15-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Nagol#1866
They said Agama was real close. Havnt heard anything yet though.

[15-Nov-18 07:57 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Is it easy to do on the cli or not worth trying if you don't no what to do

[15-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Nagol#1866
for me it was easy. but depends what operating system and how familiar you are with cli and what not.

[15-Nov-18 07:58 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Windows 10 and not at all familiar 😂

[15-Nov-18 07:59 PM] Nagol#1866
if you run linux I can help walk you through it but if your on windows I wont be much help.

[15-Nov-18 08:00 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
😂 I'm stuck then

[15-Nov-18 08:02 PM] Nagol#1866
well if you have some time to put towards it I am sure you can figure it out. All you got to do is clone the dev repo of komodo. Then install build time dependencies. then compile. then run.

[15-Nov-18 08:02 PM] Nagol#1866
they got good instructions on the git hub. hang on a sec

[15-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Nagol#1866
ok just checked the git hub windows instructions and you got to crosscompile with mingw so not so simple as I thought for windows users.

[15-Nov-18 08:07 PM] Nagol#1866
if you have ever ran a virtual machine like virtualbox or someithing id be glad to help you if you want. just get a vm going with ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04. And you will be close. If you dont feel like messing with it no prob. Agama shouldnt be much longer.

[15-Nov-18 08:09 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Do I download the windows host on virtualbox

[15-Nov-18 08:10 PM] Nagol#1866
yeah

[15-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Nagol#1866
install virtualbox create your first guest wich will be ubuntu. then once you get ubuntu going you just follow the instructions here: https://github.com/jl777/komodo

Any issues with mining to a Digital Price ZEX address?

[15-Nov-18 10:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[15-Nov-18 10:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never do that

[15-Nov-18 10:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ever

[15-Nov-18 10:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mining to an exchange wallet is bad for a bajillion reasons

[15-Nov-18 10:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@KSanJuan

[15-Nov-18 10:58 PM] KSanJuan#9608
I’ve been looking for the wallet, or where to activate the coin inside of Agama generating an off exchange address..but until that happens.

[15-Nov-18 10:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It uses the same address scheme as komodo

[15-Nov-18 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 that
and "the wallet" is komodod (just like every other assetchain)

[15-Nov-18 11:02 PM] KSanJuan#9608
So the mining proceeds from the ZEX can just be deposited right into my Agama KMd address and that alone will generate/activate the ZEX coin.  Stupid simple then.

[15-Nov-18 11:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nothing "activates" an address, it's either valid or it's not and you either have a key for it or you don't

[15-Nov-18 11:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@KSanJuan  when you can access it in Agama you will just use the same passphrase/key .  If you want earlier access you need to run it via commandline

💯

👍 (5) 🙂 (3) Komodo (3) 

[16-Nov-18 02:19 AM] wookie#7663
does this version have Pirate and Verus native?

[16-Nov-18 05:50 AM] That_Guy8#4893
Ginasis Mining is going to move back to the 1% fee, I hope the miners currently with us enjoy the 0% blocks and I hope this does not deter you from joining or continuing your mining with us! Thanks for the support

[16-Nov-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Very close here to a working fee model for the pool...

[16-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its weird though, it only pays every second payment, sometimes even less, so somehting is not right still... I think maybe the amount paid is slightly more than the total block rewards by a few sats... but the reported balance is like hundreds of coins less... so its counting unconfirmed coinbases somehow..

{Reactions}
👌 

[16-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Hermes#6934
@wookie  This version has Verus in lite with Sapling already implemented and Pirate in native mode  as always.

[16-Nov-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Appears to be working though... just doesnt pay out exactly every 300s, mor liek 1/3 of the time, so average eveyr 900s for payouts... accepts multiple address for pools, and can do 0.1% and higher fee. As far as I can tell its exactly the same as the normal pool fee, uses the same rewardsRecipents as usual, and pays the correct %

[16-Nov-18 05:57 AM] That_Guy8#4893
nice work mate

[16-Nov-18 05:59 AM] wookie#7663
@Hermes thanks. It's just that I'm using agama 40f on a separate computer to get native verus so that I can stake, but I'm using agama.43c for all other kmd assetchains

[16-Nov-18 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At what point do you stop trying to reinvent the wheel in order to avoid properly creating a single tx?

[16-Nov-18 06:12 AM] That_Guy8#4893
Also price box has been updated and is now working. Granted it is tied to ZEX-BTC on Digitalprice so hopefully some more trades get going there that will properly reflect the value 😃

[16-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not listening to you anymore genie... I cannot make a pool for the staked CC contract with the old method and Ihave no choice but to do it this way, and it works.

[16-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is all that matters

[16-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it was not working

[16-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then that would be a problem

[16-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it does... so what the fuck does it matter how it works, as long as it works.

[16-Nov-18 06:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you literally repeated it doesn't work and then turned around and repeatedly repeated that it does
make up our minds
either your pool works as a proper pool or it's halfassed and doesn't actually work...

[16-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works perfectly ... just that payments seem to sit around... I don know why its like that, it might even be like that normally I dont know.

[16-Nov-18 06:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it only pays every second payment, sometimes even less` = "it doesn't feken work"

[16-Nov-18 06:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, words

[16-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this "error" :  ` [Payments]  [tzex5] Insufficient [T] funds (2210.0183308) to process payments (2445.2981495); possibly waiting for txs.`

[16-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it does that a few times

[16-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then works...

[16-Nov-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I cna try to decrease the time between payments

[16-Nov-18 06:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
increase min confirms

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Nov-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also with min confirms, on a notarised chain, it will wait for a notarisation before confirms becomes 2 ..

[16-Nov-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so setting it at just 2 would be enough I think... on test chain min confs might need to be more.

[16-Nov-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will try thanks

[16-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still does it with minConf set at 10 .. but it does eventually work... might just try incresing the frewuency of payments

[16-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[16-Nov-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It works... I think this issue is normal behaviour tbh ... doesnt seem that anythign I changed can cause it at all...

[16-Nov-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the amount is wrong, it would be out by a few sats not hundreds of coins

[16-Nov-18 06:47 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@blackjok3r  Im playing with your knomp... getting error  "Cannot read property 'address' of null"  any clue?

[16-Nov-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It might not be stable I will upload the new code shortlyu

[16-Nov-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was working out of master branch

[16-Nov-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is likley a version there that doesnt work at all atm, for ZEX

[16-Nov-18 06:59 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@blackjok3r  I figured it out.... I had a Z address

[16-Nov-18 06:59 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
apparently it did not like that

[16-Nov-18 07:00 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
I have reached out to the dev team... trying to get a full zex.json file updated with founders rewards... Ill keep you posted...

[16-Nov-18 07:00 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
Thought I would look at your stuff

[16-Nov-18 07:03 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462

[16-Nov-18 07:03 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
not working

[16-Nov-18 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the pool is broken

[16-Nov-18 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just said that .. just trying to figure our gencfg.sh so that you can specify a chain
