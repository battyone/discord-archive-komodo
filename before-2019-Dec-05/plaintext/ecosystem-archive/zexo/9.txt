thanks mate

[13-Nov-18 08:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It had no protection on it ... I added validate address, and added a 50% rejected share ban

[13-Nov-18 08:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one difficulty finishes leveling back out it will be fine, nearly back to normal ... Seems 1% fee is working aswell...

I am obviously referring to him emptying his big bags on me

[13-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bags of zex

[13-Nov-18 08:46 PM] wookie#7663
Out of curiosity, why were miners banned? @blackjok3r

[13-Nov-18 08:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
invalid shares @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[13-Nov-18 08:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its NH ... after you restart it floods share not found then PoW errors like crazy

[13-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But you are not really able to get coins on there I understood from above @Alright

[13-Nov-18 08:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[13-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No wallets available for zex unless you are mining directly to dp

[13-Nov-18 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`invalid shares` op err is not a bug

[13-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
if you have immediate need and are unable to use CLI, there is an agama test build posted above

[13-Nov-18 08:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i didnt say it was a bug

[13-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
not recommend to use though, TEST BUILD

[13-Nov-18 08:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"specifically "job not found: which makes perfect sense, as the pool was restarted and the jbs it sent are nw gone

[13-Nov-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`job not found` is generally a result of stale shares

[13-Nov-18 08:51 PM] riddler18k#0791
is 45.77.56.175:3030 the only pool for zex at the moment?

[13-Nov-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes exactly ... if the pool is down ... and then you restart it .. it floods horribly as diff is too low

[13-Nov-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright has the code to test it ... after that some more pools can go up... mine is paying and I promise not to restart it again unnless totally nessary

[13-Nov-18 08:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it really seems to fuck thing sup

[13-Nov-18 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it floods horribly as diff is too low`
_doesn't have that problem with chickenpool-test_ :trollface:

[13-Nov-18 08:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well merge my cb change into that and fix the problem... what ever your fee is mine will be less

[13-Nov-18 08:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181

```diff
+ 'what ever your fee is mine will be less'
- Everyone heard/saw  that...

-@blackjok3r#3181 is giving away free ZEX if you mine in his pool!```

[13-Nov-18 08:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sounds ok to me .. I htink simple setting the fee to *1.01 will work just fine

[13-Nov-18 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
:trollface:

[13-Nov-18 08:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant do that with a coinbase mined y the stratum :trollface:

[13-Nov-18 08:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
another feature of simplicity free coins 😄

[13-Nov-18 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you cant do that with a coinbase mined y the stratum `
Actually I can, it just involved updating the retired, defunct bitcoin lib that znomp uses

[13-Nov-18 08:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make it pay more than the coinbase is love to see how you do that

[13-Nov-18 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
this isn't SAFE

[13-Nov-18 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's these new things, invented yesterday, they are called "transaction fees"....

[13-Nov-18 08:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my pool ahs a fee ... but its a flat percentage of the block reward, yo ucan inverse fee of you like to pay extra coins

[13-Nov-18 08:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as there is balance in the pool address

[13-Nov-18 09:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant do that with the stratum coinbase

[13-Nov-18 09:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you would need to use my method anyway adding even more double and tripple handling of code 😛

[13-Nov-18 09:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you cant do that with the stratum coinbase`
the fact that *you* can't doesn't mean *I* can't 😉

[13-Nov-18 09:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well I guess you can to anything except make the stratum work with ac_perc wich took em all of 4h to solve :trollface:

[13-Nov-18 09:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
knowing nothing at all about stratums

[13-Nov-18 09:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😛

[13-Nov-18 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually, I'm 90% of the way done that too :trollface:

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and now you dont need to

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's much easier when you say "fek znomp compatability"

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I set my z9 minis to 3031 is that right or wrong?

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im not sure why you keep saying that ... as its toally comaptible with everything exisitng ...

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a NEW option

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
specifically for these chains with a specical coinbse

[13-Nov-18 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the new white spec on top of a pile of 💩 is still 💩

[13-Nov-18 09:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it works

[13-Nov-18 09:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it works right away without waiting
