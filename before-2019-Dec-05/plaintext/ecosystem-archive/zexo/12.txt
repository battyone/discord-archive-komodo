MUST be latest DEV

[14-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jansako#3330
I guess that was my original question, can I do this from the latest public Agama?

[14-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe that build is in the experimaental agama ?

[14-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this why yo ujust dont use windows :trollface:

[14-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jansako#3330
even Linux does nto have an GUI Agama boild that would work, does it?

[14-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jansako#3330
yet

[14-Nov-18 10:36 AM] gt#2812
it loaded with the windows one posted by decker but idk if that recommended

[14-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just build it from source on linux

[14-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as it syncs ... the build is fine

[14-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jansako#3330
yes, I know I can, was trying my damnedest not to have to üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 10:37 AM] jansako#3330
Thanks for your help I will wait for the next build.

[14-Nov-18 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made a blank utbuntu VM 16.04 server in win10 Hyper-V ... copy it and build whatever test you nede there

[14-Nov-18 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
worked well ... using mini.iso its only like 5GB per VM

[14-Nov-18 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but copy vm in hyper V is a PITA

[14-Nov-18 10:38 AM] jansako#3330
I have one already as well,

[14-Nov-18 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so moved to linux host and Virtual Box

anyone who mines or buys this is out of their mind

[14-Nov-18 12:05 PM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
why ?

[14-Nov-18 12:06 PM] ph03nix#3115
you're mining for someone else

[14-Nov-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ZEC is hte same though ü§∑

[14-Nov-18 12:06 PM] ph03nix#3115

[14-Nov-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
forkwitch refuses to answer what method he is using for hos pool so I wouldnt use it

[14-Nov-18 12:09 PM] ph03nix#3115

[14-Nov-18 12:10 PM] ph03nix#3115
maybe you can make profit mining zec4zookoo

[14-Nov-18 12:11 PM] ph03nix#3115
i doubt it here

[14-Nov-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wlways thaiught a 35% founders reward would be a rally good way to manipulate price myself

[14-Nov-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
alwyas have plenty to sell, and heaps of money to buy

[14-Nov-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem the case here...

[14-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nearly all the coins for sale o exchange

[14-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are mine :trollface:

[14-Nov-18 12:13 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
im a simpleton and need to wait for a gui way to send them there XD

[14-Nov-18 12:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
For an exchange that works well.  Mind you we are only a couple of days in ,  game is still early.  My pirate bags are quite filled going to switch over to zex soon .

[14-Nov-18 12:14 PM] ph03nix#3115
why?

[14-Nov-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
testing a new pool now... maybe send your hash there when you do ... I feel really uncomftorbale having the entire hash on my pool

[14-Nov-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it breaks while im asleep the chain will stop

[14-Nov-18 12:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Will be in about 8 hrs.  Send me pool info and I'll try it out

[14-Nov-18 12:15 PM] ph03nix#3115
does this exchange work well?

[14-Nov-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im testing now ... but NH isnt playing nice

[14-Nov-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes DP is fine

[14-Nov-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for a small exchange its really good IMO

[14-Nov-18 12:16 PM] ph03nix#3115

[14-Nov-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED will mine its "founders reward" to a crypto condition contract to be distrbuted farily and decentralised... rather than to a single key.

[14-Nov-18 12:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@ph03nix   If it does take it off,  can't get much cheaper than the low hashrate coins now.   Before nicehash kicked in on blackjokers pool,  was able to mine 3500  with a mini .  Not going too hard in it but worth pointing the machines at it.  Fee tokens tend to do well and always have a market

[14-Nov-18 12:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
TLDR : speculation

[14-Nov-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if yo uahve hardware its a no rbrainer to mine some % of supply of everything ... if only 5% of them go somehwere you wil win

[14-Nov-18 12:20 PM] ph03nix#3115
exactly, i get it

[14-Nov-18 12:21 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
i mean i rented some hash and made profit so far. tho i started last night when it was a bit easyer. ill just sell what i spent and hold rest.

[14-Nov-18 12:22 PM] ph03nix#3115
up to everyone else if they want to buy it :trollface:

[14-Nov-18 12:22 PM] ted#5473
what is the price?

[14-Nov-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is buys on the echange but its at around yestredays minign cost

[14-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the cost is higher now. ... all my sells are at quite a stupid price about 1000% profit ...

[14-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[14-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[14-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it sells cool, if not whatever

[14-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dp can keep it lol

[14-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181

if i wanted to try mining this on EWBF with a 1070 anyone know the command?
would it be 
miner --server 45.77.56.175:3030 -u <addr>bob -p x

[14-Nov-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is that a copy of the instructions from PiratePool ? never used ebwf but the ip and port is right

[14-Nov-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I enabled vaildate address for username, so if iuts wrong, it wont let you connect

[14-Nov-18 01:05 PM] c2k#4915
pirate is slightly different with  --port 7777

[14-Nov-18 01:05 PM] c2k#4915
i used a combination of verus and kmdice code but i cant figure it out

technical - figure out how to do it
