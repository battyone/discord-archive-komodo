2002 is the earliest I have, but I'm trying to archive the mountain of drives I have on the shelf (which seems to be taking almost as long as it did to amass them)

[19-Nov-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
does anyone ever actually talk about ZEX, specifically, in this chan?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 go for 970 PRO m.2 1TB.

[19-Nov-18 12:37 PM] SHossain#0007
they are  very fast

[19-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are also crazy expensice over the non pro

[19-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I fuigured RAID 0 of non pro would be better option

[19-Nov-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... we stole it lol ... new trading ... its is an exchange after all

[19-Nov-18 09:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Need to have site up and working to have something to talk about .  They are moving quick it seems at least on the kmd end of things not sure how their exchange is going

Hi everyone, it's been an eventful week for Zaddex. 

This past week:
- Zaddex blockchain launched
- Digital Price exchange lists $ZEX (within 24 hrs)
- Blockexplorer live 
- dPOW notarization deployed
- Blockfolio listed Zaddex $ZEX
- Agama wallet integration - pre release 0.2.44c

Komodo's support has been fantastic and enabled us to achieve many things in a short space of time.  Thank you to Komodo and everyone in this channel for showing an interest and supporting the project. 

Our development team is working diligently behind the scenes on the Zaddex exchange and we look forward to publishing an update on the progress soon. 

This week we will work on getting miners on the network and continue the process of getting listed on exchanges.

mining cost is mineing cost, asic or some other more power hungry method.

Yes. Talking to large exchanges now. Hopefully get some luck while the prices are so low :)

Hes made more money off minign than anyone here by a long long way

[20-Nov-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's that or starve, since that's my main income 😛

[20-Nov-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@📢Alex📢 I'll ask you the same thing I've asked thousands of other folks that can't come up with a legitimate answer:
Why should any coin choose a less secure method just to pacify the least common denominator of the mining populous?

[20-Nov-18 12:41 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
any investor invests in promising projects, and not in those in which the price is falling all the time. In this project will fall due to the sale of coins miners  ASICs

[20-Nov-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so GPU miners never sell? that is your position?

[20-Nov-18 12:44 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
ASICs more power, will get more coins, and this number will sell, which will lead to a drop in price

[20-Nov-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
your math makes no sense. if a coin only had GPU miners, then they . would get more coins and this number will sell

[20-Nov-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if anything, the electricity cost for ASIC miners is much less, so if we assume that all miners need to sell coins to cover electric costs, ASIC mined coins would have less selling

[20-Nov-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ASICs more power, will get more coins, and this number will sell, which will lead to a drop in price`
As an example, BTC has a much lower market price than when it was GPU only, right?

[20-Nov-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
not having a lot of miners using built in GPU with no incremental cost leads to higher mining cost per coin, and a higher price than a bunch of gamers mining and selling for their $5 profits

[20-Nov-18 12:49 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢that you have fashions to compare Btc

[20-Nov-18 12:50 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
Zex Is not Btc

[20-Nov-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@📢Alex📢 also, the key thing that you're missing out of your nostalgia equation: top-end ASICs are both cheaper to purchase and operate than top-end GPUs

[20-Nov-18 12:50 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
Zex is a coin which comes out dozens a day

[20-Nov-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"dozens a day"?

[20-Nov-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what does that even mean?

[20-Nov-18 12:51 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
in the volume view)) and then compare with Btc😂

[20-Nov-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
200 vs 50 as far as block rewards will impact coin per block volume, yes; however, that has nothing to do with hw choice of mining

[20-Nov-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
with nicehash and other rentals, the entire premise about accessibilty is refuted

[20-Nov-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and what percentage of mined coins that are sold immediate seems really a function of the miner and electric costs and not ASIC vs GPU. Unless there is some unknown hodl force that emanates from GPU

all projects which were on the Equihash algorithm after the ASIC has changed the algorithm,and the price stabiliziruemost, and who remained on Equihash the price fell to a new low

[20-Nov-18 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
187200 coins per day = 187200 coins per day
doesn't matter if blocks are solved with  pen and paper or alien tech

[20-Nov-18 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`all projects which were on the Equihash algorithm after the ASIC has changed the algorithm`
That is **literally** false, and silly

[20-Nov-18 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Any coin that blindly changed K & N values is merely praying that some ASIC manufacture doesn't add RAM and 3 variables to cgminer

[20-Nov-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ASIC manufactures can, quite literally, add 10x more RAM to ASICs than any consumer GPU on the market (or even any GPU in the foreseeable future)

[20-Nov-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I promise you that if ZEC changes K, N, and the var string, ASIC manufactures will be prepared and current lack of demand is the only reason such ASICs aren't already being produced

[20-Nov-18 01:03 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
what conversation) price at the bottom ? the volumes there are ?

[20-Nov-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The **entire** premise of equihash being "anti-ASIC" was based on RAM cost **and nothing more**

[20-Nov-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what conversation) price at the bottom ? the volumes there are ?`
what do you mean?

[20-Nov-18 01:05 PM] 📢Alex📢#0774
no trading volume. the price goes only to the bottom. what is interesting in this project for investors?

now tell me why Btg changed the algorithm)that the price would not fall to the bottom of the ASIC

[20-Nov-18 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
btg changed for 100 different reasons

asics will get cheaper and even more accessible just like gpus did
