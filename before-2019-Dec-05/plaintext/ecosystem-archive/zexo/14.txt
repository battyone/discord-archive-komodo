@sgt-pot-smoker thanks mate. appreciated your efforts to spread the hashrate

randos collaborating, good luck

@CryptoNinjaa 
Did you cloud mine?
How do I do that?
(Noob here)

[14-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Rent hash in nicehash

[14-Nov-18 03:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Checkout miningrigrentals.com or nicehash as cryptoon suggested. Basically make an account fund with btc and they buy a rig rental. Input the pool info

[14-Nov-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Please use ginasis mining pool any new miners, only 1 miner on that pool

[14-Nov-18 03:19 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Miningrigrentals should so start accepting Arrr. Gonna email them

[14-Nov-18 03:20 PM] Alright#0419
getting them to accept KMD would be more worthwhile

[14-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
doubt you can convince them though

[14-Nov-18 03:22 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Worth an ask for both. Killer waiting for btc confirms

[14-Nov-18 03:22 PM] CryptoInvestorAU#8199
Ok, cheers guys.
@CryptoNinjaa What is the pool info I‚Äôd have to input?
Some sort of script I‚Äôm presuming?

[14-Nov-18 03:22 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
http://zex.ginasismining.com/

[14-Nov-18 03:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Go there click getting started. All the info is there. Just copy and paste into ur pool setup on rig rental page

[14-Nov-18 03:23 PM] CryptoInvestorAU#8199
@CryptoNinjaa Thanks!

[14-Nov-18 03:24 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
And you can use your kmd address as username

Just thinking sometimes about the value of kmd, all these assetchain are sort of diluting kmd

@Flexatron the NXT devs had the same theory, that all the NXT assets were hurting the value of NXT. so they did their best to kill off all the assets

[14-Nov-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
at worst, a new KMD assetchain is net neutral as there will be as much funds buying the KMD to buy the new coin as being sold after selling for KMD

[14-Nov-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, NXT devs looked at all the selling of NXT that happened with assets that raised NXT. They only looked at half the equation, they didnt look at the funds used to buy the NXT in the first place

[14-Nov-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
a currency needs to be used

[14-Nov-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
buying and selling are usges

[14-Nov-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
usage

[14-Nov-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and if someone is selling, someone has to be buying

[14-Nov-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so anything that creates buying/selling is good for a currency

and each new ecosystem project brings in a slightly (or dramatically) different set of new peoples, who otherwise wouldnt be in the KMD ecosystem

[14-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if you ignore positive effects and only look at negative effects, then i guess you can conclude something negative has happened. but that is not the correct way to assess things

[14-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the net effect that matters, positive - negative

[14-Nov-18 05:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
agreed

[14-Nov-18 05:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
thanks

[14-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810

Just gonna throw this here... Pirate started marketing the first week of October.   Not sure what else KMD dropped last month that would cause this kind of volume pressure but I agree with JL that Any action is good action.

You can't honestly argue that Gas fees are the reason ETH has purpose and value.

[14-Nov-18 06:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That's like saying people like to speed because ticket revenue helps the city and its services.

[14-Nov-18 06:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It just doesn't really.... hold water in my eyes.

[14-Nov-18 06:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Cars are valuable because they need gas.  
No cars are valuable for LOTS of other reasons. üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 06:07 PM] jansako#3330
It would hold true IF a currency's main purpose is to store value

[14-Nov-18 06:07 PM] jansako#3330
cause then you want as much value 'stored', e.g not moving

[14-Nov-18 06:09 PM] jansako#3330
maybe...

[14-Nov-18 06:09 PM] jansako#3330
create scarcity and so drive the price up

[14-Nov-18 06:10 PM] jansako#3330
not so good for a token that is meant to be used in the first place

Making pool fees work exactly the same as the old coinbase version is proving harder than I thaught.... you can set X reward recepients its not just 1 address...

@jl777c  Alright said this can be merged. Daemon side modification i svery simple, most of the changes lie in the pool. Pools work using a hard coded fee or no fee, still in the process fo getting them working with multiple 3rd  party fee addresses.

you can use that exact commit, or change the lie there to that on webworkers pool

[14-Nov-18 07:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need this for ZEX.json:
```{
"name": "ZEX",
"symbol": "ZEX",
"algorithm": "equihash",
"txfee": 0.0001,
"peerMagic": "50e39c62",

[14-Nov-18 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
i wan't to add the pool setup for assetchains guide in the wiki as well. once we have all these fixes done üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 07:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and you need the -pubkey set as the pool address ... the pool *should* set the pubkey with `setpubkey` RPC if the pirivate key is imported, but maybe that sometimes fails im not sure... if it was just something I did wrong. although I tested that change heaps of times and it was working properly before.

[14-Nov-18 07:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its likely a something ive done trying to get fees working that made it break ...

[14-Nov-18 07:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If I just make it so that "disablecb" option can only have a single rewards address (for pool fee) this would eb very easy ... but to keep it backwards compattible is proving difficult...

[14-Nov-18 07:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still easier than writing cc validation code inside the stratum though üòÇ

if multiple fee addresses is taking too much time, I wouldn't bother

[14-Nov-18 07:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once I have this working with a definable pool fee address and percent ... then I pobably wont have time to maintaing a pool fork

[14-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Alright#0419
isn't important

[14-Nov-18 07:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can limit it to a single address with like no troble I think

[14-Nov-18 07:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if the math is right, multiple is also not hard.

[14-Nov-18 07:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think somehow there is coins going to a change address for me atm... which make No sens at all, as its using -pubkey
