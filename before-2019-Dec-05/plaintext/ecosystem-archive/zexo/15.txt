[14-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
worked when I tested

[14-Nov-18 08:01 PM] Alright#0419
move to a separate branch then revert master

[14-Nov-18 08:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ive been activly commitingshit I think its wokrking atm, but wiuth extra prints

I know thoes ....

[14-Nov-18 08:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but they dont reset master to a previous point in time üò¶

[14-Nov-18 08:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I accidentallymerged old code (not having latest git pull) and broke master

[14-Nov-18 08:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only way I know how to fix, si copy all files out of repo foilder from previous commit and then git pull master and copy them all back in and commit it agin

[14-Nov-18 08:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one day I will learn to creat a new branch every time before AI start messing with things, getting better at it but still forget at times

[14-Nov-18 08:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
found some fork had it compiled for linux

[14-Nov-18 08:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but then it's bundled git was giving curl 3 related issue, so replaced it with the compiled git-core lib

[14-Nov-18 08:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
found gitkraken good, but I still like Github Desktop

[14-Nov-18 09:44 PM] riddler18k#0791
GitHub Dekstop is awesome

[14-Nov-18 09:45 PM] riddler18k#0791
Also use the git extension/plugin with VSCode .... fidgety but good once working

[14-Nov-18 09:46 PM] riddler18k#0791
anyone recommend me a stable pool for zex plz? yesterday was chaotic

[14-Nov-18 10:37 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Hey all

[14-Nov-18 10:43 PM] IndieBlock#3081
In need of devs?

[14-Nov-18 11:26 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Ginasis Mining Pool: http://zex.ginasismining.com is running the pool at 0% fee for a promotional period to help spread the hashrate. Don‚Äôt be lazy, get some hashrate over to help secure the network. üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 11:33 PM] Alright#0419
is dpow'd spreading hashrate doesn't make much difference

[14-Nov-18 11:33 PM] Alright#0419
ginasismining is a good pool though üëç

[14-Nov-18 11:33 PM] That_Guy8#4893
And if all the hashrate is on 1 pool and it goes down?

[14-Nov-18 11:34 PM] That_Guy8#4893
That won‚Äôt make much of a difference for the current block?

[14-Nov-18 11:34 PM] Alright#0419
set backup obviously

[14-Nov-18 11:34 PM] That_Guy8#4893
A set back and waste of precious paid for hashrate.

[14-Nov-18 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
but again, that doesn't affect security if major hashrate drops off the network

[14-Nov-18 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
just means I'll mine more coins on my solo pool :trollface:

[14-Nov-18 11:36 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Potentially not ? Wouldn‚Äôt it get stuck on current block?

[14-Nov-18 11:36 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Due to high diff?

[14-Nov-18 11:36 PM] Alright#0419
would take longer than normal than stabilize

[14-Nov-18 11:36 PM] Alright#0419
but again, does not affect security

[14-Nov-18 11:37 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Securing the network can mean many things other than pure security.

[14-Nov-18 11:37 PM] Alright#0419
You know... wasn't trying to knock your pool or anything

[14-Nov-18 11:38 PM] Alright#0419
was just trying to be technical

[14-Nov-18 11:38 PM] That_Guy8#4893
And I‚Äôm just being technical right back üòõ

[14-Nov-18 11:38 PM] That_Guy8#4893
I‚Äôll still love you...

[14-Nov-18 11:40 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain can you add forkwitch and ginasis to channel description

[15-Nov-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How is forkwich pool working... @forkwitch  has refused to answer any pings

[15-Nov-18 04:06 AM] forkwitch#6080
It¬¥s a little changed https://github.com/s-nomp/s-nomp pool software @blackjok3r. From benchmarking i say it¬¥s rocksolid for equihash coin. Sorry i can only reply to pings quick on weekend. In the week it¬¥s working time : ( ... in free time and breaks i control pool and webservers.

[15-Nov-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries ... I mean specifically how you are sorting the coinbase transaction with the second vout for founders reward ?

[15-Nov-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My solution was to pass the coibase fromt he daemon directly to the block... and take the pool fee out in the payment processor

[15-Nov-18 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems the simplest solution, and I dont see another working solution, your pool is live but seems to have not mined any blocks.

[15-Nov-18 04:19 AM] forkwitch#6080
I have made some testing with other tokens. And for the solution i copy idea from https://github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal/issues/358 and from https://github.com/emc2foundation/node-stratum-pool/commit/35201da1bd9df17c99e76697b305273f4e66438a

How do you calculate the founders reward size ?

[15-Nov-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as the math in the daemon is a little strange... will ahev a look at this code though thanks ... Sti;l going to keep my solution, as for multi sig payments and CC vouts in block reward...trying to calculate those in the pool is basciallt imposible.

[15-Nov-18 04:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
Einsteinium example was super for me learning quick changes then you can play with VOUT structure and everything like you want. Manipulation of coinbase transaction with the nomp code is exciting. Honestly i dont make calculation. I just make static value with 70.0000002 ZEX for founder. Is it wrong?

[15-Nov-18 04:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
Forkwitch pool is taken offline and goes back online in the weekend i can use it for quick testings. It has 0 MSol and i see many other pools. My pool was 0 fee pool and i dont want to steal income from other who have pool with earned fee. @blackjok3r when pool is needed urgent please make me a ping.

[15-Nov-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no problem, we have 2 1% pools up with my software

[15-Nov-18 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But nobody is using http://zex.ginasismining.com/workers
Guys please use this pool aswell ... the Op spent many hours wokring with me to get i up

[15-Nov-18 04:33 AM] That_Guy8#4893
Ginasismining is currently at 0% to reward early adopters. once a stable hash rate has been reached it will change back to 1%

thanks for getting it going @That_Guy8 ...appreciate your hard work
but i would have to agree with oszy...the blue is very tough onthe eyes
maybe make it a softer blue...powder or sky blue perhaps?
