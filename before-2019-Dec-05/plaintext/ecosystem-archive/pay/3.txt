If you read the comments, it would seem people either don't like the idea or don't understand it. I suggest you look into that because the perception is important.

[11-Feb-19 07:13 PM] Fab√ò#8941
CONTEXT
As Neo bankers, we decided to issue this cryptocurrency for anyone who needs
a stable, tradable unit. One application of Komodo Stable Bonds financial services which include payments (debit and credit cards), savings and lending capabilities. Our
payment solutions are independent services and naturally compliment KSB ‚Äì
providing flexibility on how the loans can be spent.
------
3/ Komodo Stable Bonds ; A stable currency
3.1 Function 1 - A Unit of Account, measurement of value
A unit of account is something that can be used to value goods and services,
record debts, and make calculations. In other words, it‚Äôs a measurement for
the value used to represent the real value (or cost) of any economic item; i.e.
goods, services, assets, liabilities, income, expenses. It is one of three well-known
functions of money. It lends meaning to profits, losses, liability, or assets.
------

[11-Feb-19 07:13 PM] Fab√ò#8941
3.2 Function 2 - The Basis of Credit:
Credit is a contractual agreement in which a borrower receives something of
value now and agrees to repay the lender at some later date with consideration,
generally with interest. Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Student debt
‚Ä¢ Credit card
‚Ä¢ P2P loan
‚Ä¢ Equity Loan
‚Ä¢ Seller financing
--------
3.3 Function 3 - A Standard of Postponed Payment:
It is the function of being a widely accepted way to value a debt; thereby allowing
goods and services to be acquired now and paid for in the future. Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Consignment shop
‚Ä¢ Seller financing
--------

[11-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Fab√ò#8941
3.4 Function 4 - Medium of exchange
A medium of exchange is something that buyers will exchange with a seller
when they want to purchase goods or services from the seller. While many
things could be used as a medium of exchange in an economy, money is the
most common and useful medium of exchange in our society. Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Gas
‚Ä¢ Decentralized and stable marketplace
‚Ä¢ Smart Grid
‚Ä¢ Peer to Peer transactions
‚Ä¢ On demand Prepaid industry (ex: bitmedia.io)
-------
3.5 Function 5 - A Store of Value (Purchasing Power):
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and
exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Savings
‚Äì Retirement plan
‚Äì Tontines
‚Äì Insurance (health, car, home ownership)
‚Äì Health plan
‚Äì Vacations

We been lucky enough to test Zaddex, this Exchange gonna be a big thing in the coming months & huge in 1 semester or 2 especially with the DEX being released.

apparently somebody thought it would be a good idea to partner us with @@Fab√ò on last Tech tuesdays :) 

We do have added several stable tokens to our wallet and we are very near to integrate them with our fiat gateway & card program, so it wouldnt be a problem to make Mylo's forecast true, but I'm not aware of CryptoUnion project  status

''Also, the Peer2Group‚Äôs¬†Pungo Wallet¬†which recently partnered with the KSB (Komodo Secured Bond) Stable Coin from¬†√ò Crypto Union,¬†a fintech project leaving Ethereum.''

It's nice to see how the ecosystem develops :Komodo:

[21-Mar-19 05:32 PM] zaddex#2546
to answer few questions:
Here are some communication about where we are at.
The PLAN:
Zaddex will have its license in Estonia to operate its crypto to crypto and it crypto to fiat
we will list valuable and meaningful crypto projects with a priority to the komodo ecosystem asset chains
the fiat gateway will include mostly e wallet, instant disbursement (canada/us/australia); classic international wire and domestic wire (ach and sepa)
Zaddex will start support in beta SME launch via Launchpad in West AFrica - official release count down by official <10days
About ZEX we are considering and finalizing the details of an hard fork
As of today here will be the parameters
Supply reduce from 210mio to 100mio
Wallet will have to be updated
Hard fork will likely happen in April
Time to release properly
PoS/PoW: 92.23% - 7.77%
Rewards: 7.77% per year (dicreasing year 2 mechanically)
and 20mio dedicated to business dev , legal and marketing
Burn of coins corresponding to 7.77% per month of profit
The 60mio supply (100-mined supply)
Will be use for dev (33%) and business dev and legal (66.66%)
As of today we would like to also support margin trading of KMD but not sure need to make sure that it regulatory possible to do so
Pending final signature OCU (OUR) is the parent company of Zaddex (50% equity)
And will handle the ZEX assets
We have been consider transactional mining to promote the listed assets nothing fix as of today
Idea üí° and contributions will be more than welcome
Tip bots will be put in place for both OUR and ZEX in the coming days
Thanks for your attention
Cheers ü•Ç and please stay tuned

[21-Mar-19 11:42 PM] Don King#8901
@zaddex , when you say supply will reduce from 210M to 100M, does that mean existing ZEX balances are basically halved after a swap, or do you mean future emission schedule is changed, but existing balances will stay the same?

[22-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Don King  can‚Äôt speak for them but I believe existing will remain the same and future emission schedule is changed, as everyone seems to be happy and welcoming the change, and they are pushing it out as good news
