Topic: √òPay is an Android and IOS app from √ò Crypto Union that will allow users to collateralise their Komodo to receive a line of credit in the fiat currency of their choice*. In recent months, √ò has worked closely with Indenodes to bring √òPay and the other financial services that √ò provides to the Komodo ecosystem. Beginning with Kmd integration within the app, √ò also plans to release a stable coin backed by secured debt through an asset-chain as well as the migration of our security token unto the Komodo platform and much more. https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

Hey everyone :)
A lot of you may be already familiar with us here at √ò already from the Neuchatel meetup or otherwise, but for those who don't already know we've been working closely with Indenodes for several months now and recently launched our Komodo crowdunding campaign with much help from @Ludom and others. Please do check it out over at https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

We've already hit our first milestone and will be launching the KSB asset chain very soon, so again, big thanks to everyone who's taken part so far!

[18-Dec-18 12:53 PM] forkhembo#0969
That's it! KSB is now live with its own Komodo asset chain, thank you again for your early support! üçæ ‚ú®

Nothing easier: 1 KSB = $1. But what if the market continues to decline? 
Don't worry, 1 KSB is still $1.

We have conceived KSB as a token design for diversification and securing of your portfolio.

You can find more details about Komodo Secured Bond on our whitepaper (https://ksb.money/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/KSB-Whitepaper-v0.1.pdf) and you can be the first to buy $KSB on our website (https://ksb.money/buy-ksb-now/)

Today, we are officially launching the stage #2 and with it its crowdfunding, migration of √ò Crypto Union Token OUR (ex GXE) from Ethereum to Komodo.
We will publish characteristics and the history of our company token from GXE to OUR later during the day.

[29-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Was Ludom one of the founders of the project at inception? Or did he join and convince them to move to kmd?

[30-Dec-18 04:40 PM] Ludom#5832
Hi

[30-Dec-18 04:40 PM] Ludom#5832
@Crabby Paddy I'm not a founder of the project

[30-Dec-18 04:41 PM] Ludom#5832
And yes I joined the project and "convince" the to move to Komodo

[30-Dec-18 04:42 PM] Ludom#5832
It was easy to convince because our tech based on own blockchain secured by Bitcoin was the best for such project

[30-Dec-18 04:43 PM] Ludom#5832
I have a lot to explain about O Crypto Union and the history of the project.

[30-Dec-18 04:45 PM] Ludom#5832
The project is well known in my frenchspeaking Bitcoiner's network

[30-Dec-18 04:46 PM] Ludom#5832
I personaly know @Adli and @fab and I also meet the team in June 2018.

[30-Dec-18 04:49 PM] Ludom#5832
I don't know if the business will be the "future" of banking, it's a start up and it's risky as every investements that could give good ROI.

[30-Dec-18 04:50 PM] Ludom#5832
But I massively invested (and invest) in the business : financialy and with my own work/advises

[30-Dec-18 04:51 PM] Ludom#5832
The business is legit and the team is serious. They work hard to make the project successful.

[30-Dec-18 04:52 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's diffculte time for them because (as you certainly know üòá ) the bearmarket of 2018 (and certainly 2019) destroy the possibility to developp the business.

[30-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Ludom#5832
That's not the point for me. Bearmarket is just a bad moment but soon the bull market will be back

[30-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Ludom#5832
And it's the right moment to developp new businesses and financial tools for Komodo

[30-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Ludom#5832
The most important is to have a well tested Banking system on Komodo when the Bull market will be back

[30-Dec-18 05:01 PM] Ludom#5832
Right now, the O Crypto Union is in "survival mode" : 
- The main tools are ready: banking licence, app and the most important bank services. 
- The team is as little as possible to manage and developp the business. The goal is to manage the survive of the company and lower the spending.
- The strategy to focus on Komodo needs less resources to developp and test the services

[30-Dec-18 05:02 PM] Ludom#5832
But O Crypto Union needs our support to continue the development

2019, Up for the challenge!

For many of us, the New Year is a moment to reflect on the past and prepare for the year ahead.

As I reflect upon 2018, I am filled with gratitude to be a part of this community. I'm particularly thankful for @Ludom , one of our top investors and board members; for @Yassin  and @sœÜldat , among our very first token holders; and for @metaphilibert and his indispensable guidance. 


We've had the pleasure of finding genuine, warm, giving people in the KOMODO community and we hope that our contribution to the community will also be meaningful as we strive to give back.


Shifting now to thoughts on what lies ahead, I'd like to share a summary of my economic prospective for 2019 (ideas that I plan to develop further on our Discord channel).

[01-Jan-19 09:48 PM] Fab√ò#8941
2019 & 2020: Years of Opportunity

What I envision happening in 2019 (and something my team members have discussed at length) is a dynamic blend of difficulty and opportunity. First, a global financial crisis hangs on the horizon and may amount to a currency crisis. While this sounds grim, I see it as a chance for our community (and for people in general) to pull together and find better ways to work and interact. 


Looking at what appears to be an impending global financial crisis, the picture does look a bit grim at first. As economic growth slows and profits slump, we may see mounting debt pressure rendering private institutions (especially banks) unable to honor their debts and fulfill their engagements -- likely resulting in default.


In response to defaults, defiant economic actors are likely to significantly raise risk premiums, triggering cost and volume of debts (and proliferating even more defaults). 

In terms of mitigation, governments and leaders are both ill-equipped and stunted by a poor track record. Many have already used and abused the buy-out card, and in many cases they lack the resources, credibility and method to pass it along to taxpayers -- who are still digesting the last bill.

[01-Jan-19 09:49 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Instead, we will see an increase in protectionist/populist political measures motivated by short term views. The result will trigger the deflagration of traditional monetary spaces.


But here's the silver lining: negative downturns in the global markets may spur a concurrent upswing in the crypto community. Coin prices may surge and relevant crypto asset projects will attract even more people searching for solutions. This could lead to an increase in demand for crypto-related jobs and with it, incentives to contribute and develop the system.


These dynamic shifts can be a positive game changer. It's times like this --when the cards get redistributed--that change be transmuted into opportunity with widespread benefits. 


Based on this forecast and the outcome of many variables, I stake my career and my family's future -- a sentiment that many of us working in the crypto community share. Looking to the future with informed optimism is how we can work to land on the right side of the fence. This is why it is critical that we develop a viable, alternative ecosystem. A major step in that direction is the creation of KSB, a stable coin by design built on a KOMODO asset chain. After numerous exchanges with different protocol leaders, we feel evermore confident about putting our time and effort into to the KOMODO ecosystem, reaching out to new users and developing our services on the Komodo platform.
