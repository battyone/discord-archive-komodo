clearly reaching my current infrastructure's power, not enough powerful server to start spamming z.

(dev is currenly shared with secnode feeding notarystats.com, POOL, and 2 other webservers.)

ok, new server ordered, just finished the global process handling T TX. Figured out that with the only little checkboxes that will provide anon on demand, there is much more cases than just a : paying in Z ? ok gen a Z.
It affects how funds , via addresses, must be distributed across servers, to allow scaling for Z.
(of course mixmatch of servers are possible, a server can be eligible for Z only, or serve both and be included i the randomization process)
As it s currently designed : T stays on coinserver classic, or on any available T server, if it s a z, same : Generate the address on any avail Z server 

The only edge case is that if one side want to be paid in Z, and the other side pays in T. That would have needed an additional process, but not anymore as the server choosing catch this case and gen the T address for the dst on a Z server, allowing to direclty sending back to the src his share

[07-Nov-18 10:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
this will aboid 1 very intensive step, cause if that would have not distributed like it, even T servers could end up handling Z tx

[07-Nov-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
judging about performance and Z rate / percentage of usage, admins will be able to add servers in minutes, without disturbing the app

[07-Nov-18 10:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
now it s time for me to handle Z sending. Will start in 30 min, I rewrote the 3 main scripts so much time that I just realised I could even handle cancellations or refunding without any specific script, just passing good params to the sending one.

[07-Nov-18 10:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
for info didn t touch eth for 1 week, and after every rewrite I tested it : addressgen still works, and TX detection too...

[07-Nov-18 10:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
(it was expected, but, just to say I think I have a lot of work to come, but this is still one of my objective even being on time (end of month), talked with artem a little, seems I will need to query parity via web3 to interact with contracts, but am not (yet) afraid to test that :D)

[08-Nov-18 02:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
new intermediate status will be needed, as different sending method will be used, each one of em just having a meaning : Raw transaction created, waiting for sending, sent, waiting for confirm, etc...

[08-Nov-18 02:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
will be much more smoother than just : awaiting sending back of share

[08-Nov-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
will also help tracking status of internal operations

attacking sending script for z right now,

[08-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
T already working, will need an improvement to be able to maintain the db updates as soon as the launch of sending is completed

[08-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
first I ll just make sure Z txout are generated well, and rewrite T sending to add dbchanges

[08-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
after that ... scripts handling sending errors

[08-Nov-18 04:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
not yet sure how I'll implement it... the easiest solution would be to just retry if a createraw failed after a specific amount of time, cause the only reason would be that the server was unreacheable while generating the file to be parsed for send.

[08-Nov-18 04:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
(after all this is in place, I think I'll need to add something to automate transfer from 1 server to another, in case of a server crash, failover would just need a massive import / rescan

[08-Nov-18 04:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
also splitted crucial data to another DB, no more interaction possible

[08-Nov-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
@adstrakt would it be possible ti have the logo on ai or psd format ? I work with a friend of mine that makes every type of goodies and stuff. I want to make a few shirts baseball cap and mugs  asap to be able to distribute some on next meetups (next one in belgium in december)

[08-Nov-18 05:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Want to do it with kmd brand too but @benohanlon told me it s been rebranded atm.

[08-Nov-18 05:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I told her I ll manage to get her a website  with design submission / vote. Any approved by community design will be printed. A share of sells will go to the designer and kmd team.

[08-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
As she already have all types of machines... I only need graphics atm. Her micro website will be next.

[08-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Am talking with her about accepting crypto

[08-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I don t expect to build her website at start. We ll see how it goes just via direct sell to begin, then will adapt strategy after.)

[08-Nov-18 05:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
As am very busy with jawarrr atm, but in case I got a few design I can ask her to print some and give me pictures.

[08-Nov-18 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
(At first I only wanted to have a cool shirt / cap on next meetup but after talking a bit with @benohanlon it seems it can interest kmd supporters / fans. So in the same time I asked for myself she told me if more people are interested she has everything needed)

shutting down notarystats.com for maintenance, it only had some wallets, but with so many test I need to merge... and can't cause server is at 90% load

[08-Nov-18 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
will relaunch it in one hour approx... Just want the sending complete before installing the new server

[08-Nov-18 09:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
grouped send and processing of multiple trades went 90% ok, only 1 case didn't send, but it's the specific case I mentionned earlier... so  I'll fix it, and relaunch

[08-Nov-18 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
simulating 8 people doing 8 trades with 8x2 addresstypes to handle is fun, but as some wallets are moved on alternate servers on purpose, it slows down things like here when I can't merge üòÑ

some tests done with eth, as I used very small amount, it was mostly spent by gas, during dummy tests, burned some with bad values :D. Will wait until my miners produces me freee cash, didn't find the way to get eth on ropsten

(I could just launch scripts with params on a cron, but I'll try to optimize between em. Same applies for coinServer side, working, but need to take into account the number of total z ongoing on the server to be able to queue the next ones

I didn't want to install the brand new server yet as I want to do it via a script that will handle multiple installs

[09-Nov-18 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I use lazynode on main NN, and I developped functions that can install / configure servers remotely, so I'll use it)

[09-Nov-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
(lazynode even handle wallet refresh, so that will be a little bit of tweaking, but it will help for maintenance tasks too

i'll have to deal with maybe hundred of addresses, didn t think about a proper way of doing, I have a few ideas

[09-Nov-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`komodo-cli clearwalletnotarisations <txid> ` deletes all txs except the one specified ... wallet.dat does not actually decrease in size ... but the listuapent call speeds up as if it did... not sure why.

[09-Nov-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it handles all wallet address

[09-Nov-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt use -pubkey parameter for this RPC.

[09-Nov-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just `pwalletMain->IsMine()`

[09-Nov-18 01:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmm

[09-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
wallet size is not a problem if listunspend and global cmd not affected

[09-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
it could be used as frequent task, and pure refresh as 1 month task

[09-Nov-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats what im thinking aswell

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a bit slow, I used it before with 45,000 tx KMD wallet ... 25mins to import privkey and 3mins to clear wallet... But I used the filter option, rather than a force delete... which is a proper algo, to detect spent txs...

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
handling it via balance instead of listunspent wouldn t speed it ?

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
skipping empty addresses

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
just parsing utxos for remaining wallets

[09-Nov-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is probably way to speed it up ...

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, skip whatever you can

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the walelt is as stupid as we always thaught it was ... it stores everythig as a TX

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and you can only delete a tx

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or add it

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so if a tx is received by you, and only 1 of 1000 vouts is yours

[09-Nov-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it stores the whole thing

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems best way is to detect balance with unspent balance... then remove all txs with no unspent balance

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did that with my filter algo, but only for notarisations

[09-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely cna be adapted to other uses though
