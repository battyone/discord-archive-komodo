that would allow people to deposit sooner than expected, we can do this without problems and it would solve the liquidity thing, and speedup trades like crazy. But as you know, we have to focus on szcuring everything before adding more features, and by securing I mean improving both UI and core, based on feedbacks we get

[29-May-19 03:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Those are features, just like the folio thing I talked about a few days back, we have them in mind and know that could be a gamechanger for active traders

[29-May-19 04:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
All those suggestions are being reviewed by the team, and will get integrated to a global roadmap. Users believe those can be an advantage and making their life easier? Super cool, we want to adapt and shape to users's feedback, so we **will** consider them, and progressively add them

[29-May-19 04:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
the real question, today, is.... WHEN LABS ? üòÑ

if I hit F5 it prompts me to log in all the time, is that a session / cookie issue in general or just me?

[29-May-19 11:24 AM] Oszy#5734
An unexpected error has occurred. - Any trade right now

[29-May-19 03:56 PM] McBeastie#0134
question: once I've entered refund and rceiving address, can they be viewed/checked during the deposit process? I only see the deposit address after entering both intial addresses

[29-May-19 06:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
nope, atm via api but this info can also be printed as a reminder

[29-May-19 06:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Oszy yeah we got the problem on new setup, we re on it

[29-May-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
when CMC?

[29-May-19 06:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
you are not supposed to be logged off while connected and just pasting an offer

[29-May-19 06:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
at first I didnt think it would be possible but now we got a public orderbook and are refining it, public transactions can be reported to CMC, I just don t know if CMC accepts OTC stuff

[29-May-19 06:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
but if that s the case, we ll apply :D

[29-May-19 06:46 PM] Oszy#5734
well, what happens is, for example i am on the public offers page, I press F5 to refresh the page, and it logs me out and takes back to https://app.barterlly.io/

[29-May-19 06:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes

[29-May-19 06:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
because of security procedures, this is not expected so something to dix

[29-May-19 06:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
fix

[29-May-19 06:47 PM] Oszy#5734
oh you were addressing to that, okay, i thought you answered my second message

[29-May-19 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
In fact, to get an insider s view of things, we are gathering feedbacks and stuff and are fixing it on a separate infrastructure. as people begin to trade we will just adopt a standardized maintenance procedure and scheduling

[29-May-19 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
we can t hotfix too much frequently so we re bundling everything before updates

[29-May-19 06:49 PM] Oszy#5734
understand, no worries üòÉ just trying to report as much as I find

[29-May-19 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s very kind, and in fact that is what will help us shape things as user want. Because developping in a closed circle didn t give us enough feedback, your tests are precious

[29-May-19 06:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
this will allow us to provide a global roadmap, prioritizing tasks

[29-May-19 06:53 PM] Oszy#5734
then 2 more things if you don't mind

[29-May-19 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
sure

[29-May-19 06:54 PM] Oszy#5734
when i click on any offer, it stays in my offer even tho I haven't accepted nor rejected it, is this intentional? it fills up my offer list with offers i just checked on

[29-May-19 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[29-May-19 06:58 PM] Oszy#5734
the other thing, is just some UI improvement, when you hover over the rows in a pairing, you can hardly distinguish the rows.  the two background colors are too similar: #191b24 & #181a23
and separate ask and bid sides with a bright line would be helpful everything is so dark and close to each other

[29-May-19 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
this was reported, in fact it don t act like you accepted

[29-May-19 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
see this like a cart

[29-May-19 06:59 PM] Oszy#5734
ok I get it

[29-May-19 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you cancel, the offer will just be back available

[29-May-19 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
here again, adding a checkbox to add to cart is possible

[29-May-19 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
please, nothing disturbs, and every feedback will allow us to refine

[29-May-19 07:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
even big ideas and cha'ges like prefilling or folio comes from users

[29-May-19 07:01 PM] Oszy#5734
I could imagine something like a JS overlay when you select a row it just pops up on top of everything so you could "quick view" the offer without commited to accepting it. seeing just 3 numbers not trivial for everyone.

[29-May-19 07:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
we got it on our list, our first most important goal here is to make private swaps possible

[29-May-19 07:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
in fact, we believe the current orderbook is not user friendly enough

[29-May-19 07:01 PM] Oszy#5734
you mean unlisted offers via invite only

[29-May-19 07:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes, because public ones are just privates with only 1 side identified

[29-May-19 07:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
so if private are stable as hell, public is just GUI handling

[29-May-19 07:03 PM] Oszy#5734
sounds good.

[29-May-19 07:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
see this as something modular

[29-May-19 07:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
for example people would love to prefill order for fast trades

[29-May-19 07:04 PM] Oszy#5734
yes.

[29-May-19 07:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
just changing the step address is created make this possible

[29-May-19 07:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
without any effort

[29-May-19 07:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Barterlly is like a compilation of different blocks that interact but are independent

[29-May-19 08:29 PM] Oszy#5734
i can't accept any offer, it rejects straight away with an unexpected error on a white screen

[29-May-19 08:39 PM] Oszy#5734
can't create as well

We received some reports that in some cases, trades are stuck, while the good amount was sent by the user. The reason is that the #wallet, during the sending process, deducted fees, resulting in...

@Deleted User What would be the reason that an activated account that could previously login prior is now throwing `Your account not active` when trying to login

[15-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause the app is closed for maintenance, like a lot of other exchanges

[15-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
I had to deal with tasks personally not related to Barterlly

[15-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
we made the app shutdown for reasons independent from the app itself
