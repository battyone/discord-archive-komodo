seems I got it

[02-Nov-18 07:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
damn

[02-Nov-18 07:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
pfff can t paste results here

[02-Nov-18 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn t do much z tx in the past but... tbh it would have been 15x easier if I only used it 😄

[02-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
noneed to worry about utxo selection

[02-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I'll have to handle specific case where amount of fees is under a specific amount

[02-Nov-18 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
that would transform the potential fee to a fixed bottom

[02-Nov-18 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't like this solution tbh

[02-Nov-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
automated tests are done on this address btw

[02-Nov-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
seems I got it working even with sub0 fees

[02-Nov-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
will test with sub 0.0X

[02-Nov-18 07:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
is is really weird... each time I spend hours on a glitch case I end up after 2/3 hours telling myself : ok, sit down, relax, come back after a few minutes... But I just try something else... and it works 😄

[02-Nov-18 07:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, hit a bottom with a 0.001% fee 😄

[02-Nov-18 07:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
2 choices from there, either restrict to minimal percentage... or adapt it for very low amount tx

[02-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
... noneed... just fixed it :p

[02-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
damn, I love this stuff so much 😄

[02-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, seems all is fixed... now rewrap things and T TX are handled. I don't have much work on Z as they already use the sender info... so it will basically be adding fee "on demand" depending of the config

[02-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
passing beast commands from one server to another is really a pain, shortcutted it with local script only wayting for params and doing the calculations, will unload the PP server on the same time

[02-Nov-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I realised a potential bottleneck for servers and coins handling z tx, currently designing stuff to get it working without issues

[02-Nov-18 11:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the best method will be to store tx to send and group them. That way on each coinserver, properly configured, it will loop through all assets to see if there is work incoming

[02-Nov-18 11:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will allow better resource management than going wild sending x tx at each trade

[02-Nov-18 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
In case the platform is not used a lot it wouldn t be a problem but in case of even 20 trades a minute in z it can really be a pain

[02-Nov-18 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Batching sends seems a way to handle it cleanly

[02-Nov-18 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
This will require proper configuring of each coinserver but as the final script will be able to handle both daemon and tx stuff based on a param... it will also allow to have a unique task to run on coinserver

[03-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
little update here. Will work the next 5 hours on it. Atm grouping is working, but I want a more secure way... Another "scenario" I had in mind : coinserver down... A way to fast recover is to be able to hot swap to a brand new coinserver just by changing the db

[03-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
passing the pending sending txed on a transitional state would allow to have a single script that could regenerate not already sent on demand

[03-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Had another idea btw... but I feel it could be a bit complicated and maybe too messy for end users

[03-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
as the system will rely on a roundrobin at min level to be able to process everything smoothly, Another option is to just give users the ability to choose : instant delivery : instead of building a pendingtx  file, it would create exactly the same, but for lets s say : urgent tx, and would just shortcut the round robin

[03-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
not a lot of work to have this implemented as it would basically be a flag to redirect to urgent trades

[03-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
the construction method would be the same, only the name of the buffer would vary

[03-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
planning to get every coin included tonight for the sending part (excluding eth for the moment)

[03-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
on a proper format, with adapted statuscode for maintenance reasons

[03-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
this will be invisible to end users, as the specific state will just say : YOur tx will be processed in the next grouped sending

[03-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
the current method just stores vin and vout to spend on a specific file. When the number max of trades per tx will be met, fire the sending

[03-Nov-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
(will also have to find a smart way to handle thresholds not to block sending too much, but as Z tx are CPU intensive, I think I'll just alternate Z and T at first

[03-Nov-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
and if Z can coexist with T (at same time), I will just send T instantly, and only delay grouped Z

[03-Nov-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope digitalprice.io have this method... if not they servers may burn with ARRR 😄

[04-Nov-18 03:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
little update : 

Grouping TX'es made me do a lot of db change. Manually it works (manually activating scripts), found a way to get better written script, trying to align every set of instructions to correspond for every coin (playing with var a totally new way will theorically allow me to just have a single set for btc/scash params instead of having something more specific.)

[04-Nov-18 03:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
atm : status 6 -> autocall createraw on coinserver : generates a file that will have every info needed to create raw transactions 
Then the send functions are called and based on coin param will send x amount of tx in only one.

[04-Nov-18 03:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
(will have to handle the time specific things, but I intend to deport the entire sending logic to a central management that will handle every coin and priotirize coins

[04-Nov-18 03:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
only raw scripts are being written atm, the global logic when each standalone script will be done right after that.

[04-Nov-18 03:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
In fact I just realised I could save a lot of time by trying to reduce to the maximum the cases and coins opt., with new wrapping, it will be possible

[04-Nov-18 03:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
didn't lose time on z tx... will have to find another way, as I firmly thought that selecting... best said : targetting senders would be possible, it is not the case, as the only available command is z_sendmany, and I didn't find a way to build it "raw"

[04-Nov-18 03:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
got few different approaches, will pick the most secure one. Obviously if the amount of z is low, it won't be a problem to chain em, we will only face the issue if there are tons of Z. In that case... I got Ideas I have to test.

So far queuing worked like a charm, but that's not what I intended to do. The only way to wrap em may just be to z_merge, then z_sendmany

[04-Nov-18 03:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
will get T working properly and automated before making my choice for Z.

[04-Nov-18 03:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
this sending part is taking a good amount of time, but I tried to write it having in mind I will need to reuse it for cancellation, so both will be compatible, and I think for cancellation that I will mostly have to deal with logic, instead of commands

{Reactions}
💯 

[05-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Adding the possibility to spread commands on more that 1 server per coin. Specially for z tx.

[05-Nov-18 12:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Unfortunately that means more refactoring and passing vars to subscript as the main can t handle it anymore now

[05-Nov-18 12:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will need to adapt the 2 first main scripts : addrgen and seartchtx to allow em to get multiple or randomized values for server infos

[05-Nov-18 12:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Already done it for gen

[05-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Quite impressive to find bottlenecks and adapting to bypass it to the best way possible

[05-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Definetly harder to think about large volumes than on a little allinone solution

[05-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it will work. :)

They are all the same just colour variations. On dark / light background.

[06-Nov-18 05:02 PM] adstrakt#8509

too much white hurts my eyes, the blue colors are better!

[06-Nov-18 05:04 PM] adstrakt#8509
ah ok.

[06-Nov-18 05:09 PM] adstrakt#8509
The white versions are just complimentary.

[06-Nov-18 05:09 PM] adstrakt#8509
Anyways. I will update the Marvel prototype screens with the new logo - so we can all see in context as well.

[06-Nov-18 05:10 PM] adstrakt#8509
The screens also have various updates. Im still working on fixing up the search coin and tabs for offer lists.

little update here

[06-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
just finished to rewrite addressgen and searchtx to allow use of as many servers as needed, the process is fairly simple : admins wanting to add a server just add a row in the table, and then the scripts will automatically split the charge across servers

[06-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
the reason of it is clearly Z tx

[06-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
as they are resource intensive,we can imagine having like 10 servers handling Z

[06-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
scaling is also possible for T

[06-Nov-18 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
that means even in case of a servercrash, just a command typed on db can allow to pop up a second server with the same exact set of addresses to handle

[06-Nov-18 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
those options will be done afterwards, but basically, possibilities to add coins and servers are not limited anymore

[06-Nov-18 06:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
(options for hotswapping from one server to another)

[06-Nov-18 06:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
if used also for T tx, it can also be useful to improve SLA, as maintenance nodes won t hurt the system, imagine 2 servers out of 3 are down for maintenance, the 3rd still works, so the scripts will only send to alive servers

[06-Nov-18 06:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
having a maintenance will obviously freeze people hosted on the server in maintenance, but won't harm the whole process

[06-Nov-18 06:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
(and in case it s too long, a duplicate of params across servers will also be possible, not a big deal, but..... afterwards)

[06-Nov-18 06:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
my next step is to write senddeal completely clean with new options for distributing load across servers, once it will be done, the last "big" part : cancellation will be the only remaining ones.
It s pretty clear that I won't be able to handle every single glitch / case / whatever with just 4 scripts, but as I think they can be enough for 95% of the cases... It will allow us to plug the GUI to the solution, and run tests

[06-Nov-18 06:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
testing swaps here with only db activation is really a pain, but at least it validates the rules are working

[06-Nov-18 06:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
after all those scripts are done, I'll still have to automate their launch on the different servers / components, but as I rewrote em all to be parametrable, it will basically be only a chain of rules to use x or y param

[06-Nov-18 06:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
I've seen the UI, very cool @adstrakt , there will be things to move / adapt, but once we re all clear on the definitive path / statuscodes / steps, it will be good

{Reactions}
👍 

[06-Nov-18 06:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think we'll have to implement 2 things  : a status page of Coinservers, with info gathered from coinservers and sent as json to the webserver, I don't want interactions on the other side to be possible

[06-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
that also will be useful to activate coins for trading

[06-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
on a dynamic manner

[06-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
the last thing and very big one imo, is the API

[06-Nov-18 06:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think we should discuss about it asap
