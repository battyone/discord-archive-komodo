Haha yeah. That will be easier for conveying ideas and stuff ^^. As it will be public later if I manage to have everything working people will see the dev history

(obviously am in a  rushcoding mode, so a lot of things will change, and refacto of code... when everything is in place=

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
next step is to get address generator done tomorrow, then begin scripting the serverside for tx parsing

[18-Oct-18 04:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
I will need people for betatesting when it s done, I will fund the coins needed for swap

address gen script working, integrating 😃

[18-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
address gen script incorporated

[18-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
next step : parseTX 😃

[18-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
after the parse TX is done I think I'm mostly done in terms of automation logic

[18-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
will try to code it tonight

[18-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe, If I manage to get it working tonight, that we'll have an alpha very sooner than predicted 🤞

[18-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
address gen script is standalone and already configured to handle only its stuff depending on trade status

[18-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
damn family time... wanted to dev tx logic but it will have to wait a little 😄

[18-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000

adding the genscript on cron and going to eat

[18-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
when the cron for genscript will work, you ll be able to go through steps 0 to 3 with address generation

[18-Oct-18 04:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Dang man.... space pirates now!!!  Digging it 😊

[18-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000

[18-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, addressgen is done automatic now

[18-Oct-18 04:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, the logic is working for addy gen, validated, cron works

[18-Oct-18 04:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
see you for tx handling in a few hours ^^

[18-Oct-18 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, manual scripts to scrutinize tx are mostly done, now it s time to think to every edge case.

[18-Oct-18 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
tomorrow I'll manage to code the sending back, and handle exceptions and calcellation, and wrap all this on a cronnable job then... We'll have to test 😄

[18-Oct-18 11:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
really want to present you something that works 😄

[19-Oct-18 11:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sending back will hopefully be available tonight. Did it manually but will try to have everything auto today

[19-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
thinking about it yesterday... Another part with "without received trades" can also be coded... That will basically act like an exchange, with dedicated part. Thats absolutely not one of my goal, but the exchange mode seems possible

[19-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
people would be able to see public calls for  swaps and decide to respond to the orderbook or not

[19-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
(and thinking about a dice game, with everything in place here I think it wouldn t be very hard to handle it

[19-Oct-18 01:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So let’s hook up soon dwy- I have ideas I want to implement for the onboard portal sooner than later.

[19-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
opids are implemented

[19-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
now I need to cron all scripts

[19-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
and it should work

[19-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
making a few more manual swaps

[19-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll have a specific way for funds recovering

[19-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
trying to find a way to prevent use of admin

[19-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
so far so good, it seems working well, testing it back atm

[19-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
if I finish it at start of next week

[19-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll make a tutorial video

[19-Oct-18 02:41 PM] SHossain#0007
nice work @Deleted User

[19-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
hope it will help people stop being scammed

[19-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
unfortunately I only have a very little vm on this for now, will need a 32G at least to support more AC

[19-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
and if I want to add eth or zcash or bitcoin, i ll need a good server

[19-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
as long as it is cli, I think any coin can be added

[19-Oct-18 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
if you are thinking about longterm and charging fee, i would suggest to get (build) a dedicated machine. an i7-8700(k) with 32/64GB RAM and 2x1TB M.2 SSD would be quite cheap. also, the new i9-9900k is quite cool as well. wouldn't cost high like proper server

[19-Oct-18 02:50 PM] SHossain#0007
VM wouldn't be great for production environment

[19-Oct-18 03:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[19-Oct-18 03:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbh

[19-Oct-18 03:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
atm I m only thinking to have something robust and stable

[19-Oct-18 03:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
adoption will make me invest in a good machine or not

[19-Oct-18 03:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
can t predict if people will use it

[19-Oct-18 03:05 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm positive. even if not, you will have a monstar machine to complement your 49" curved monitor 😛

hmmmm It s when I m in a rush that pirate don t get the  confirm every 1 min

[19-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
will definetly add a checkconfirm method to unload script

[19-Oct-18 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
good news, it all works now 😃 not automated yet, last part is to retrieve txid from opid just to put it on db and main functionality is done

[19-Oct-18 05:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
opid solved

[19-Oct-18 05:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
now I have to wrap my scripts into a allinone and retest everything

[19-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
I may need 2 or 3 users for tests in the coming day, as soon as I managed to wrap everything as all in one to get it 100% automated.

In the meantime I'll add security for trade handling, like cancelling a trade. for kmd / AC it will be easy, but for PIRATE... I think the only way to cancel a trade is to just 

1) Give a new option if the trade is a z_ to get back funds on a specific z_address
2) Give the user the priv of the buffer address

[20-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
here it works on auto mode now

[20-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
figured out how to optim and wrap, now will code exit cases

[20-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
just tested a swap and it worked like a charm

[20-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
swapper 1 : prems

[20-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
swapper 2 : yeah

[20-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
I m thinking about starting to migrate to higher machine, if multi tx are done with testers

[20-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
it works with KMD / ARRR

[20-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
so likely any other Assetchain will work

[20-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
here I don't know if you guyz think I should add btc  and external coins dpowed, I believe I can even manage on mid term to add eth zcash etc...
