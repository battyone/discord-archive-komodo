will obviously have my laptop with me, so will stay available

We need first to have everything done and secure before presenting it. On its current state it works but we don t want user to be afraid by current ui.

[26-Oct-18 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, UX is indeed important; I'm of the firm belief that is much of what plagues a ton of great projects

[26-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[26-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Btw... stop mining dice when I target a 3h timeframe lol :p

[26-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can t fight with your hashpower :p

[26-Oct-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you can't fight 500k, that's on you :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Somebody went with 13M on forktwitch pool :s

[26-Oct-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol wasn't me

[26-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can t fight it... everytime I see huge hash it sounds like : computergenie s watching you, so you wanted to mine hmmm ?:p

[26-Oct-18 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just remember that if it's a public pool and it's not a testing being openly discussed, it's not me 😝

[26-Oct-18 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't pay for hash and then give a % to someone else, ever_

[26-Oct-18 04:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
In my case not controlling the global hash it s less profitable to have 30% of hash compared to having those 30% on the highest pool

[26-Oct-18 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Btw about testers. The first set will be 10 15 people. In fact people in this chat that want to betatest it. The next will be more advanced and I may have to incentivize people for it @benohanlon

[26-Oct-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe I ll distribute some ARRR / KMDICE / KMD

[26-Oct-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or i thought another way

[26-Oct-18 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Once public orders are here... just put very low prices for trades...

[26-Oct-18 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Limiting em by testers ofc. But that could be a solution...

[26-Oct-18 04:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like : hey guyz there is 2k pirate to take at very very low prices, signup and give your traderid and I can spawn private trades that will pay testers just by using the ui

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[26-Oct-18 04:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Signup : just contact me so I can setup the trades)

[26-Oct-18 04:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
And then prove you did your own ones and get rewarded for it / feedback)

[26-Oct-18 04:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
(That s one of the reason I mine KMDICE atm)

[26-Oct-18 04:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously amounts won t be huge but in itself it adds to the happiness of being one of the first to test a little reward)

[26-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
For information am waiting for @adstrakt feedback and discussion to resume the rewriting of serverside scripts. Useless to rewrite everything until we agree on a scheme

[26-Oct-18 04:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
But even without coding... i managed to think about reuse of functions with params. Will make code cleaner and easier to maintain

[26-Oct-18 04:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like the searchtx stuff.

[27-Oct-18 09:20 AM] adstrakt#8509
So we prepared a brief technical document outlining how we would build the GUI. Happy to hear feedback or suggestions. This is not set in stone but more a base from which we can get started.

About the name, will we stick w Jawarrr or change it? I had a look at available domains, the best related one that I found is Barterelly

[27-Oct-18 01:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
But it's fine either way for me

[27-Oct-18 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Honestly as I told to @adstrakt the name is not fixed yet. I reviewed a list but I didn t find a name that would be easily on people mind / memories.

[27-Oct-18 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it s up to you ^^

[27-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Crazy thing possible is to have multiple css that could allow multiple templates based on domain names :p

[28-Oct-18 07:32 AM] adstrakt#8509
In my opinion the product / brand name should be something that resonates with its target market.  Using keywords such as barter / trade /swap etc could help people remember the product. I think Barterlly although a bit mainstreamish is a really good option. Everyone knows Changelly so people can relate to that and even place us as direct alternative/option to them. I guess mainstream is good thing here, but we could also go for something more creative / unique. I will be thinking of alternatives. But i recommend buying  Barterlly as soon as possible.

[28-Oct-18 07:17 PM] adstrakt#8509
Got it @KomodoWorld - we will start working tomorrow and go full steam. Should have some first design drafts for both app and logo before the end of the week.

[28-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Both domains ordered with both .com and .io extensions. : barterelly.com / io
Barterlly.com / io

[28-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
As @KomodoWorld and @adstrakt didn t type the same, i thought it was better to have both domains with both extensions

[28-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will setup redirecting tomorrow.

[28-Oct-18 09:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
About the hidden stuff. As I said to @KomodoWorld i believe that we should try to include in native mode any specific functionnality that could be needed. Just an example : 
Imagine it is run by a company. On its current state I think it s a requirement. The company won t take risks for free. So that means they should be able to "puncture" by a specific amount / percentage. All this stuff natively included and modifiable via a specific parameter table / whatever. That could even allow special event like : today swapping is free. Or just for a coin is without fee. 

Including this type of logic seems best done during inception than afterwards.


Another thing I will include is the ability for any side to choose to do only z tx for compatible chains. Basically just a checkbox will make it very easy.

This indeed seems like a good idea but in that case it could make things harder hw side. So including a potential additional fee maybe is useful.

Maybe this stuff will never be used : i mean the fee side... but if it s handled by default... it s better ^^

Do you guys know where you want to host the  website? It would be nice to define that soon, so we can deploy early iterations and share our progress with you

As I don't know your setup, I assume you will have a private test environment. If you want me to prepare a webserver and give you access, just give me your prerequisites and I'll do this

[29-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
starting to play with parity for eth stuff

[29-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Deleted User#0000

[29-Oct-18 12:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
for information, asked to @artem.pikulin, he redirected me to parity for eth stuff

[29-Oct-18 04:02 PM] maxijb#2198
Cool @Deleted User yeah, I was planning to have a beta environment and another for production. I can deploy to a free plan in zeit.co or heroku for the moment (or the starter plan in digitalocean). But usually deploying to a new provider requires some tweaks, so it would be nice to do it only once. About requirements we need a server with ssh access, where we can run nodejs and mysql. We'll need to be able to request two port numbers (for frontend and backend) and to assign domain names and paths to those ports

[29-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
in terms of hw required ?

[29-Oct-18 04:06 PM] maxijb#2198
I guess it'll depend on the traffic we expect... for the test environment we can go with very low requirements

[29-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
just throw me the specs you'll need and I'll order the server in the same time I'll order the one for scripts this evening ^^

[29-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
this won't be set in stone, I mean servers. Final purpose is to have everything wrapped and ready to be deployed on new servers, as the ones we ll have right now won't be the production ones

[29-Oct-18 04:17 PM] maxijb#2198
Makes sense, i getting into the dentist right now, i'll come back to you with some ballpark idea

little news here, seems eth scanning tx / keypair gen won't be a problem at all, I think I understood the mechanics, maybe that will be harder to build the tx, but so far, it's good.

[29-Oct-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
lets not delay version 1 for adding ETH, just getting KMD <-> PIRATE is all the coins needed for initial release

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Oct-18 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbh I expect 1 month delay for the UI

[29-Oct-18 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
that means as long as I'm not the limiting factor, and I have things ready on the same time, everything will be ok

[29-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
and tbh this made me realize that maybe a change in infrastructure may be needed, on a more scalable way, let me explain : 

As of today, we'll rely on 4 main components : 

UI 
Payment processor
DB
Coin Server

At this stage PP and Coin server are on the same machine, but tweaking it for any coin to be redirected to the proper server may allow this solution to scale : Imagine server A can't handle more coins : just add a new one (B) with fresh coins to add, and just a param in db allowing the main PP server to point at targetted nodes may be more efficient

[29-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
No limitation whatever coin we need to add afterwards

[29-Oct-18 08:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even if eth not included at start. Make it possible really easily really fast without struggling is my goal :p.

[30-Oct-18 05:50 AM] maxijb#2198
So, I've been thinking about the hardware requirements... we'll need to run 2 nodeJS processes, so that should require  2 cores, plus mysql  that will do all the heavy work, so maybe 4 cores are a reasonable setup

[30-Oct-18 05:51 AM] maxijb#2198
About memory , a nodeJS app has a limit of 1.8gb of ram, that times 2 is 3.6 gb, plus mysql... I think we could be ok with 4GB of ram to start

[30-Oct-18 05:55 AM] maxijb#2198
Disk space, the biggest chunk  will be ocupied by the database... how much can that grow depends on how much traffic we'll get... let's say we start with 2GB?  Plus a 100 or 200mb of logs... then the source code will not take much space... probably 8 GB will be more than enough

[30-Oct-18 05:57 AM] maxijb#2198
Of course, the test environment will require much less equipment, probably we can live with 2 cores, 2gb memory, 2gb space

[30-Oct-18 06:00 AM] maxijb#2198
And the way that nodejs applications scale -as they are single threaded- is by adding more instances, so let's say than one node can handle 10k concurrent users (this is a benchmark that I saw online but we'll need to measure it on our app to have a clear picture), we should monitor our cpu usage and whenever that's consistently high, we could add more cores, and run more instances on those new CPUs

[30-Oct-18 06:03 AM] maxijb#2198
That's a conservative estimation I can make a priori, we'll know better once we start serving requests of course... not sure how easy it is to scale hardware in your infrastructure?
