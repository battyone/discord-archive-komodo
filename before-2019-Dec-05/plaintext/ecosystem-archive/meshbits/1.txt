I'm doing some testing with `cjdns` and `yggdrasil`

[20-Jun-18 05:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when something will be made in my test setup will need some volunteers to test this e2e encrypted mesh network over internet

yesterday following `cjdns` project's core dev `cjd`'s conversation found that finally `cjdns` project is moving towards a cryptocurrency friendly development. 🙂

[21-Jun-18 07:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
earlier that community was very much reluctant to cryptocurrencies.

[21-Jun-18 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now core dev cjd thinks of making a VPN network out of his cjdns mesh network, and using bitcoin lightening network.

will explore what they been up to, and see where I can help them.

[21-Jun-18 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and see how I can utilise their tech with ours 😉

@jl777c do we have any micropayments similar solutions on our todo/roadmap in komodo ecosystem ?

[21-Jun-18 07:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I remember you said something, but don't remember now 🤔

[21-Jun-18 07:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[21-Jun-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810

Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.   

DM me for the link and I will get you setup with the creator.
