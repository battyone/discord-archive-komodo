[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> Put a bot on it and pay the server bill or else they will be deleting the blockchain.  I would suggest spinning up a new chain and migrating to it. host locally if you have to.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> or at least have everyone move their coins to their wallet off exchanges and you can get a good idea of the swap ratio

[tlgrm] <Bonged> The SPV servers must be down

[18-Jul-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Bonged> They need to put a payment on it .

[dscrdeql] <Cypher> @CowboyCrypto If you could kindly send me the logins and change the 2fas to me for the official equaliser server website, blockchain hosting, linked in  and so forth so i can login and talk to the various exchanges, currently you have the only working passwords, once I have the above then we can work on moving the project back into recovery

[19-Jul-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> you're gonna work? lol laughable at best.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> you missed the deadline, we are more than likely dead in the water

[19-Jul-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> The easiest way to save this and keep it going is to create either a new token or new chain and swap out members with new coin/token. Something i have no control over.  2fa remains set to my account and I'm changing the host portal login as well.  

Stex is pretty easy to get in contact with, you should do that as well as they are about to delist. I've warned you guys for months.

[dscrdeql] <nille> morning friendsðŸ˜€

[21-Jul-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I guess that settles it?

[21-Jul-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> this all situation is getting out of hand it seems :\

[21-Jul-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> They could literally remedy this situation with a waves token creation. would take all of 5 minutes to make it. Then comes several days of work swapping it out manually.

[22-Jul-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> at least until they can build a blockchain and get a smart contract developer.
