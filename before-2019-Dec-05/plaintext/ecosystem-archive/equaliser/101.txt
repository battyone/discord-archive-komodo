[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont think 'hi' gets xp from tipsy lol

[17-Jul-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Just saying morning and hi lol

[17-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> lol

[17-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Great stuff these domes

[17-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I assume it's not possible to buy that site even though it's decommissioned? üòÑ

[17-Jul-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I doubt it would be for sale. It sure is a pretty sight.

[17-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Would be awesome as a 'main' dome

[17-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> And have several smaller ones around them

[17-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Have community services in the main one or something like that

[17-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there a reason why there are not many domes? I mean, I never see one where I live

[17-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Not super efficient space-wise I think

[17-Jul-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, yeah that's obvious in a big city haha, how stupid of me

[17-Jul-18 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Not space efficient? There are many sizes and shapes with curved structures externally and internally üëç

[17-Jul-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @jellysmash

[17-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> There's pretty much higher shaped buildings around here

[17-Jul-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Of course, homes aren't naturally as large as the ex-nuclear dome, It represents the structure shape you use to protect something that is highly likely to be exposed to high force winds regularly

[17-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Cryptoon are you thinking that the outside area may be inefficient or some interior space that may be un useable?

[17-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <edsky> These igloos are in Trinity Beach, Cairns, QLD right on the beach man!

[17-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thats a sweet looking place @edsky.

[17-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <edsky> They are pretty cool they have survived through cat 5 cyclones

[17-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> However, definitely not igloos.

[17-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> didn't realise that those domes in resort where from Trinitiy beach cairns

[17-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <edsky> Yeah been there since i was a kid

[17-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> if there was a cyclone...they'd be the only dwellings left standing...or doming

[17-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hmmm

[17-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <edsky> Survived plenty of cyclones

[17-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> if there was a nuclear war, the only things that would be left would be cockroaches....and the dome structures

[17-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <edsky> Bloody roaches

[17-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> That's funny  @jellysmash

[17-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> just been using it so long never bothered to change it

[17-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> like from when you were a kid? or an adult that knew what 69 meant?

[17-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> just curious

[17-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I might try something similar next time I need to come up with a userid....i like it

[17-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> it used to be a combination of 666 and 69, were just 2 numbers i really liked. i am 31 now, been using it since i was like 18/19

[17-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> cool

[17-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> at least it has meaning for you

[17-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> jellysmash has no meaning..

[17-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Jelly smash seems like a plate of jelly you always want to smash. thats why i thought you made it up

[17-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I've had a number of people try to think of what it means...funnily enough a lot of dudes think it's about 'smashing' as in thrusting a 'jelly'...ie adult kitten...you know

[17-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> my favourite marvel character is hulk...HULK SMASH....

[17-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> probably wouldn't seem as long if the -founder wasn't on the end...maybe

[17-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Coffee is gold. What if we could save water and vape caffeine like nicotine can be vaped?

[17-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> haha...hey that's a good idea...vape coffee fumes

[17-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
