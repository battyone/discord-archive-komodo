[12-Aug-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> There are quite a lot of channels already however, a 'cafe' channel could be not a bad idea. As many of us are avid coffee drinkers, as there are wine enthusiasts and beer enthusiasts, we can see if a cafe/coffee channel could get some activity? satoshi for your thoughts?

[12-Aug-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Remember we have a suggestions box #suggestionsüì´  and what you want to see more or less of in the community with channels and things to do. Please feel free

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> There is a lot of australian geography and slang words, to understand many of the jokes üòÇ

[12-Aug-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yep even i didn't understand all of them but it was a good one

[12-Aug-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Aug-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Did you hear when he mentioned 'wombat'?

[12-Aug-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yep

[12-Aug-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I like the idea of more channels for certain subjects, but I think those should be added once the discord grows a lot

[12-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you have a lot of rooms around with not much people, there will be a lot of inactivity in some channels

[12-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> And too many channels can be over bearing. Very true.

[12-Aug-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've seen multiple games channels on different discords for example, but most of the times the last message in there is about a week old, so if I would like to talk about a game, I'll probably do that in off-topic because in there, there are people

[12-Aug-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And that even happens on some  discords with a lot of people. I think it's a good idea to try different channels and see which ones stay active

[12-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> And #suggestionsüì´ box is open for what everyone wants to see more or less of, less channels, more channels üëå üòÉ  Also, XP is not earned chatting in #off-topic.

[12-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It was tipsy-rain but renamed

[12-Aug-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is it an option to change that?

[12-Aug-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I can see lots of new people avoid that if they know it doesn't give xp for chat

[12-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Have you seen how the rains get? üòÅ

[12-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Halfway through a conversation, its possible that people can rain any time, it's sporadic in there ‚úå

[12-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wonder how it gets when lots of people join in and also rain haha

[12-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Probably gonne be busy in there

[12-Aug-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That was the most pleasant conversation I've read in a long time. haha.  üòÑ  Like the 1920's

[12-Aug-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anyone know about the significant event that occurred in the decade of the 1920's?

[12-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Industrial revolution

[12-Aug-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Significant is an understatement lol

[12-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> If i remember correctly, it actually started in 1919, but the full effects were 1923- 1927...something like that.
