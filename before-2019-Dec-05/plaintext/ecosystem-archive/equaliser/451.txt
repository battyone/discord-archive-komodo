[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto- Founder  nice one on the stress testing

[19-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Did someone dump again? üòÆ

[19-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I really hoped we kept the higher price up

[19-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> Cool vid üèÖ

[19-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Guess someone dumped, broke down all my walls üò¢

[19-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> At least you've bought it cheap üòÑ

[19-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye

[19-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 18 sats again

[19-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I really don't understand all this dumping

[19-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> geat opportunity to buy cheap xD

[19-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, by the looks of it it doesn't look like someone is buying cheap and sells back

[19-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> not someone really dumped

[19-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> nop*

[19-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Or someone bought very very cheap and is dumping it, but I don't know how much was sold under 1 sat price when we got listed

[19-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Does anyone remember?

[19-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I have no clue

[19-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> A decent amount was sold in single digit sats, I have cycled through at least 5M I think

[19-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep enough to dump at this price.

[19-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> which is 77x for them -.-

[19-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah my average price for the 2.5 ish M I have now is only  9-10 sats

[19-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Why x77 if you can hold and x1000?

[19-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Idk some people are dumb

[19-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> or they dont even care about this project

[19-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and just looking for quick money

[19-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Oh well, I will take another 200k+ EQLI for under 30 sats

[19-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> It will come back up

[19-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep lol

[19-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I want to buy more at this price if my acc wasnt locked now I fell even more gutted

[19-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> xD

[19-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I would pick another 200k plus also.

[19-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I am half tempted to put the last of my free 0.1 BTC into EQLI and go all in

[19-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> rofl half a milion eqli there why not

[19-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> wheres the price right now?

[19-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 18 sats?

[19-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That‚Äôs the highest bid, the lowest sell is 49 I think

[19-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> huum I see

[19-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> It‚Äôs 43, the bot isn‚Äôt fully up to date apparently

[19-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye I saw it now 43 sats

[19-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> those eqli that got bought for 25,20, 18 sats were yours?

[19-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> 30, 25, and 20 yeah

[19-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> huum I see y your wall got destroyed ahah

[19-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I bought 1 for 43 so it looks better ahah

[19-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> lets see if they get bought for 43 or higher

[19-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Someone will need to build another wall.. I am gonna run out of funds quickly if I keep this up

[19-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I will when I get my acc back

[19-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> at least for  less than 20-25 sats

[19-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 20-30 sats

[19-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Haha that‚Äôs the problem, nobody wants to build a wall higher than 30 or 35 sats.

[19-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Including myself..

[19-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> well I could but having a wall of 100k eqli is still nothing...

[19-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> thats the maximum I can buy 100-200 k now

[19-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Better than nothing I guess, I will wait to see what happens. I will look into building a wall tomorrow

[19-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> btc spiked up also

[19-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> probabily bc of the futures that expired

[19-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Guess I can transfer another 500k out of exrates to my agama wallet.. haha

[19-Sep-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wish I had the money to load up on some extra EQLI

[19-Sep-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I have enough, but I don't want to risk the amount I have now to accumulate more EQLI

[19-Sep-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I don‚Äôt know how much more I will buy right now, my liquid funds are getting a little tight

[19-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep

[19-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Alway's hard to decide what to buy and how much haha

[19-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I already have enough for 20+ MNs..

[19-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wish I had more

[19-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but I need to get to 1 mil eqli thats why seeing this price its def tempting

[19-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> But I cant buy lol

[19-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, 1m would be perfect amount for me

[19-Sep-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Just hope I can buy some more in the future

[19-Sep-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe if one of the other coins I invested in makes some profit, I can buy

[19-Sep-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> hopefully @SwimedDragon

[19-Sep-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah if I had it all in one place I would be top 10, I think my best wallet is 11 currently

[19-Sep-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
