[13-Jul-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> So about two months ago I was approached by management of a local bar and was asked if I'd like to play a show (I play guitar and sing) and I accepted. It's probably been at least a year since I've played a show or really even played much guitar. So the show is tomorrow. I haven't practiced, I have no set list and have to complete a 3 hour set......

[13-Jul-18 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> They will provide me all the booze I want (I dont drink). Tomorrow night will be interesting.

[13-Jul-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @aFastHero nice. That sounds exciting

[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Please. Take my wife

[13-Jul-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> My wife is upset that she is going to be out of town.

[13-Jul-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> 2 of my favorite lines to use in a show: "Thank you for that smattering of applause!", "This song goes out to all the ladies. You know, the ones with vaginas."

[13-Jul-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> @cellulitis the Contra song would bring the house down. I dont know if they are ready for that.

[13-Jul-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> you're bound to offend with the second one in this PC age, thankfully people are starting to wake up that PC is stifling human development

[13-Jul-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> @aFastHero lmao

[13-Jul-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> This goes out to all the women with vaginas

[13-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Yeah, its almost impossible to hurt my feeling.

[13-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> yes, singular.

[13-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> its a silencing strategy

[13-Jul-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Not really though, but I have no sympathy for those who get butthurt by the truth and no remorse if I'm the one delivering that truth.

[13-Jul-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> @AndronicusBass-Founder I just died from number 2 on that list; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI apologize‚Äù mean the same thing, except when you‚Äôre at a funeral.

[13-Jul-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> @jellysmash LOL! The way you worded that would likely offend as well in this age, but is so relevant!
