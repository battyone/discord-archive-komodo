[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @ArthurSk12 Your status is on dnd

[26-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> so discord sees you as not active

[26-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> can somebody remove me from it

[26-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> its annoying

[26-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I can ad you to no rain role

[26-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> ?explain soak

[26-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> i have it already

[26-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> ah nuts I forgot the part where it says your status must be GREEN OR YELLOW üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> for soaks

[26-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> oh... yes it does

[26-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> "it's all members currently holding the mentioned role who are either online or idle."

[26-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> "dnd" and "invis" do not get hit

[26-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Maybe if possible the no rain role can also prevent soaks

[26-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> yes that would too

[26-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> does it not?

[26-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I remove myself from those roles often to avoid mentions and somehow it automatically adds me back to those roles lol

[26-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> ^

[26-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> every time you level it reassess your roles needed

[26-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ermm...

[26-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> oh wait no each time it comes online it does

[26-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> it annoys me because i use discord for work too and all i see is notifications from this server when i check if somebody i work with msgd me

[dscrdeql] <adriana> üëå

[26-Jul-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I mean, for founders it's really only making it so we can give it all back, but still...

[26-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @adriana do you have the Agama or Komodo Ocean wallet? If so, you'll have an EQL address.

[26-Jul-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> @adriana your EQLI will be safe and sound with Tipsy until you are ready to set up a private wallet üòÉ

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Given that you don't do crypto, Agama. It's easy to use.

[26-Jul-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> "easy"

[26-Jul-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Komodo Ocean is a full node and requires some knowledge. Agama is meant for users.
