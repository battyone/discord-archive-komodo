[dscrdeql] <miles> Morning All - looks like some more EQLI was sold off overnight? Wonder if a few more wallets were involved and it’s still going on? I was able to request a withdrawal about 40 mins ago that is still waiting to go through.

[23-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Is it just the three of you guys known so far?

[23-Sep-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <digital bullion> I have now been able to initiate a withdrawl, it is currently being processed.

[23-Sep-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm going to check if I can withdraw the amount I have on there

[23-Sep-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They say it will be processed in like 8 minutes or so, not sure if that means the order to withdraw will be set or the actual withdraw

[23-Sep-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @SwimedDragon - I have had a withdraw waiting a couple of hrs now just FYI

[23-Sep-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok, hope it will still arrive today

[23-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Yeah - had ones take all day a few months back, but did one last week and it was done within minutes....so just need to hang tight and see

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hey all. Back in the city full connectivity 👌 bit to catch up on

[23-Sep-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I had upped my 2FA security over the past day on exrates, now it’s super annoying, they email me with a pin every time I log in, withdraw, or transfer coins

[23-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I will probably still withdraw most of my funds from there but may risk a little to keep trading some of my money makers on there

[23-Sep-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Sep-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Spent my night talking to exrates

[23-Sep-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Any positive results?

[23-Sep-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Did anyone lose a significant amount of coins ?

[23-Sep-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are they going to refund people that lost money?

[23-Sep-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Lol

[23-Sep-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Highly doubtful

[23-Sep-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We lost 1m coins from that episode

[23-Sep-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> I bet these exchanges claim hacks to keep peoples coins..

[23-Sep-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 490k were mine

[23-Sep-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol notice those sell orders over 1000 sats? They gone lol

[23-Sep-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> So you think i am right?

[23-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> @SwimedDragon going well here so far! just trying to help keep people updated on different things that have been going on. all these stupid hack attacks and shady crap are really starting to piss me off lol

[23-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Lol this all situation with that exchange is really sad

[23-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Yeah.. I stopped buyi g crypto

[23-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Really feeling bad for this project

[23-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i think both exrates and cryptohub were not hacked, but done by insiders. that is my opinion

[23-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> With all that happened now this situation on top of that

[23-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, it's sad that these things keep happening 😦

[23-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sometimes it makes me just want to leave crypto

[23-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> @linkara6669 that's what im saying

[23-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> same man

[23-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep but we already have this past that was behind tus and now this .

[23-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Had *

[23-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s an inside job on us in my opinion

[23-Sep-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Ha!!

[23-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I think it was done by insiders too

[23-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Knew it

[23-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i felt like cryptohub was shady a long time ago, so i refused to leave more than $5 worth of coins on there anymore. glad i had taken my near $200 off there

[23-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I called them out on it last night

[23-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im glad I managed to withdraw my btc a few days ago from there lol.

[23-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> glad i didn't have anything on exrates

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Now we are back at 17 sats level because of this

[23-Sep-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> couldn't afford to send anything there anyways till now, and now this all happens

[23-Sep-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
