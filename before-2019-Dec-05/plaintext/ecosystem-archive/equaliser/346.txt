[19-Aug-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> If the founders give the greenlight I'll go crazy in there 😃

[19-Aug-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What is it?

[19-Aug-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> SAFE coin is a friendly fork of KMD. SAFETrade is their trading platform and they are taking votes for coin listings.

[19-Aug-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> go to the discord and ask for :EQLI:  to be listed. worse that can happen is they say no 😃

[19-Aug-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> you have to send safecoin to vote.

[19-Aug-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> yes each SAFE =1 vote. it's like 0.032 cents usd

[19-Aug-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Do we have a channel that we allow Discord links in? Tipsy can be fed that info and respond accordingly guiding ppl there and also allowing them.

[20-Aug-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> #cryptotalk💹 maybe? @Founders have the say on that one

[20-Aug-18 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> People were abusing our initial leniency and so no more discord links. that can be open to change and what the other founders think

[20-Aug-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> anyone live in the US and have an android phone and want to make free bitcoin in their spare time?

[20-Aug-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I meet those criteria, what's the catch?

[20-Aug-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> no catch

[20-Aug-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Is this some bs mining in a mobile phone?  I tried it before...you have to be mining for weeks just to get the tiniest of tiny amounts of btc...because those places have a minimum amount to withdraw , so it'd take years to reach that amount

[20-Aug-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> no mining

[20-Aug-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> and no minimum. . but they only let you withdraw every 3 days

[20-Aug-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Ok, I'll send you my btc address, please send btc to it...then I'll believe

[20-Aug-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ohh god

[20-Aug-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> This is very common

[20-Aug-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ohh god. . yeah, I;m a total scammer

[20-Aug-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I should change my name to "total scammer"

[20-Aug-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Not saying you’re scamming anyone but it sounds suspicious as hell

[20-Aug-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You've been here a while, not saying you are scamming

[20-Aug-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Aug-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That can damage your phone from overheating and you dont make anything worthwhile.

[20-Aug-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> damage from what? you're not mining

[20-Aug-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> many apps that claim to mine bitcoin are trojans or malware.

[20-Aug-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I am speaking english right?

[20-Aug-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Aug-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
