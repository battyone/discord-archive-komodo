[dscrdeql] <Llama> I think I know why apollo got so many votes...

[18-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hows the day?????

[18-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> I joined their airdrop about 2 weeks ago because who doesn't want free tokens? 

I did everything that was required at the moment and thought that I was done. Now when I check the possible tasks that I can do, the only thing is to vote for them on KuCoin and it's Required...

[18-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Makes sense

[18-Jul-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> @Llama  good job

[18-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Jul-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tanya> thats interesting.

[18-Jul-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tanya> they had to hand out alot of coins then

[18-Jul-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> yeah

[18-Jul-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> 3000 APL for each vote... Can't wait for their price to tank

[18-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tanya> rofl

[18-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> circulating supply is 15 billion...

[18-Jul-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I thinks alps has already been considered a poopoocoin

[18-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sisana10> Sounds like the going to drop heavily.

[18-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Lol that kucoin competition is a total shitfest

[18-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Most votes are probably bought and the only party that will gain heavily from it is kucoin

[18-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Which is probably why they designed the competition in the first place :p

[18-Jul-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Seems like the case.

[18-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Ya seems every coin dev team hands out freebies for a "contest"...i've never been a fan of popularity contests

[18-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah rewards were given for those votes

[18-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> didn't like it

[18-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> its one thing to offer rewards for listing but giving rewards for each vote i didnt like plus there was multiple votes

[18-Jul-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cellulitis> i agree with that also

[18-Jul-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cellulitis> if you like a coin you don't ask for ransom

[18-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> most of the voters did it for free coins they most likely don't actually hold them

[18-Jul-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
