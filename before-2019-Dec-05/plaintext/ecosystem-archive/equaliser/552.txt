[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, I've bought in the last few days as well

[22-Feb-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> 24 hour volume is huge...3.2 million

[22-Feb-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hopefully our current buy walls will stay intact

[22-Feb-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wow, you're going to get a lot of rewards from the reward contracts with that amount üëç  I just can't see why the dumper(s) are giving that up

[22-Feb-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, if they accumulate I get that price is going up and down between a few sats all the time, but it's slowly getting lower and lower each time so I don't know why it's beeing sold at these prices again

[22-Feb-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I didn't buy 3.2 mllion.  I'm just saying that's the volume on STEX for the last 24 hours. I only bought a hundred thousand or so.

[22-Feb-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> wouldn't mind that much though...lol that'd be a pretty big bag...bit heavy for me

[22-Feb-19 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> I bought about a third of that volume

[22-Feb-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> good opportunity for people but still can't believe it dipped this low

[22-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sell walls are pretty big too, so even buying up wouldn't be bad if you got the funds

[22-Feb-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> 3.7m EQLI on sell orders, that was about 1m a week ago. Offcourse some orders are higher then others, but it's still a lot for sale

[22-Feb-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i been part of that buy wall too.
hard to figure out why anyone would be selling here

[22-Feb-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe someone had tens of millions?

[22-Feb-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> according to rich list, only top 7 holders have 10mm or more

[22-Feb-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hopefully not one of them

[22-Feb-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, he/she or they will regret it eventually

[22-Feb-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> most of the wallets on top are ours.

[22-Feb-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> biggest is the rewards wallet

[22-Feb-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> for the contracts.

[22-Feb-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think we will see a nice swing up soon.

[05-Jun-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> everyone  Security Alert: if you created or used your seed phrase with Agama please deinstall it, stop using it and immediately rotate your seeds and move all your coins out from there (to a different seed - which was NOT created with Agama) - if you know what you are doing please use either cold-storage (paper-wallets, offline storage, ...), the KomodoOcean wallet or komodo-cli. We will provide you an alternative desktop wallet very soon. If you need assistance please reach out to our support team: #community-support.
Our team will provide you all details of the incident in the coming days. 
This does only affect seeds that were used or created with Agama for Desktop, Mobile or Browser. Any issues please talk to the kmd team on thier discord

[05-Jun-19 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> other than that have a great day xD

[05-Jun-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yea I see only stex

[05-Jun-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> What about magnum wallet ?

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I use and recommend KomodoOcean. It's a full gui client. to start it with EQLI, use the following (with your own path) 

C:\Users\kevin\Desktop\komodo-qt-v2.0.15-rc2-g28-2\KomodoOceanGUI.exe -ac_name=EQL -ac_supply=500000000

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here

[05-Jun-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I put it in Stex

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> hopefully they wont disable trading soon lol

[05-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'd pull it back to KomodoOcean, just for safety.

[05-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Can y'all do me a favor and poke anyone you know who hasn't voted? So far it's looking like we'll continue as the team leaders, but not many people have expressed an opinion. Also, if y'all think we should, we can extend the deadline to make a decision.

[05-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Oh, as for the above, that's not a snipe at Stex. Just personal paranoia üòÑ Cryptopia hurt.  A lot.

[05-Jun-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I would say, just move ahead with this vote results and ask people to vote again in a few weeks, so if people missed they can alway's vote then

[05-Jun-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, most likely. Just trying to make it as transparent and fair as possible. I'm in this for the long haul, whether I lead or follow üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If those EQLI coins at stex are not safe, then I think price will be at 1 sat for long time üòÇ

[05-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They're running komodod. As long as the exchange stays solvent, they're safe enough. Just 'what's not in your hand', ya know?

[05-Jun-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I wish I hadn't lost all my BTC on Cryptopia. I'd run the market up a bit üòõ

[05-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea but atm we have those options only

[05-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wanted to say it can't go any lower, but I think exrates has eth/eqli only, so it can

[05-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I sent my funds to 5 different exchange

[05-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> imagine how I feel right now

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> right?

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> its  like you have your funds¬¥

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but you havent

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and besides my komodo werent sen to the safe address

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> were*

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I didn't lose a huge amount, but it was all I had outside of EQLI. All told around a hundred dollars between ETH, DOGE, and BTC. I really didn't expect Cryptopia to crash like that üòõ
