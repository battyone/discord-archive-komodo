[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I like real chillies but don't cook with them

[17-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> unfortunately the rest of the family don't like them

[17-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so I have to pour chilli flakes on to the meal after it's cooked

[17-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it never tastes as good though as cooking with real chillies in the meal

[17-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I tried a Habernero chilli a little while back

[17-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> tried a small amount raw

[17-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> OMG it was so hot

[17-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> no amount of water seem to take the heat out of my mouth or tongue

[17-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I probably should have had it mixed with food rather than raw

[17-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> be ok maybe with some really cold, cold beer to go with it.

[17-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it was a work at lunchtime

[17-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> couldn't just guzzle beer down

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> lol woooo you love those chillies

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> you wrote a whole soliloquoy on chillis hahaahah

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> you gotta

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> get those big chillis used in thai food and korean food

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's a type of rhyme isn't it?

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> or is it a style of poem

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> and then

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> just cut it open and dump it on your tongue

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> lol it's just a single speech by one character

[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> haha...I've heard of ghost chilies

[17-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> are they real?

[17-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I worked with some indian dudes

[17-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> they brought some of their lunch in for me each day

[17-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> they'd give me a bowl or plate of it adn a raw chilli

[17-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> the idea was that you eat a mouthful of the food

[17-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and then take a bite of the chilli

[17-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> they are real

[17-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> and they are hot

[17-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
