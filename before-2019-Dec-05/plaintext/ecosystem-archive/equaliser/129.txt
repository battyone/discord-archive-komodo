[dscrdeql] <x2maano> and how about eql?

[20-Jul-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> this morning when I checked and chatted, seemed like it was getting dumped a bit

[20-Jul-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> can u tell me about EQL in USD????

[20-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> EQL is at 0.1 USD on EXRATES

[20-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> go to EQL

[20-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> last time it is 0.5

[20-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> unforutnately they didn't setup the code correctly and it's EQL instead of EQLI

[20-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> ????

[20-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Not the end of the world, but you

[20-Jul-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> you'd think they'd get something like that right since its important

[20-Jul-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> and they spelled us Equalizer instead of Equaliser

[20-Jul-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, I commented they got the description wrong. 3 for 3 wrong - Description, Ticker and Spelling of Equaliser in their exchange

[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Morning

[20-Jul-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> How can an exchange have the description wrong, plus the ticker and spelling?

[20-Jul-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> morning all

[20-Jul-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Picture BarterDEX and HyperDEX like this: You are a stall in a market, you call out to people you are selling x amount of a coin for x amount of another coin, you are waiting for someone to come up to you and make the trade.

[20-Jul-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Morning @NWhiskeyTango

[20-Jul-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> almost all p2p trading is slow from my experience...kind of like fishing

[20-Jul-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> just waiting for a bit

[20-Jul-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> getting a buzz lol

[20-Jul-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> waiting for a bite

[20-Jul-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> but lots of scammy offers waiting for an unexpected whale

[20-Jul-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> People are getting concerned with centralised exchanges, DEX's are starting to gain traction. Binance is starting their own DEX I believe but if its a true DEX, time will tell

[20-Jul-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> i have been trying out a few. i am huge advocate of KMD but their dex is probably the only one i haven't tried out just because of the complaints i have seen people post online

[20-Jul-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @NWhiskeyTango hey morning

[20-Jul-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> lol ya pretty much @‚úåJellysmash‚úå

[20-Jul-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> @Catalyst not the best thing to try and sell on hyper

[20-Jul-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> because orders dont stay open forever

[20-Jul-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> hyper is a spotmarket

[20-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> well am not complaining I know how hyperdex works hehe  just saying the traffic or reach of hyperdex (great tech) is slow, they need to do more marketing üòÉ

[20-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> IT's the end of the world as we know it!

[20-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> they have "reasons" behind not marketing blah

[20-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> the sky keeps falling üò¶

[20-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> reason 1 blah.. reason 2 blah blah üòõ

[20-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> So many exchanges around these days

[20-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Popping up every week

[20-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> so sad news

[20-Jul-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> At least there are  options

[20-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Problem is low volume when a coin is spread across lots of exchanges

[20-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> ^ ya that and the value differences across those exchanges too

[20-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> could almost go and buy off one exchange and sell on another (had their been enough volume) for double profits
