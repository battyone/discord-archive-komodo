[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Wow 😮 20% in 2 hours

[20-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> More people that know about KMD will know about EQLI. People are still unaware that Komodo Platform has done over 110k atomic swaps

[20-Aug-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We'll get more people 😃 It probably takes time but still, people will find us eventually

[20-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Heck, even EQLI has done atomic swaps already 👌 😎

[20-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
