[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This is why I encourage questions about the project. You guys should be well informed and I’ll work to come up with a way to do that more frequently

[13-Sep-18 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> Hi all

[13-Sep-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> Thanks for the coffee

[13-Sep-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think great see some positive news

[13-Sep-18 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Surprised at how quickly the news had an effect on Exrates

[13-Sep-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <addi> Good morning everyone ☕

[13-Sep-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Seems  to show how important it is to have a constant steam of updates...even if those updates are relatively small...it just gives confidence.

[13-Sep-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @addi morning there

[13-Sep-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> eqli will have a flood of news soon it will be great

[13-Sep-18 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <zenbflor> @✌Jellysmash✌ @Francezzca22 hello have a good day

[13-Sep-18 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> in the long run its good things are taking a little more time... good news in a bear market doesn't really do anything these days lol

[13-Sep-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's good to see buy support coming up at 11 sats but I think that's someone from in here that sold higher and trying to load up more haha

[13-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Would be nice if you can load up more

[13-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't think I dare to take the risk of losing out on it haha. I'm happy with what I've bought earlier 😃

[13-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Noice

[13-Sep-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice that you have been able to fill your bags

[13-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Already a while ago 😃

[13-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I just hope the guy buying at 11 sats isn't gonna dump it at 20 again

[13-Sep-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good morning alll

[13-Sep-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> again

[13-Sep-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> ☕

[13-Sep-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good day to all

[13-Sep-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> He probably won't even be able to buy at 11 because no one would want to sell for that low price

[13-Sep-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Bought propertt

[13-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> oh  yea. i saw that higher too but i think he said he was going to an auction this morning so may not be on currently

[13-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i didnt hear the details yet

[13-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> can you share where @AndronicusBass-Founder ?

[13-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I look forward to the jump EQLI will take when the first building is built 👍🏻🤑

[13-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Soon we will say I told people to get it below 100 😃

[13-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> This is not only big for EQLI but also for cryptos as a whole

[13-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Once the first house is built the spotlight will be back

[13-Sep-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes agree

[13-Sep-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> this is the only project i know of in crypto that actually has a tangible utility

[13-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> anything below 20sats is really a steal. and by the end of the year ,like  @Combat Wombat says eventually anything below 100sats will be a steal!

[13-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yep

[13-Sep-18 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> it will happen the question is when

[13-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Everyone please report this spam tweet. 'report tweet'>>'report as spam' looks like an eth scam

[13-Sep-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I always report for other coins, us in the crypto community have to look out for others to fight back against scams tarnishing crypto
