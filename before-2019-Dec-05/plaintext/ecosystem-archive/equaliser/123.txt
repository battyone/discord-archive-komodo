[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, exrates goes to 9th decimal. A little hard to adjust your eyes 😄

[19-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> Cool back to work for me xDDDDDD

[19-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok, I was already counting it a few times haha

[19-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's been done on a few exchanges over the years. I can't think of any other at the moment, since Cryptsy went down. Just be careful on your trades 😄

[19-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> There's no technical limit to how far a crypto can be divided. 8 places was Satoshi's thing, but it's arbitrary.

[19-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Plus, an exchange is just a database. They can reconcile however they need to before it goes on the blockchain.

[19-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> @Cypher - Founder want to post that news in the Komodo ecosystem-announcements channel?

[19-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah i made a wrong order once lol lucky the exchange gave me the lowest sell order 😂

[19-Jul-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @Jonathan Not sure he's still on. But we'd love it to be there 😄

[19-Jul-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jul-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Honestly I don't have plans to sells now

[19-Jul-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> People who can get in cheap now and have the funds ready are so lucky 😃

[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Hey everyone! Good afternoon!

[19-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Need to scroll back and see what I've been missing for the past few hours

[19-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> ah, indeed 😃

[19-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> So I see I missed out on quite a few raindrops this morning. Can I earn XP any other way besides commenting in this General Channel?

[19-Jul-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> being active, chatting and also raining on people 👍

[19-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> the ?tip @Jonathan command will get you loads of XP 😉

[19-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> lol

[19-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> nice

[19-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> If I only have a hair over 1 EQL, raining is a little hard lol. Does chat in other channels count too?

[19-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Yep

[19-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Ok thought it was only counted here

[19-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its just not counted in tipsy rain channel, we dont encourage chat in there because if a conversation is going on then rains interrupt. That channel is only for rain anyway. No one is stopping chats in there, its just pointless

[19-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> 👍

[19-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> To rain or tip, best to do in the dm with the bot or in whatever channel I'm in?

[19-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> rain command in #tipsy-rain and tip. but I dont think tipping gets you xp

[19-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Ok. Thanks
