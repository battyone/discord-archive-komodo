[dscrdeql] <Kimmy> thank you

[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> I'm a terrible intern.

[02-Aug-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> Oh the bot doesn't work here.

[02-Aug-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ganjie> wow

[02-Aug-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> We're only listed on one exchange, as far as i'm aware?

[02-Aug-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah Soldat only exrates at the moment but also on barterdex and hyperdex i think but got no idea how to use those

[02-Aug-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> What's the collateral for a node?

[02-Aug-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> 50k?

[02-Aug-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> We are going to have to wait until the devs roll out nodes but i think its something around that range

[02-Aug-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> Ah. Nodes aren't released yet? What about staking?

[02-Aug-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Not that im aware of

[02-Aug-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> going to have to ask one of the founders for more information on that

[02-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> I see.

[02-Aug-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We don’t have staking

[02-Aug-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Masternode info will be released later on

[02-Aug-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> The PR mission is pretty close now? @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[02-Aug-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @CowboyCrypto looking forward to the masternode info

[02-Aug-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @SoldatChristi only listed on Exrates

[02-Aug-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's quite a good site, but a bit hard using a mobile

[02-Aug-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> I see

[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> How is the exrates orderbook looking atm?

[02-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I wonder how many people just bought the wales' stash at a couple satoshi and are now just selling them again at 10x which is still a ridiculous price...

[02-Aug-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm not sure, and I don't get that these offers are still around for these prices, it's crazy haha
