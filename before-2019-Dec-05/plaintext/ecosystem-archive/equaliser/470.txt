[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Let's try and get another 100

[08-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> If we want to have a chance of getting on binance we are gonna have to start building our community for sure

[08-Oct-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, the quickest most effective way these days is through social media, and regular media to the average person

[08-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> We will need to have buildings and the marketplace ready

[08-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, true...that would make a big difference

[08-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It will come

[08-Oct-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> it will take some time I reckon ..

[08-Oct-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but we will get there  eventually

[08-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> I consider myself lucky to be a patient person üòâ

[08-Oct-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> We're lucky we've gotten in early

[08-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I get these invites to various coins on discord every day...  I just delete them, but am wondering how those people can send an invite out to thousands of people???? Maybe we should do similar.

[08-Oct-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> I would guess maybe 1-2 out of 1k  actually become investors

[08-Oct-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If you don‚Äôt think we are working on other exchanges, you‚Äôd be wrong. But funding is where we fall short.

[08-Oct-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm hustling hard to get funds raised as I don‚Äôt want to have to choose between exchange and money to build
