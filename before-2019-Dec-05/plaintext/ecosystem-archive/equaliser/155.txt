[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> have not eaten it in over a year

[23-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> hungry jacks though üëå

[23-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and kfc

[23-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> mmmm

[23-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I find gourmet burger places make real tasty burgers, I am addicted to whoppers with cheese, in moderation though

[23-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah nothing like a good burger joint

[23-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> When I tried popeyes chicken and church's chicken, KFC seems not as good anymore. Still KFC is tasty and way better than going to mickyD's

[23-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> haha too many places to eat in aus

[23-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I want to try cubanos, need to find a place that does them

[23-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @AndronicusBass-Founder With the Agama wallet do you know how to keep EQL on it.. every time I login I have to activate it

[23-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> my funds are there no issues with that but I just have to active the coin each time to see it

[23-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That's correct. You can set a pin for it so you dont have to keep entering the private key or seed words

[23-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> how do you do that?

[23-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> settings?

[23-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ahh nice to reach home

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> hey jelly

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah, and encrypt seed. I will find the exact steps for you, it was a while ago when I did it

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I have the same when I log on to my agama wallet

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> have to do that activeate coin and enter private seed key each time

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> seems a bit odd

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ok thanks bass

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but it's there and the amounts are still there

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so works well

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just a bit curious

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> why

[23-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah I don't want to play around with it just in case i mess things up lol

[23-Jul-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe just how agama works

[23-Jul-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i don't mind doing it but if there is an easier way i'm up for that as well lol

[23-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> see how this goes. interface might not look exactly the same but the options should be https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/259850241/Create+New+Wallet+and+Encrypt+Seed+SPV

[23-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> except rather than creating new wallet just login to the wallet and go from the step to encrypt

[23-Jul-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> that page is a treasure trove of info as a KB on anything Komodo/Agama related

[23-Jul-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> sweet thanks bass will look at it after i eat

[23-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> what your smoker made from? I'll be makin one of my own one day. I would probably make a small dome as a smoke house

[23-Jul-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> and a woodoven

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Thanks, it seems I was on the correct one üòÉ I am alway's cautious when downloading stuff so I wanted to check if it was the correct one

[23-Jul-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah, and check the users that make the commits

[23-Jul-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @AndronicusBass hello Thor.. Well me and uncle Ben did try many times to setup that Node for EQLI but failed. We are stuck where the .exe file will be made. Help would be appreciated :) @NWhiskeyTango

[23-Jul-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Biomech is the best to answer if you would like to post that question in #supportüîß it will be attended to when the rest of the team are awake üòÉ

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Ah nice.. @NWhiskeyTango  see this please ^

[23-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there any difference between native and electrum mode?

[23-Jul-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've been thinking I should setup a node, not for the  mining but for knowing the process inside and out. I believe there are 2 ways but will need to confirm. One way I think doesn't require compiling. But native mode is with a local copy of the chain. I believe you have to be in native mode

[23-Jul-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Setting up a node allows you to mine for fees of transactions

[23-Jul-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I can't seem to select EQLI in native mode on barterdex but it does get added when I set up using electrum

[23-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> goto manage coins and remove equaliser if its there, then re add in native mode then close and open barterdex. that will load it on startup
