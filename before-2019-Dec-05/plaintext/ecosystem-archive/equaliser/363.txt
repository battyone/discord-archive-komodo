[23-Aug-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> While on Linked In making making more contacts and researching partnership opportunities, i came across a brilliant article, well worth a read

[23-Aug-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> "Fewer Lambos, more education"
"Rather, what I‚Äôd like to talk about is how the crypto community should use this moment to forget about price fluctuations and instead engage the world in a proper discussion about blockchain technology‚Äôs potential."

"Let‚Äôs have less ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù and ‚ÄúLambo‚Äù talk and more discussions about the promise of peer-to-peer exchange, smart contracts and decentralized applications."

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> morning @üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod

[23-Aug-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> how's it going guys

[23-Aug-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ‚òï

[23-Aug-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> for all those waking up now

[23-Aug-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> nice to get the brain into gear

[23-Aug-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> for the day ahead

[23-Aug-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Celebrating last week of vacation, my son is going to school next week.

[23-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I would say it's too bad he already goes next week, but on the other side, I'm happy with it haha

[23-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's really interesting @AndronicusBass-Founder

[23-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's exactly how it should be...people focussing on what blockchain can do

[23-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and how it can be applied to real world use cases to make something easier

[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and/or to help people in some sort of process

[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> a bit like Equaliser utilising smart contracts for title registry

[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> or equaliser coin for purchasing a house through equaliser

[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Too right üòÉ

[23-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think the days of having a crypto just for the sake of having it and it's only purpose is a store of value is gone

[23-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so many new shitcoins popping up every week

[23-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and it's rare to find any of them with a real world purpose

[23-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's surprising how many of them come out each week

[23-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> astounding rally

[23-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> really

[23-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think btc is king adn is a store of value but is getting rolled out into payment systems as an alternative to fiat

[23-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> which is all well and good

[23-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but do we need another 500 different types of coins that do the same thing?

[23-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> probably not

[23-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so what's the point to all these 'new' shitcoins?

[23-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> As well as a solution to the housing affordability crisis. I'm often having discussions on linked in about it but governments dont want to recognise there is an affordability crisis. I went to a talk at the University of Adelaide a couple months ago and experts agreed there is an affordability crisis

[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's why it's important to find those rare projects that will make a difference and back them

[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> governments don't necesssarily want to admit it

[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they think if they do then it'll make them look bad

[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and people woudl wonder if they knew about it then why didn't they fix it

[23-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm glad I found EQLI üòÉ Thanks again @Linkara6669-Mod üëç

[23-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You know we are also working towards our own assembly line? üëå

[23-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> really...is that an assembly line to mass produce houses?

[23-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> like a cookie cutter templates?

[23-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> to produce materials

[23-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's can really make the costs of building much cheaper

[23-Aug-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, I saw the video of producing the aircrete

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> looked like something that could be create on an assembly line

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and then just shipped out and assembled

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> my parents bought a kit home

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and got a builder to just assemble

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but that house came in a flat pack

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's a beautful house in tasmania

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> And we are constantly researching the refinement of processes to make it further cost effective

[23-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, that's the challenge

[23-Aug-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> if you can bring costs down a lot then it makes it more attractive to everyone...even governments

[23-Aug-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it'll also put pressure on traditional house building

[23-Aug-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> as they'll need to compete in price to the newly designed aircrete ones

[23-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> governments could really go for it as they can clear up huge areas of 'ghetto' style dwellings and replace with new estates of dome hosues

[23-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> for a fraction of the cost of traditional homes

[23-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm writing another article at the moment, and it's focussing on the building aspect of Equaliser

[23-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It would reduce the need for insulation and I recently learned about spray on instant insulation that uses harsh chemicals. The finished product isnt necessarily bad, its if it isnt done correctly it is poison. However, no one knows the long term health issues of it anyway

[23-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think that can really help people to understand the potential here

[23-Aug-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> if people can see how quick and easy it is to produce these homes then it'll get huge backing

[23-Aug-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> not just by people that want a home and want to buy one, but also investors that can see the far reaching potential

[23-Aug-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think the first builds speak for themselves if the media is on it üòÉ If the first house is build outside media attention and you bring in the media for the second build, they'll be able to witness every step of the build right?

[23-Aug-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> praying for

[23-Aug-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> it

[23-Aug-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We would invite the media otherwise get a videographer to join us to document it üòÉ

[23-Aug-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i think get your own video done the first time

[23-Aug-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> there's always teeethign problems frist time around

[23-Aug-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> learn first

[23-Aug-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> I agree. Build and do own video first round. Learn and improve then invite the media circus to a build event.

[23-Aug-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> Really intresting read üòÉ

[23-Aug-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> everyone will be waiting
