[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My plan is to establish a solid base or foundation here locally to build our business up. My plans include a warehouse to automate the block building process, a detailed shipping procedure for loading/unloading the walls and a full crew to assemble the homes on site.

[19-Jan-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Along with blocks I plan to manufacture trusses as well

[dscrdeql] <digital bullion> Is there any plans or discussions ongoing with Domegaia? I believe a partnership is listed as being an achievement of the project.

[19-Jan-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> At building stage we have advisory and consulting, this is important because there is very few in this space

[19-Jan-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Each building technique will be applicable in different climates and geographical locations. Still working on revised roadmap, marketing material and other partnership's and advisories

[20-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Another exchange isn‚Äôt going to fix our order books.

[20-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôd love to say I can make this all go up tomorrow but the reality is that I have put everything in this project and will continue to do so but it just takes time.

[20-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 1 house changes the game for all of us

[20-Jan-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm going to try a few things this week to see if I can expedite the process any.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôll be fine lol. I‚Äôve been talking to a lot of ppl this week about building

[21-Jan-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Thanks for coffee again  @!üëΩThorthüëΩ

[21-Jan-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Here's a couple for you ‚òï ‚òï

[21-Jan-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, I agree a new exchange won't change the order book. The whole crypto market is extremely depressed, and quiet. When it picks up, it will go crazy.

[21-Jan-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Gives some space to build a house....or two.

[21-Jan-19 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hey  @CowboyCrypto, is it common knowledge about purchasing the 4 acres?   Meaning can I tweet about it? Bit of a EQLI promo

[21-Jan-19 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I haven‚Äôt closed but we are going to the courthouse Thursday

[21-Jan-19 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> As long as it doesn‚Äôt have any outstanding liens on it I‚Äôm buying

[21-Jan-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I plan to build 4 homes on it if I do

[21-Jan-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once I‚Äôve got the process automated, I plan to hire and create jobs here locally and then just expand as we go

[21-Jan-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> sounds good cowboy don't burn yourself out

[21-Jan-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> hope you find some good help üëå

[21-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Eh I have a lot of it when I need it. I‚Äôm still trying to figure a lot of things out while running a business lol

[21-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i mean with running things lol

[21-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> one man armies need help

[21-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> üôå

[21-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it‚Äôs hard honestly.

[21-Jan-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need to get someone to run our social media so that we can start working they

[21-Jan-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That-*

[21-Jan-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah i think once things get rolling and the first house is built it should take off heaps of stress

[21-Jan-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôll take all of the mental strain off for sure

[21-Jan-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 5 homes produced will give us a solid footing for future expansions

[21-Jan-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> we all know you are working hard a bit too hard if you ask me

[21-Jan-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Got to buddy

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nobody is gonna work harder for my dream than me

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> just concentrate on the first house for now.. once that is built we got some liquidity and we can push the news

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> dont even think about the other houses for now

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> or the resort

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That‚Äôs the plan

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm going to try a single pour wall this week

[21-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 8ft x 4ft

[21-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If I can pour 4 of those a day then I‚Äôll have walls ready to be put in place in no time

[21-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah that would be nice you will figure out the right combo

[21-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs a bunch of testing. I‚Äôve done soooo much of it lol

[21-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve messed this up about every way possible

[21-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thats good

[21-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Which is great if you ask me

[21-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if you mess up heaps you learn what not to do

[21-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> once you have messed up enough you will figure out the right way to do it

[21-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> then boom boom boom

[21-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My friend owns a concrete company so we‚Äôve been discussing a potential partnership

[21-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
