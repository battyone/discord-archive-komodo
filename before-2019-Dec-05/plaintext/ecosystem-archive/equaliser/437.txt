[17-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> up now to do some weights

[17-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's getting really light in the mornings now

[17-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> this time a month ago and it was pitch black

[17-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> now the birds are cranking up their song earlier and earlier

[17-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Days are getting longer over there I guess, there about to start getting shorter here

[17-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea i love long daylight hours

[17-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's one of the things I don't like about winter, the short daylight hours

[17-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and the dark and cold all the time

[17-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I love summer

[17-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> When I commuted to work I hated it too, working from home though is not so bad 😃

[17-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Fall is my favorite season

[17-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> for me its the opposite summer is ending

[17-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> altough temperatures are still quite warm

[17-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> hello @✌Jellysmash✌ @CowboyCrypto- Founder  😄

[17-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> crpyto taking another hit nothing new 😄

[17-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s just a thing lol

[17-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’ll pull out

[17-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep definetly

[17-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> I've stopped worrying about the markets because ALL of the big boys are gearing up to go crypto. The markets will go up no question. Consider what we all saw over the new year a preview of what is to come. Right now its about backing solid projects with real direction and use ;)

[17-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Ppl keep underestimating how long its actually taking to get started. Impatience has blinded to the fact that Romecoin wasnt mined in a day lol

[17-Sep-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> haha 👍

[17-Sep-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lmao

[17-Sep-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You’re ate up bro

[17-Sep-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I thought all coins were mined in the genesis block

[17-Sep-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Just the first two keys pairs... but they got corrupted by a 100% attack and so a new chain was forked.

[17-Sep-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> I wonder what kind of coin religions will exist in the future with lore of the premine days of years past.

[17-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep exactly my thoughts Im a bag holder and I will be for the next years I will sell obviously a few for a profit but most of my bags are gonna stay loaded 😃

[17-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @tipsy_dev | auscoi yes interesting

[17-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Ithink most of us are bag holders for sure

[17-Sep-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I'm holding it for long term

[17-Sep-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> At some point I'm going to sell like 1/5  or 1/6 off to get some profit, to enjoy life with my family, but the rest will be holding long term

[17-Sep-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghøst> good night

[17-Sep-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> My formula works so far. Buy something,  immediately set 10% to sell at 10x the purchase price. Sit back and hodl 90% pure profit once that 10 clears, which in these early days is not hard.

[17-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Thanks to that giant rush we had at the beginning of this year most of my actual initial investment has been paid back and while I'm not exactly rolling in it with profits at the moment everything I do have to play with is pretty much free of charge at this point.

[17-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I want to get my initial investment back but offcourse enjoying some profit too. I was unlucky to join a bit late and as a newbie

[17-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> What's funny is people still consider this late. You're so early man.

[17-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> You might not be Alpha test early but you're definitely beta test early

[17-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, true, but it just feels like I'm late

[17-Sep-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Yeah and when I invested early last year I felt like I was super late to the party too.

[17-Sep-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There are cycles.

[17-Sep-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You have to be able to spot the cycle and capitalize on them. If ever you are in a position where taking 60% of your investment out could change your life, do it. Taking profits is the single most important part of this game.

[17-Sep-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> That is true! I was at least smart enough to take enough profits to pay myself back haha!

[17-Sep-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm having that in mind now too 😃 But it's too bad I bought some things on a price that was too high

[17-Sep-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I've learned from it

[17-Sep-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And I've said it before, even if I'd lose all my money on crypto, it is way more fun experience then buying lottery tickets

[17-Sep-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Never buy when everyone else is :-)

[17-Sep-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Getting late here, gotta go to sleep 😃

[17-Sep-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> See ya tomorrow everyone

[17-Sep-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Have a good night!

[17-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Later

[17-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m workin on a damn Chrysler 300

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Time for me to clock in but first ☕

[17-Sep-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Clapped as much as I could!! those are the first types of masternodes that I truly feel interested in amazing stuff!

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Just read the medium article about how the staking will work...

[17-Sep-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Interesting

[18-Sep-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> So setting say 100k coins aside for 90 days will give you an extra 10k coins at the end of it? Where do those coins come from?

[18-Sep-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it wont give you 10k in 90 days.

[18-Sep-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will give you 10% apr return over 90 days.

[18-Sep-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and those coins come from a fund that we created with unsold coins from dICO
