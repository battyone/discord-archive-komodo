[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> For sure, I do about 3-4 liters of water and sweat it out.

[06-Dec-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm sure sydney will have its hot days this summer...it always does

[07-Dec-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I don't miss the muggy weather when I used to live there. Thankfully there's cloud here today so the bite from the sun is less extreme.

[07-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Crazy days in the crypto market these last few weeks...including today...
BTFD

[07-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think we have another few days of drops first though

[07-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s a great opportunity to get bitcoin

[07-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Then buy btc, and use that to buy bags of EQLI

[07-Dec-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Set buy orders with it lol

[07-Dec-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Let’s shake out these dumpers and get our numbers up!

[07-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm looking forward to getting rid of all the weak hands.

[07-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Soooo much coming 😁

[07-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> aren't we also expecting a christmas dip like the previous years?

[07-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> don't know how much more brutal it can get lol

[07-Dec-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, it's been very brutal...but I think we have another 5 days of drops, till RSI gets down to oversold levels for btc

[07-Dec-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah what about Christmas dip

[07-Dec-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> You expecting that as well?

[07-Dec-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Or Chinese new year dip

[07-Dec-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Lol or is that all bs

[07-Dec-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Or will we have a little rebound soon then the dip?

[07-Dec-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> 🤔

[07-Dec-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think mid Jan we will see a wave of volume.

[07-Dec-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m looking at 2800 range though

[07-Dec-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah we will see I'm expecting next year to be good seeing as heaps of big things happening

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> If I buy more cryptos it will be after Christmas I'm worried there will be another dip at that time

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Could be massive in comparison to 2017

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Seeing as it's supposedly happened every year

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I look at what I think can be done long term

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> My portfolio is no longer a portfolio

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> It's dead lol

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol join the club

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Haha what kind of gun is that

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Water

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Water pistol

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> See that's how dead my portfolio is

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 😂

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Don't even need a real gun to kill it

[07-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> 😂 😂

[07-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m looking at the opportunity presenting itself.

[07-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Buying quality coins cheap

[07-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah plenty of good options now

[07-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> But I've said that before

[07-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yep

[07-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Me too

[07-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> So I think I'll stick to after Christmas unless we go way below 3k before then I'll prob buy in again

[07-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s investment not get rich all the time

[07-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I would

[07-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> This year the bank would of been a better option for me lol

[07-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> But yeah long term holds

[07-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol wait til you see this streamlined building system we have in place

[07-Dec-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I don’t care what the price of EQLI is currently.

[07-Dec-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Oh I'm very excited for next year

[07-Dec-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I know what’s going to happen when we start selling houses

[07-Dec-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Eqli and kmd and anything build on kmd lol

[07-Dec-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I think I'll be sticking to mainly kmd and eqli

[07-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Arrr and Verus are great projects too
