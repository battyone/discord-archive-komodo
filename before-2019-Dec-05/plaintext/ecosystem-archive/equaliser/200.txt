[dscrdeql] <Llama> I switched from galaxy to iPhone a month ago

[26-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Sorry about your luck.

[26-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> Well my galaxy was the slowest thing ever

[26-Jul-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Lol

[26-Jul-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Eh. I like the way iPhones look, but my cheap Android burner outperformed the i7 by leaps and bounds. Lucky the iPhone was a company phone...

[26-Jul-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> I like galaxy but I only use a few apps and they are better on iphone

[26-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> the only issue with android is it's easy to cake with useless apps that clog the memory. I often close all apps when not in use, only turn on radio protocols when i need to use them and reboot every day. my galaxy s7 is as fast as I got it on day one over 2 years ago üëå

[26-Jul-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Plus with root, you can eliminate all the crapware and have twice the memory...

[26-Jul-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Jailbreak probably does that, too. But it's much harder to do.

[26-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Hey

[26-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, apparently jailbreaking gets more difficult as new generations of iphones come out

[26-Jul-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Personally I would love a non-google linux mobile os that can work with many phones and can still utilise all onboard hardware.

[26-Jul-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i have an S7. its fast and im not connected to any of the other apple devices at home. need some privacy sometimes

[26-Jul-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Andy, if you got an Android you don't mind risking, put Ubuntu on it.

[26-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah I was looking into ubuntu last year. they dropped the os and now its community driven

[26-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> looks nice though from the screenshots

[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> not sleeping enough man

[26-Jul-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> insomnia sucks

[26-Jul-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> melatonin helps me for that üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I get enough, just time it to be awake most of the same time as the others then sleep and wake up to man the fort

[26-Jul-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> i have insomnia too so i totally know how it goes. bad sleeping habits turned into insomnia for me

[26-Jul-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> makes sense

[26-Jul-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> but its winter here and i havent been outdoors much lately

[26-Jul-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Sometimes you can take advantage of it though

[26-Jul-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> learn something new to pass the time.

[26-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You cant shut down the mind, do you try any natural remedies like herbal tea?

[26-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> oooh, melatonin, that I forgot about.

[26-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Yep @AndronicusBass-Founder they make gummy versions of them. Combine that with a good book to read and I'm out like a light üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> gummies work quicker

[26-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I used to order online tablets from the U.S, its low dosage in aus over the counter. Cheers for the info, Il'l try the gummies

[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Home is where the heart is

[26-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> Only one of the greatest blockchain projects out there. Buying Equaliser gives no one claims or rights to already established property however, rather the opportunity to purchase property we build by paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value. (re @DIPetre: Wtf is this shiet?)

[26-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> Equaliser is a Blockchain based solution that aims to provide affordable, strong, energy efficient and beautiful homes and accommodation which will contain a title registry, proof of ownership and smart contract functionality

[26-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> Equaliser won't contribute to already inflated established property market prices and a fraction of profits are used for helping those in natural disasters and also subsidies for some that need assistance owning a home.

[26-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The first thing that I read about that got me into crypto was something called smart contracts. I was sold then and there

[26-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> march 2017

[26-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I still HODL everything even through the bull market. Even if people sold at the peek, it was still too low

[26-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Im not a trader so I dont stress on daily prices

[26-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> I got in early may this year, love it and can't really see myself going back to traditional companies

[26-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> My last job paid well but i was so unhappy, I got burned out. Needed a change and found the opportunity of a lifetime to help make a change in the world

[26-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I agree, in addition, I think traditional companies rarely treat staff well, more like numbers

[26-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Hell yeah @AndronicusBass-Founder
