[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> good you're at uni

[18-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Myke500> Always rainy in eqli  🌧

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> holy sht....just saw on exrates

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> eqli up to 70 sats

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I went to bed and it was at 26 and I bought a little

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> wow

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> now your 3x richer

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> some good buying action

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes for sure

[18-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> haha...only relative though

[18-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> meaning only if sold..which i wouldn't do at 70 sats

[18-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> worth so much more than that

[18-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so much potential

[18-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It'll go to 100 sats quickly I reckon as there aren't any big sell orders really

[18-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats what we were all talking about earlier

[18-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cryptic1> @Cypher - Founder thanks for the rain@

[18-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cryptic1> !

[18-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> now that the whale is done and most of the coins are tightly held its going to be like a vacuum up

[18-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hopefully those masternode rewards lock up are here soon so we might even get some more buying volume

[18-Sep-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yep it will be expensive for a masternode soon

[18-Sep-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Thanks for the soaking 😃

[18-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I like where we are holding in sats value

[18-Sep-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes agreed. i put a few bids in as it looks to me like the bottom is in

[18-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> still need to remember not many people have heard about this coin

[18-Sep-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> when the name EQLI becomes more known we would wish we could come back to these times and get more lol

[18-Sep-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and we have a team that will do everything they can to succeed

[18-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep that’s completely true .

[18-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Glad to be part of this and have to thank the foundation !

[18-Sep-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> haha..yes, like a vacuum up @c2k

[18-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> morning!

[18-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> EQLI - you can buy a house, but you can also do it reasonably well

[18-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> who here has 100k equi?

[18-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think that everyone here that bought on exrates was able to get that at least haha

[18-Sep-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you have 100k?

[18-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Time to sleep, goodnight everyone

[18-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Goodnight @SwimedDragon - sleep well

[18-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> Nope eqli is one of my bigest and only have 3k :/

[18-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye its weird lol

[18-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> as long as I match Exrates I'm happy haha

[18-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> because the only active change its exrates
