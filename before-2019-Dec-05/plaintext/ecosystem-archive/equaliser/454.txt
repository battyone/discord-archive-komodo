[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> he's trying to redesign roofs there

[20-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Roofing is easy. Cement tiles that overlay with a cable tie-down system that locks the roof joices in, through the walls, and snchors to the foundation. 200mph winds sustained easily...boom...where's my ‚òï

[20-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> do you have contact emails or something like that @dolladollaiv . maybe the team canfigure out a way to approach these peopole

[20-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> nah, but i can find them

[20-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> cant hurt. the more exposure and relevant contacts the better

[20-Sep-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im building the first one with a metal roof as it is inexpensive and can be done by a team of 2 people.

[20-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> domes wont need roofs

[20-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Sep-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Here's Del Rio's company website. cant access at work..www.delrioarquitectos.com

[20-Sep-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> With the recent flooding on the east coast with hurricane Florence there were people that tried to ‚Äúget to higher ground‚Äù by going in their attic and then had to be cut out when the water got too high. Domes would make that hard right?

[20-Sep-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Install a hatch. Not really

[20-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Installing a hatch in a typical roof would be like "like what are the chances i ever have to use that?"...in a dome it would seal better imo

[20-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> "More than half of Puerto Ricans don't have title to their properties." Damn. cant even get fema assistance without proof of ownership

[20-Sep-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Hard to get a title when you don‚Äôt have permits for a building that you threw together

[20-Sep-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Yupp. "The government admits it takes about four years for the average person to get the permits they need. They usually bypass this, construct their homes, and say sorry and then get the permits."

[20-Sep-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they are air tight if you do it right

[20-Sep-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> esp monolithic

[20-Sep-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> But if the water level got too high and someone was inside there is no way to cut them out right?

[20-Sep-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah it has windows and usually a skylight.

[20-Sep-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> where a hatch could be placed.

[20-Sep-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> There is always a way. Think... üëä ‚úã ‚úå üòÇ

[20-Sep-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but here's the thing, and honestly it will have to be tested extensively before i ever attempt it publicly, but aircrete floats.

[20-Sep-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if you had a continuous pour form that included subflooring you could essentially attach an anchor line below much like a dock has.

[20-Sep-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> where you can let line out as water rises and tighten it as it receeds

[20-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> #trivia

[20-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That sounds tricky, awesome but tricky.

[20-Sep-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Gonna get seasick in your own house though haha

[20-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> seastedding is nothing new

[20-Sep-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> nothing we are doing is new really except the 3d printing end of things when we get there.

[20-Sep-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we are merely using ideas that people often overlook.

[20-Sep-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Well I look forward to owning a 2500 sq ft monolithic dome on a lake üëçüèª

[20-Sep-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> which lake thats the question üòÑ

[20-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Haven‚Äôt decided yet, a lake house up in the mountains, or at least hills, has always been my forever home plan

[20-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> nice to have a plan @Zach

[20-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> good to get onto Peer2Group

[20-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that was good voting by everyone

[20-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Resorts are kind of my wheelhouse lol

[20-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> what do you mean by 'wheelhouse'?

[20-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Seriously good! I am so happy that we are getting added

[20-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it means that it is something I am very good at.

[20-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> You having knowledge of timeshares should pour over into this space pretty well

[20-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have over 15 years in the resort game, I was a national trainer for timeshare sales.

[20-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I started doing that when i was 16 years old.

[20-Sep-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I was a top sales rep at Wyndham, Bluegreen, and Grand Crowne. Then went to marketing because I started hating sales. Made marketing director by 23

[20-Sep-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> dang

[20-Sep-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah I would never really go back to that, because I hated it even though the money was great.

[20-Sep-18 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> my life fell apart when I was around 26, was homeless for a while. worked my way back and most importantly never missed a visit with my kids ever. Im proud of that part lol

[20-Sep-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> family is #1

[20-Sep-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, family is the most imporotant thing

[20-Sep-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> always. even in the worst of my life I never lost that sight. I see alot who do around me daily.

[20-Sep-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Sometimes I wonder why people ever have kids... but at the end of the day my family is everything

[20-Sep-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That would have been a perfect comment to level up on.. haha

[20-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> hahaha

[20-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah I do everything for my family, i sure as hell dont do all of this for me.

[20-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if I were doing it for me I would be at the gym around noon everyday and on the lake until about midnite fishing

[20-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> And with family there is no gym and no fishing

[20-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Haha

[20-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> oh theres still fishing.

[20-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we go fishing on the weekend.

[20-Sep-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just saw some pump of XRP

[20-Sep-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> what I was suprised about was about a month ago I saw a list of top 10 crypto coins

[20-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Ripple?

[20-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> top coins in 2013 adn XRP was around number 3 or 4

[20-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the top was btc

[20-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> all the other coins that were listed in that top 10 of 2013 from memory, are dead now

[20-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> xrp is ripple ...yea

[20-Sep-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> seems like there's a pump on ripple at the moment

[20-Sep-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> could push past ETH

[20-Sep-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Dang it‚Äôs way up

[20-Sep-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Past ETH? I doubt that haha

[20-Sep-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> judging by the fact that it's been in top 10 for last 5 years, I was suprised but shows it has some resilience

[20-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I reckon EQLI can give it a run for its money

[20-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> GO EQLI

[20-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea

[20-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ü§ò

[20-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I would be quite wealthy if EQLI passes XRP

[20-Sep-18 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> All of us

[20-Sep-18 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
