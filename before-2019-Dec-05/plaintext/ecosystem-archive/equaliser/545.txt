[25-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmmm, first time I've seen such a big sell wall at only 20 sats. Hope some people see this as a good chance to still load up some cheaply, they'll regret this within a year if they don't take it

[25-Jan-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> 🍷

[25-Jan-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol im tryin to get more coins to buy it

[25-Jan-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've got little funds to buy about 13k coins but I'm hoping the guy tries to dump lower

[25-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> im waiting on the people to get tax refunds in and then I should sell alot of cars.

[25-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if we combine a dump with that, it'd be great.

[25-Jan-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> There's only 1.1m EQLI on the sell book so I assume that the guy dumping still has more to putt on sell, but it's nice to see he's getting to these lower amounts, considering he first putt sell walls at 150 and 100 sats

[25-Jan-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So even if you get to sell a lot of cars, don't buy up at much higher prices as it will only satisfy the guy and make him set up his other orders at higher prices

[25-Jan-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @CombatWombat happy Australia day to all

[25-Jan-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jan-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Good day for the beach

[25-Jan-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's usually packed on Australia day though around Sydney

[25-Jan-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, I saw that sell wall on stex. Surprising, but probably just a scared ex hodler who couldn't take the bear market any longer.

[25-Jan-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, he she will regret it for sure when the Bulla are back

[25-Jan-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah weather is much better in Melbourne today

[25-Jan-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Deadtorights> Good morning- Hows it going?

[26-Jan-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hi guys, good morning  @Deadtorights  @!👽Thorth👽

[26-Jan-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Went to Chinese restaurant last night...was so thirsty afterwards

[26-Jan-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think they must use MSG, that's why tastes so good.

[26-Jan-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕ ☕ ☕

[26-Jan-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Deadtorights> Good

[26-Jan-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Jasmine tea with the meal is always good with Chinese

[27-Jan-19 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, maybe teh jasmine tea would counteract the MSG a bit

[27-Jan-19 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> stay more hydrated then drinking red wine

[27-Jan-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <digital bullion> Curious as to the new revised timeline for rewards contracts. 

"Rewards contracts are coming into action by block 205,000" AndronicusBass - Founder

[27-Jan-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Will have to wait for cowboy to give us a revised timeline

[27-Jan-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <digital bullion> At least an update for the community on the progress if any towards their actual implementation I think would be fair.

Just saying they are "coming" means nothing.

[27-Jan-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <digital bullion> If it were true that they are going to be implemented at xxx,xxx block height then we sbould be creating some buzz as a community, currently on STEX there is almost zero volume, the rewards contracts may incentivise people to look into EQLi, it is a great incentive. It is a big part of the reason why I hold Komodo, for the rewards.

If there is issues with the implementation then there should be communication with the community, in my opinion and not just further empty promises, vague timelines and fluffy ideas, that dont manifest in concrete results. If DEV work needs to be done then surely we could all put some funds together to make it happen.

Just my opinion, to which I am entitled to as a concerned investor.

Missed deadlines and empty promises do not build confidence in my opinion.

[27-Jan-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I agree let's see what cowboy has to say

[27-Jan-19 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and yes your opinion is welcome and you have every right to have one and be concerned

[27-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Crypto conditions became active at block 205000 where contracts can then be implemented which we are arranging. The current markets have been hard on all projects, much worse than anyone thought.
