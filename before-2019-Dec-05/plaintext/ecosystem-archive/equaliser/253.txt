[01-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I figure bleed him long enough, he'll go away.

[01-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Cuz anything I buy at these rates is gonna be put back at REAL prices. If at all. No reason to dump like that.

[01-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> fingers crossed here

[01-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> my wallet seems to be working ok. but exrates taking 10hrs to send out EQL is beyond ridic 🤐

[01-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> This time, that might have been my fault 😄

[01-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I asked them to review the wallets and be dead certain that they were on the right chain.

[01-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I won't take the hit for their general slowness, but this one was probably just caution.

[01-Aug-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ah, well at least theyre slow for a good reason then

[01-Aug-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I'm not able to trigger any buys/sells on hyperdex still. Anyone have any luck?

[01-Aug-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Anyone have about 3 btc they wanna throw at this? 😂

[01-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not a bad idea. You'd kill the dumper's ability to dump 😄

[01-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I took my hyperdex trades down while we were resolving the fork, haven't relaunched it yet. Gimme about ten minutes and there'll be stuff 😄 Don't aim for exrates price, I'm not that foolish.

[01-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> You got one cigarette before I do anything 😄

[01-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Important: If you have used any previous beta version, you need to delete your trade history as this version has an incompatible format. Right after opening this version, go to the "Debug" menu and choose "Delete Trade History".

[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Wanted to put that disclaimer first

[01-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> So I need to clear all trades and update, then put them back?

[01-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> For that, download install launch. The 1st thing to do when it launches, login and go clear trade history. It will then restart

[01-Aug-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> A'ight folks, @NWhiskeyTango found that Hyperdex does not hold orders until cancelled as Barterdex does. So I am rebuilding the books in Barterdex. I'll have KMD/BTC/LTC up shortly, and I'm working on Tether and BCH as well.

[01-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Go long 🏈 FTW

[01-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Learning some things about barterdex today.

[01-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Here's one I didn't know, and might be useful for y'all.

[01-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> To use Tether, you have to add ETOMIC first. Bdex treats USDT as an ERC20 token.

[01-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's not, but if it works 😄

[01-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats a new one...interesting.
