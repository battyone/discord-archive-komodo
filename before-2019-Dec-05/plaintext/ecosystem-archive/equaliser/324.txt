[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Hey I was just talking to my wife about EQLI and she said she saw something on TV about a company that is looking to build homes with 3D printers ect and starting in Puerto Rico. She couldn't remember the company, by chance did EQLI do an interview that would have made it onto TV?

[16-Aug-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Thanks Steve.. :) I think @AndronicusBass  would know what Steve is asking just 2 comments above. And if has happened let us know of the good news

[16-Aug-18 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @Faisal I hope it was them she heard about, that would be great news

[dscrdeql] <blademaster> This concept will go really quick if the government space agency looked into it and if feasible, they will implement it for the moonbase

[16-Aug-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> Trump will definitely love the idea. Someone go tell trump about eql

[16-Aug-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> For the moonbase project,man power is more costly to build homes than robots. So 3d printers there would be the cheapest method

[16-Aug-18 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> moonbase is funny with PR in it's current state

[16-Aug-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> but you're not wrong

[16-Aug-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
