[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> and then coconut milk added

[04-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> potatoes in it where perfect

[04-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Slow cooked is awesome. I have a tefal cook for me pressure cooker it does well but then it's good to transfer to a pot and reduce the liquid for a bit

[04-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> yea, that sounds pretty decent

[04-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> we've cooked for hours in a cast iron casserole dish.

[04-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You should try yuca we had it in Puerto Rico I like it better than potato. And I bloody love potato

[04-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Cast iron is good

[04-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> just looked up yuca...brazilian root

[04-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> can you buy it local...in sydney?

[04-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> so it looks like the xp required has increased.. I remember when @!!!üëæ üëΩ Thorth üëΩ üëæ!!! was going up to level 12 it was 1260 points and now I can see going from level 8 to level 9 is also 1260

[04-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> markets maybe

[04-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> yea, maybe the markets

[04-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> can't really get to the markets

[04-Jul-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Not sure, i dont think the xp has changed, I can check.

[04-Jul-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!üëæ üëΩ Thorth üëΩ üëæ!!!> aaa????  what si with me ???

[04-Jul-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!üëæ üëΩ Thorth üëΩ üëæ!!!> üòê

[04-Jul-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> just wondering if the number of xp required for each level has gone up

[04-Jul-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> when you were going to level 12 I think it was around 1260 xp, same as for me going from level 8 to level 9

[04-Jul-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I could be wrong though.

[04-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!üëæ üëΩ Thorth üëΩ üëæ!!!> well üòê  no ideea :-?? never ask myself üòÇ

[04-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> not that it matters.....just wondering

[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> What are the benefits of XP
