[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> rush and more rush

[24-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Morning @‚úåJellysmash‚úå - when I was in school it was called "rapid prototyping" lol

[24-Oct-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Ive been wondering.. will yall be building basements?

[24-Oct-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Jonathan yes I've heard of that...agile is meant to be the big alternative to waterfall method.

[24-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm seeing more and more workplaces adopting agile practices now.

[24-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> In IT, most places say they do agile

[24-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But most places aren't really doing it properly or even know how to do it.

[24-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It can be a big change to the traditional approach

[24-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> And it doesn't have to be constrained to IT development either

[24-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Yeah I only worked at one place that still did waterfall, it was a really large project though with 100+ people. Agile can get disorganized really quick if it isn't done right

[24-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've heard the US dept of defense use it now for adults their development

[24-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Jonathan interesting to hear that

[24-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, I think the scrum masters need to be good and keep it all together

[24-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Otherwise you get teams doing whatever they want outside of the process

[24-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Yep, I was on a few teams that didn't have one and still said they were agile/scrum lol

[24-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lol....a lot of places do that, which is why it doesn't work properly

[24-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I did the scrum master certification about 10 months ago

[24-Oct-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Sprints would end up pushed back or poor quality sent out, and the "wish lists" never worked out

[24-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm still doing developemt but have been filling in the scrum master role until they hire a new one.

[24-Oct-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Nice, always thought about getting that

[24-Oct-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It takes the right person for that role, need to be assertive but know how to facilitate

[24-Oct-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Absolutely

[24-Oct-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I just did a 2 day course and then did the exam at the end of it...pretty easy...but I've been practicing scrum at work for last 4 years

[24-Oct-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Nice

[24-Oct-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> What language do you develop in?

[24-Oct-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> C# dotnet, Sql server

[24-Oct-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
