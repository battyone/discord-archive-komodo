[26-Jul-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> I don’t mind a bit of fishing myself. It’s good for the soul

[26-Jul-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Totally agree, very peaceful

[26-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Absolutely.

[26-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And every fisherman knows you always catch something. Sometimes it's just a buzz, but that's enough 😄

[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Hi @Biomech

[26-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Sorry, man. Gotta supress them notifications. We're all 'round the globe 😛

[26-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Yato [EQS]> Thank you

[26-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> I saw twit about masternode on twitter

[26-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> 😂

[26-Jul-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Tweet*

[26-Jul-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We've been leaning that direction, but no solid plans as yet as to when or exactly how we'll set it up. Meantime, KMD platform has made some very interesting innovations in a similar vein, we're looking at it very closely. Perhaps tying smart contracts and masternodes together in some fashion for title registration.

[26-Jul-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Sounds awesome

[26-Jul-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The problem with having a very creative team is where to draw the line 😄

[26-Jul-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Pocketmom go(Graphic Designer)> Thanks

[26-Jul-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> A lot of coins are doing the mastenode thing these days

[26-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> How many coins do you think you'd need for a mn?

[26-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> It will be great when you guys have it up running. Great job

[26-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Actually what's the max supply of EQL coins?

[26-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah. It has some good advantages, both from the view of chain stabilization and price stabilization, but we don't want to make ours "cookie cutter". We want our masternodes to be somewhat unique in their function.

[26-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 500 million. Plus about 20 coins that were made for testing.

[26-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Ok, thanks

[26-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> How many coins do you reckon you'd set up a mn for?

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm not prepared to speculate on that right now.

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Lol

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We're talking about it 😛 There is a wide range.

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Really, not even a very rough guestimate?

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Something like 1000

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Or above

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not that low.

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> 5k

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 100k perhaps?

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't want to undercut the team without consulting them.

[26-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> we haven't come to an agreement on it.

[26-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But what's your own thinking I the matter in terms of numbers?

[26-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Just curious

[26-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 100K

[26-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But that is my personal bias. Don't take it as holy writ 😄

[26-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, kinda what I was thinking of

[26-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> 🤔 😂

[26-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just be patient there are a lot of details to iron out

[26-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ganjie> wow

[26-Jul-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cherubz> Ok

[26-Jul-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We wanted to give everyone some insight to our plans but nothing is set in stone

[26-Jul-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Ok

[26-Jul-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hope that clears things up

[26-Jul-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> My thought is that title registration has to be approved and recorded by a masternode, which would carry a reward for the MN owner. But again, nothing has been solidified yet 😄 We have a LOT of ideas, and we listen to y'all suggestions, too.

[26-Jul-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> And congrats with your partnership with Domegaia founder Hajjar Gibran. I know there a lots more coming

[26-Jul-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @Biomech interesting about using the mn for title registration....you guys are really developing a truly unique coin

[26-Jul-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We're certainly trying 😄

[26-Jul-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> So many coins out there are the same...but you EQLI will be very different

[26-Jul-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Looking forward to it

[26-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
