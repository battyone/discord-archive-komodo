[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Not many people are active anymore

[15-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> @Combat Wombat do u know why the trivia or whatever is gone?

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> not sure

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> forgot we even had a trivia room lol

[15-Oct-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Oh lol i enjoyed that room! Loved the riddles and love giving out eqli

[15-Oct-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> maybe we will get it back

[15-Oct-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> you could do it in rain forest for now

[15-Oct-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and yeah it has been quiet wont stay like this too long

[15-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> all year, crypto discord has slowly gotten quieter, weak hands exiting the crypto markets. Quiet time allows projects to concentrate on work and getting results.

[15-Oct-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> that is true

[15-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Yeah hopefully we get it back @Combat Wombat

[15-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> eventually. at the moment we need to focus on results, not trivia lol

[15-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> project comes first

[15-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hopefully the listing on the new exchange gets some exposure

[15-Oct-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's not loading for me üò±

[15-Oct-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The build certainly will get us extreme exposure

[15-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, some exchanges do list coins without asking, maybe that will happen once that news gets out

[15-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> loaded for me just takes a while sometimes

[15-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> loads for me fine. im only on 15mbps, good ol aussie internet lol

[15-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Maybe you have high latency

[15-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> packet drops

[15-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'll try it again later

[15-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Other sites are loading fine

[15-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm simple minded, if other sites load, and theirs not, it's on their side

[15-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's like the internet company alway's say's that if I have connection issues, it's on my side. But it's their side 99% of üòÇ the times

[15-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> still fine for me

[15-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> fwiw malta is awesome...one of the most amazing islands i ever visited!

[15-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I hope to be closer to the other side of the world eventually, its isolated here in australia and expensive to fly anywhere.

[15-Oct-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Malta sounds nice

[15-Oct-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Depends how long it will be till raisex lists Equaliser on there.

[15-Oct-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm hoping founders are dealing with them to give them any details they need to list Equaliser.

[15-Oct-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hope it will be soon
