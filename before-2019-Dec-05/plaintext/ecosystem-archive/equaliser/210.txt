[dscrdeql] <!üëΩ‚éù‚ï≤‚éù‚ßπ‚éù‚ï≤‚éù‚ßπùîóùî•ùî¨ùîØùî±ùî•‚ß∏‚é†‚ï±‚é†‚ß∏‚é†‚ï±‚é†üëΩ> I think u have a lot of eql  @Cryptoon

[27-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> According to blockfolio üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> it is now worth 3BTC

[27-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I think if I bought 3BTC worth on exrates the sell wall would probably be gone üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah it does look good in block folio

[27-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> one day ü§û

[27-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 3 btc of market buys would put it at like 75 cents lol

[27-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> hell maybe 2 dollars I dont know

[27-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if I had 3 btc though I would have done it 4 days ago haha

[27-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> dont do that now! i need to get my bag first üòÅ

[27-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I dont want to sell my kmd to buy it all üò¶

[27-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> noooo dont do that.

[27-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> So had to do it with dust I had left

[27-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I got all the founders turned on to komodo

[27-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> kmd just too nice

[27-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> tech is insane

[27-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> And very nice to claim your weekly free kmd üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah we just stake our kmd

[27-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[27-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Yeah it's amazing

[27-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I can imagine projects that get funded with kmd

[27-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Just being able to pay for expenses with the rewards

[27-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well it sucked in the beginning and we had to use alot of what we made for administration costs and legal

[27-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and kmd was 3.50 usd then too lol

[27-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> which I think is still ridiculously cheap if you have ever seen me on twitter

[27-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> 0,001 to 0,01 btc per kmd seems fair

[27-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 0.0027 is where I saw it stabilizing once it runs for real, then it could just continue to climb

[27-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hello all

[27-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hi @x2maano

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> üëã

[27-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Hello üëã

[27-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode> i like neo > eth

[27-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> i think komodo and neo are very well matched

[27-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I think so too

[27-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Thanks for all the rain guys, appreciate it

[27-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> np üñê

[27-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> my thoughts are that whoever is dumping will soon run thin, then we can take it back up to where it needs to be.

[27-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think in the next 2 weeks we will see a decent mini alt season

[27-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> sweet

[27-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> EQL already in my wallet

[27-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> your transfer from exrates to your wallet was that fast?

[27-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> nice maybe they are getting better haha

[27-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> yeah

[27-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> took longer to get enough confirmations on my btc transfer

[27-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> but it's in my wallet now

[27-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> nice

[27-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That may be a new record üòÑ Let's hope this update was good. They also announced they're reducing their insane withdraw fees.

[27-Jul-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm'a bout to liquidate my other holdings and get me some BTC. Y'all want the low hanging fruit, you got about two hours üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here

[27-Jul-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> heeeeey

[27-Jul-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> pump it @Biomech-Founder

[27-Jul-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Also quick question on how exchange wallets work

[27-Jul-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> it seems every utxo for an exchange wallet is on a different address

[27-Jul-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> or am I seeing this incorrectly?

[27-Jul-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Probably. It's common practice to generate a new address for each customer and associate it with their account in the database.

[27-Jul-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's also common practice to move it to cold storage until withdraw is called for, so your on exchange balance could easily NOT be at the address you sent it to.

[27-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Hmm because when I withdrew it came from an addess, but did I withdrew from the guy I'm buying from his exchange address?

[27-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> if that would be the case then he deposited about 800k eql

[27-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> at once

[27-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> On exrates? It came from their wallet, and they would have consolidated it for fee reduction and ease of accounting.

[27-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> aha

[27-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The send address is associated with your account, but it's basically a drop box üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> A'ight, I have to go to the store. When I get back, I'm scoopin' as much as I can get, and I won't put it back up cheap. Get it while you can üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[27-Jul-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> heard storms are supposed to be moving in.

[27-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah? Is that thunder I hear?
