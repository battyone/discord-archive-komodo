[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> why, what am I gonna do lol

[23-Jul-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m looking at all options for listings

[23-Jul-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We never know 😄

[23-Jul-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Andy you’re just you bro

[23-Jul-18 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I can do the robot

[23-Jul-18 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Now that would be film worthy 😄

[23-Jul-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m pretty sure I have video ofvandy belly flopping into about 9 inches of water 😂😂

[23-Jul-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> oh yeah, it wasnt a swimming day I dont think

[23-Jul-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> exrates is loading, but friggin slow as hell

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> im still trying to find positive reviews about it

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 😂

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> nvm. . it's cloudshare

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> whatever it's called

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> trying to give myself some hope 😬

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It seems to be down right now. Hopefull that's good.

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> cloudflare

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm getting cloudfare too.

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and apparently if you call their support line it's a fax number

[23-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Goodnight guys

[23-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That tears it. They're government. Only a beauracracy would list their fax number as support.

[23-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Night @🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄

[23-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Biomech-Founder it's the matrix

[23-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Could be. I feel a bit like a coppertop today.

[23-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> NEO is on line 1

[23-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ah well for now ill count what ever i sent there as a loss

[23-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> if it ends up working im happy

[23-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> if not i already dealt with the loss

[23-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[23-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yay

[23-Jul-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm hopeful they'll get it together. They told us that they manually process it, and implied that the team that does so don't work weekends. Not a very satisfactory answer, but we'll find out soon.

[23-Jul-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I was but the more reviews I read the less hopeful I am

[23-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so no more reviews for me

[23-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> have a little faith. youre bumming me out lol 😂

[23-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Also, it's just after 7AM where they're at. I'm hoping the down time means they're on the job, fixing shit.

[23-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> the only thing that gives me hope is that the exchange has been around for 2 years

[23-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[23-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> bass i been scammed on an exchange before

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and i held onto hope for like a week before i accepted it

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What exchange?

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> oh ffs

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I lost enough TEK to be a rich man when Cryptsy vanished.

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it starts with ex

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I feel ya.

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 😂

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> exvo

[23-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it was a new exchange had their own coin and all

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> was looking good.. done some trades everything worked fine

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> then wallets went off line

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and stayed off line

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and the dev disappeared

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> maybe he got hit by a truck or something and he really didn't scam us

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i dunno

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> wow, thats gnarly

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ah well

[23-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 🤞

[23-Jul-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> At least I have 'closure' in that I know for certain Big Vern took the money and ran. And some pleasure in the idea that he got found. Dunno if he did, but the bags ain't moved and nobody's heard from him in years 😛

[23-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> He pissed off some dangerous people.

[23-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> This is why I think we need regulation

[23-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I know you guys disagree

[23-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but without regulation scams will only increase

[23-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't disagree, I disagree on how it should be done. Government regulation is putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.

[23-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yes we need proper regulation.. fair regulation.. good regulation

[23-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> dunno how that would look though

[23-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> anyway im gonna go for a bit

[23-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> been staring at this screen for too long

[23-Jul-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> decentralised regulation somehow would make sense

[23-Jul-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't have time to delve into it right now 😄 I've been studying (and adding to) anarchic economic theory for over 20 years 😄 Catch me when we both have more time.

[23-Jul-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 👋

[23-Jul-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> hopefully i come back to good news haha
