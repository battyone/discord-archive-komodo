[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> I need a lvl 10+ person to test something

[16-Aug-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Good night to you @SwimedDragon

[16-Aug-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> seems like everyone has gone to sleep now

[16-Aug-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> either that or my discord connection is down and I'm just running locally..

[16-Aug-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> talking to myself

[16-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> looks like Exrates doesn't allow you to place orders to 9 decimal digits anymore

[16-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm trying this morning and it doesn't work

[16-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> field goes blank if you put that 9th decimal digit on the end

[16-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> Morning guys

[16-Aug-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> mornite 😃

[16-Aug-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> morning @🚀📈edsky📉🤯

[16-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @Cypher - Founder  have you guys told Exrates to change the 'Rate' field for EQL to BTC to only allow 8 decimal digits?

[16-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it used to allow 9 yesterday and the previous 4 weeks

[16-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm on support with them now and they're a bit clueless

[16-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> @✌Jellysmash✌ i know only 8 digits. of course some sites using more. but i do not understand why

[16-Aug-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> that is like you have  0.1 cent coins - real money

[16-Aug-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's been 9 digits for the last 4 weeks

[16-Aug-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> this morning it's now only 8 digits

[16-Aug-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm trying to determine is it a bug on exrates or did the Equaliser community tell exrates to change it to 8 digits instead of 9

[16-Aug-18 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ✨ ariewayq ✨ ! 4915> ☕ coffe time friends

[16-Aug-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Aug-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> I need to wake up lol

[16-Aug-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> @✌Jellysmash✌ i think btc have also 0.12345678  and not 9

[16-Aug-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <bengyong08> Hello

[16-Aug-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> @boaler that is correct

[16-Aug-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> as far as i know

[16-Aug-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> we have not told them to change it

[16-Aug-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> is it differnet on other coisn too

[16-Aug-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> @NWhiskeyTango thank you for response. and iam a newbie. 😉

[16-Aug-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> iam under 1 year involved in crypto-world

[16-Aug-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> @Tipsy (EQLI) you never sleep? lol

[16-Aug-18 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> nice level up

[16-Aug-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Zzzzzz sleep time haha

[16-Aug-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Lol never sleep

[16-Aug-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <BTC-BTC-BTC> Congrats on the level up. @boaler

[16-Aug-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Exrates allowed 9 digits for last 3 weeks....now it does not.

[16-Aug-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Haven't tried it with other coins

[16-Aug-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> @BTC-BTC-BTC thank you. i was over level 9 lol

[17-Aug-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <BTC-BTC-BTC> wow

[17-Aug-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> @✌Jellysmash✌ - isee also the 9 zeros after digit. strange

[17-Aug-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Seems like no one really cares about that  it's gone from 9 to 8 digits

[17-Aug-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> but it doesnt matter. i do not trade or could buy any coin. iam bankrupt

[17-Aug-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @boaler it was 9 digits least few weeks

[17-Aug-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Eg,  0.0000000094 btc is actually 9.4 satoshis

[17-Aug-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> @✌Jellysmash✌ maybe of the commission? i would ask why they use 9 instead 8

[17-Aug-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It was great to have that on Exrates...now it doesn't allow that

[17-Aug-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Because EQLI price is so low

[17-Aug-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It was down to 1.8 satoshis a few weeks ago

[17-Aug-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <🍀𝕴𝖗𝖎𝖘𝖍𝕲𝖎𝖗𝖑𝕮𝖗𝖞𝖕𝖙𝖔🍀> No time for bounty reading and I get distracted forget prizes anyways.  Its best to DM me to RT if its something important and no bounty fee needed since saves me from reading and checking non rainbot rooms  🤣

[17-Aug-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> @IrishGirlCrypto hahaha you broke a bit

[17-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass would it be worth publishing some sort of results from the active bounty program.....like how many new discord users joined, how many tweets were sent, how much web tragic to Equaliser increased by, how many hits on the white paper, etc..?

[17-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Just to get a better idea of the effectiveness of the campaign

[17-Aug-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Can have a look into it if we have time, bounties will always happen regardless

[17-Aug-18 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Hmm hmm the effectiveness, it's a good idea
