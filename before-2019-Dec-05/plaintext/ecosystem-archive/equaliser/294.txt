[13-Aug-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i see all the founders are idle, but things should pick up again shortly

[13-Aug-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> have you had time to read the whitepaper or get involved in some of the bounties @RyanInSiam ?

[13-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @RyanInSiam, the whitepaper is good, but can be a little long...I summarised it in my medium article which is much shorter

[13-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you have a post to the medium article @✌Jellysmash✌ ?

The Great Equaliser of Cryptocurrencies – Paul Clarke (jellysmas...
Ever felt like the whole cryptocurrency frenzy is just a passing phase devoid of any meaning other than speculative greed? If you’re like…

[13-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yep that's it

[13-Aug-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 👍

[13-Aug-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Only skimmed the site so far, mostly trying to pick up things from people here so far. When I have some more time, will definitely tackle the white paper in full.

[13-Aug-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Thanks, @✌Jellysmash✌, for the medium article. Will be easier to work through first. 😃

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Tl dr : we will begin our building in Puerto Rico with a dual model of operation catering to high end as well as those in need. Homes we build will be bought using Equaliser. 3D printing and domes are our focus starting out. We plan to be globalized in 5 years. Oh and we will have masternodes. There’s the bare bones version of it

[13-Aug-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Definitely check it out and ask questions
