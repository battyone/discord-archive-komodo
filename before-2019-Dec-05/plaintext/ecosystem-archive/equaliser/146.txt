[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> komodo taking for ever so exploring this bdex

[22-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> ya there is nothing

[22-Jul-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> on the dashboard there is balance,price,current. all 0

[22-Jul-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> what pair?

[22-Jul-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hmm. I can't get it to catch anything but BTC and KMD, and only in native mode. Weird.

[22-Jul-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm off to bed shortly, but I'll see if I can figure it out in the morning.

[22-Jul-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Weird

[22-Jul-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I should let it go, but I can't 😄 Appears to be working in Hyperdex. At least loading, just started.

[22-Jul-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> What is price there

[22-Jul-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> ya nothing on barterdex

[22-Jul-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> uhhhh

[22-Jul-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> should be now. Just a couple I put up, kmd and BTC. See if they show up?

[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> exrates ^

[22-Jul-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Exrates has something goofy going on. Either some moron is dumping for way less than anything we sold, or something is screwed up.

[22-Jul-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We're working to resolve it, but I'd wait to hear back from us before trading there. Maybe somebody is that stupid 😄

[22-Jul-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good morning all

[22-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 🍵

[22-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Mornin'

[22-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Or will be in 56 minutes 😛

[22-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hahaaaaaaaa

[22-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Biomech-Founder Do you think people are getting confused by the extra decimal?

[22-Jul-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Possibly, but even with that, the prices they're selling at and the volume don't make sense. Somebody would be taking a a massive haircut.

[22-Jul-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> anything under about 3000 satoshis, at the lowest presale price, would be a loss.

[22-Jul-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Lol

[22-Jul-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm really hoping somebody is that stupid 😄

[22-Jul-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <John Marco> How 5o earn?

[22-Jul-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, I'll report on that in the morning. I am going to bed now. There's a couple order up for y'all to play with on Bdex. We'll rebuild the order books there as well, tomorrow. Hopefully everything works out with Exrates. I do know they currently manually process withdrawals. Which is fifth dan stupid, but allegedly being fixed.

[22-Jul-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> What is fifth Dan stupid

[22-Jul-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Martial arts reference.

[22-Jul-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In systems that use Dans as levels, the fifth dan is a Master.
