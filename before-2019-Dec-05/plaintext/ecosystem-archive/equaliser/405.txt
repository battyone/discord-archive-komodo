[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Does eql havr staking?

[04-Sep-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no, but the founders will have a masternode by the end of the year

[04-Sep-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> theyre working on it currently, along with other things

[04-Sep-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so anyone who buys a masternode - they were talking possibly 100k eqli - would be able to stake

[04-Sep-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i believe thats it. but a founder would know better

[04-Sep-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> unfortunately theyre all yellow. guessing it will be more active in here in a few hours as europe wakes up

[04-Sep-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> only one exchange for eqli currently, but another one coming shortly. it was hinted at today but no details

[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Ok

[04-Sep-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lots of stuff going on with kmd. may take you a week or 2 to get up to speed

[04-Sep-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> same with eqli. they will be building homes soon. as as i said masternodes by eoy

[04-Sep-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> when you type"?level" where does it say you are?

[04-Sep-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Not sure

[04-Sep-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> go to the Tipsy(eqli) in the right sidebar

[04-Sep-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and typ "?level" without quotes

[04-Sep-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> it will tell you level 1 and maybe 68%. which means youre 68% of the way to level2

[04-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you can also do it in #off-topic

[04-Sep-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Looks like im almost lvl2

[04-Sep-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ok good. happens fast the first 2-3 levels

[04-Sep-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> then slows a bunch

[04-Sep-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Sep-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Sep-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm eating almonds

[04-Sep-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Coincidence

[04-Sep-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> "almonds" seems to be a magical word

[04-Sep-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Love smoked and salted almonds

[04-Sep-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeahhhhh

[04-Sep-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Those are ðŸ”¥

[04-Sep-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I eat some nearly every day

[04-Sep-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m about to seriously start getting my weight in check

[04-Sep-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Smoked almonds is the tastiest

[04-Sep-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Slingin all this concrete though I should get swoll quick lol

[04-Sep-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I canâ€™t wait to see if this block holds

[04-Sep-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I went like 50/50 foam to concrete so itâ€™ll be a bit heavy

[04-Sep-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Very interested in block result

[04-Sep-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™ll hit it with water for a week then Iâ€™ll take a bfh to it to see if it holds up

[04-Sep-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I guess blocks need to be small enough that they don't crack weeks later when they cure and dry out

[04-Sep-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m gonna make them huge

[04-Sep-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But Iâ€™ll add fiber and make sure they are approved by an engineer

[04-Sep-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> @CowboyCrypto- Founder what fiver are you using in the concreate ?

[04-Sep-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> Glasfiber?

[04-Sep-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Basalt

[04-Sep-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> Ok ok dont know so mush about that one mor that its a vulcanic rock and very hard rock

[04-Sep-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> What does rhe stone give in concreate?

[04-Sep-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This method uses no aggregate

[04-Sep-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Itâ€™s a blend of fly ash and foam

[04-Sep-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I guess if the blocks aerated and have fiber mesh added to it then they can be large, but still light

[04-Sep-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yes

[04-Sep-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m still working a few things out on this end

[04-Sep-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It kind of comes down to how this first block turns out

[04-Sep-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ok itâ€™s 130 am lol
