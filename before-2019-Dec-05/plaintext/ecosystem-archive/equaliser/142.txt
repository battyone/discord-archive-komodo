[21-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Making housing affordable might be something he is interested in

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> This conversation is progressing quite fast haha

[21-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> its a pleasure to have a backlit keyboard so looking up at the screen has reduced.

[21-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Yeah sorry my thoughts are always all over the place

[21-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nothing wrong with that.

[21-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Thought of livecoin where DIG trades which is one of Ronnie Moas' picks

[21-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> And thought of you guys and that he might be interested in EQL

[21-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont follow crypto news or how certain coins prices are doing what among other useless concerns people have in developed countries. I am going to build homes and that's all there is to it. You can check my linked in and learn who I am, I am Andrew Burns form Adelaide Australia. I am a Gen Y that is sick of politicians having a conflict of interest in keeping property prices so high.

[21-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I wouldn't call 'em useless concerns üòÑ

[21-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> oh the humanity

[21-Jul-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its just indicative of poor governance. humans dont need governance, humans need to learn about selflessness. one good deed a day for the rest of life should help somewhat.

[dscrdeql] <x2maano> whats going on here???

[21-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We are trying to keep up with community requests, particularly with accumulating equaliser. Of course there is a learning curve with barterdex however, we decided that listing on a centralised exchange would be easier to get into equaliser. We pay attention to what is suggested we do. Forgive us if things dont meet requirements, we are working quite a lot for our mission y'all are with us on.

[21-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> hey x2 just bought my first bag of equaliser üòÑ
