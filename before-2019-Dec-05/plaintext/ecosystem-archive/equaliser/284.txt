[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Pretty cool concept.

[10-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Ah, nice.

[10-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Are those hard to set up?

[10-Aug-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Cypher set them up, I think. I work with trading bots, but other bots, not so much 😄

[10-Aug-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Understood.

[10-Aug-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Anyway, folks, it's been awesome, but I'm dreadfully behind at work here at the office. Will try to check in later. 😉

[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> i think if you rain 100 10 times, they will come!!! lol

[10-Aug-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thats a good idea, split the 1000 rain over a small window

[10-Aug-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Wait that's not true I tweeted something for a giveaway once or twice

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> the way its going, seems to be every hour thus 100 may be reached in 3ish days

[10-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> This is the only project I hold other than eca (even though it's not much) 👍

[10-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Things in crypto land seem to be the calm before the storm of the raging bulls haha

[10-Aug-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @AndronicusBass i posted it up in the eca off topic channel, hopefully you get a few more tweets

[10-Aug-18 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Much appreciated however, careful not to get yourself penalised, some communities dont like other projects advertised. We are pretty laid back here if its projects that have real world goals of helping the less fortunate and the average jill and joe 👌 💕

[10-Aug-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Nah it's fine, the off topic channel is cool with stuff like that

[10-Aug-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> I think lol, I'm not worried 😂

[10-Aug-18 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> ah, electracoin, thats what it means in your name

[dscrdeql] <slipersty> i did donate a few coins too the greek found for the fire

[10-Aug-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nice, greece has had a bad few years, environmentally and economically. I believe that people even dont want to inherit property because of high taxes. That was afew years ago, not sure if its changed since.

[10-Aug-18 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> yhe thay have had it rough :/

[10-Aug-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> When cypress had the bank shutdowns and people were unable to access their own money or were limited to how much, I started researching and came to the conclusion, crypto is the future after the masses get past all the fud by the mainstream media

[10-Aug-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> yes

[10-Aug-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In fact, in 2014, november to be precise, there was a debate in U.K parliament on money creation and society. It was mentioned that people are calling for complete denationalisation of currency and cryptocurrency is shown that it is possible

The Money myth exploded - The financial enigma resolved
The Money Myth Exploded” was one of the first articles of Louis Even, and remains one of the most popular to explain how money is created as a debt by private banks.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> "How can we bring back to you $1080 when there is only $1000 on the entire island?”

“That's because of the interest, my friends. Did your production not increase?"

“Yes, but the money hasn't. And it is money you're asking for, not our products. You are the only one who can make money. But you made only $1000, and yet you ask $1080. This is not possible!”

[10-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Exactly. I remember reading this at one stage a few years ago. Much more research I have done over the years came to the same conclusion

[10-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> mike maloneys 'hidden secrets of money' is a great series free on youtube, collectively about 6-8 hours worth. Also I love ray dalio's 'how the economic machine works' is 30 mins and one of my favourite videos

[10-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> intresting will need too watch that

[10-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nice, birthday parties rock. Once everything is organised and full swing, hopefully you can enjoy without having to moderate too much but then again, kids parties can be unpredictable :)

[10-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, I have autism, so that makes birthday parties harder, but it's all for my son 😃

[10-Aug-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You get that social anxiety?

[10-Aug-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not that really, but I'm getting a lot of stress when there's stuff happening that usually doesn't happen

[10-Aug-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Last time I had a lot family on the floor, I started to get insta headaches, and when they all left it was gone within a few minutes

[10-Aug-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> All the best, I'm praying it goes smoothly for you

[10-Aug-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I really don't know why it happens, it just does. But I think it will be fine today 😃 I am prepared this year haha
