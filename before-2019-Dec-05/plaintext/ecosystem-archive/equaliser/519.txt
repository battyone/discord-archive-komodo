[24-Nov-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Our first form

[24-Nov-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just looking at the volume on stex and it looks like a lot of small lots. could be people who are cashing out on their EQLI rains

[24-Nov-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just a guess

[24-Nov-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Could be

[24-Nov-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Is that a metal frame?  looks like you've welded it together...nice

[24-Nov-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> nice and reuseable

[24-Nov-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hired a welder

[24-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 16ga steel

[24-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Thing weighs like 300lbs

[24-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @c2k  yes, they're cashing out their rains....and then cry they don't get enough more rains...lol

[24-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> That's pretty heavy.

[24-Nov-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m actually going to do away with rains for a while

[24-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's 136kg ...that's heavy

[24-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it is

[24-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'd deadlift it but not try to lift it around any other way

[24-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It separates

[24-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[24-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pin latch drops the side

[24-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> ahhhh..ok...so it comes apart for easy moving and getting the blocks out after they've dried

[24-Nov-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[24-Nov-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> good design

[24-Nov-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And it has slats to put seperating sheets between

[24-Nov-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> hey everyone!

[24-Nov-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Will make 8 blocks at a time

[24-Nov-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> hi @MassimoStyle

[24-Nov-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> take a while to mix up enough aircrete for 8 of those large blocks

[24-Nov-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hour

[24-Nov-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 20 min if I had help

[24-Nov-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That sucks get to feeling better

[24-Nov-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Best idea ever by the way. Giving coins away is never a good idea unless you get something in return. Make people post on twitter , bitcoin Ann or some kind of advertising for the community. Just my opinion. But good move

[24-Nov-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It had to be done

[24-Nov-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[24-Nov-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> That's called a bounty

[24-Nov-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> We did have one of those

[24-Nov-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Was good and got a lot of people involved

[24-Nov-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Lots of tweets

[24-Nov-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Raining small amounts is ok to get ppl in the door though. Just enough so they think they're getting enough, but not enough so they can cash out and bring the order book down

[24-Nov-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™ve given a lot of coins away lol

[24-Nov-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Will take care of itself in time, once the dumpers  finish dumping their small amounts

[24-Nov-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Woops, I can't see the rain room

[24-Nov-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Well I will still come and see you every day for coffee Jellysmash

[24-Nov-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Haha...thanks man

[24-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> â˜•

[24-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Some cool stuff going on here

[24-Nov-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> When bull market starts again it's going to be crazy

[24-Nov-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Might have a house ready to sell by then as well....Will make headlines

[24-Nov-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We shall see

[24-Nov-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Ok, just saw the announcement

[24-Nov-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m doin what I can

[24-Nov-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Wow, checked toprain....you've given away 36k EQLI

[24-Nov-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I donâ€™t know how fast I can build solo, but itâ€™ll help prove my point

[24-Nov-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This building system can be done with minimal skilled labor and funds.

[24-Nov-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Fitout takes a while as well

[24-Nov-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Bathrooms and kitchens

[24-Nov-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I installed a flatpack DIY kitchen at our house, works ok.

[24-Nov-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Screws it all together and installed on walls over a weekend

[24-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The plan is to create a simple design where it is plumbed in one wall

[24-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Nice

[24-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Bathroom below and above another bath with kitchen on the other side of the wall

[24-Nov-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> That'll make plumbing simpler

[24-Nov-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yup

[24-Nov-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Exposed conduit for wiring will give it a modern look as well

[24-Nov-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> So no need for gyprock lined internal walls

[24-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nope

[24-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But itâ€™ll have gypsum board anyway

[24-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Hey guys! Just stopped by to catch up.  @CowboyCrypto construction designs sound good. Looking forward to seeing the first home. Saw the announcement, can we still withdraw our balance? Bot doesn't seem to work for withdraw.

[24-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it should work

[24-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I'll try again tomorrow. Tried twice with no luck.

[24-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Whatâ€™s your balance?

[24-Nov-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <javadth> what happened to rain channel ?

[24-Nov-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> again changes?

[24-Nov-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Details in the latest #announcementsðŸ“¢

[24-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is it meant to be that the rain channel stops or all the rains? Because it is still working in other rooms

[24-Nov-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @CowboyCrypto 24 and change. Last night I tried to withdraw all minus 1 to my agama wallet but it just gave me â›” as a response

[24-Nov-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <plazma> I also rarely get rain tips....

[24-Nov-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> @âœŒJellysmashâœŒ hai dude, have nice sunday

[24-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the rains are done for now. GOOD

[24-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hopefully anyone who wants to participate in the next phase of this project, the GROWTH phase, will start buying on STEX or ask cowboy to sell them some EQLI otc

[24-Nov-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> too many people are accumulating EQLI via rains and then just selling them for very little

[24-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> start buying them and support the project!
because in a few months when EQL I is trading at 500sats instead of 50sats you will be very happy

[24-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> :EQLI1:

[24-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <chefchaoen> do not sell your EQLI with low price :EQLI1: : ðŸš€

[24-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there any way to see how much EQLI the whale(s) have left? Or make a guess of it
