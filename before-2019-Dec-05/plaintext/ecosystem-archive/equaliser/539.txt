[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've just been trying to find a specific yt video of a martin north and john adams discussion on bail in's. I will find it eventually and share it, If I forget, remind me. I have an early meeting in the morning so must get some rest and can take me a bit to wind down.

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> This chat has been very inactive lately crypto sentiment keeps slowing down ;s I guess that will change soon hopefully üòâ

[19-Jan-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> Apparently there has been an exodus of crypto advocates, not sure who but its what I heard. Weak hands leaving crypto, when the markets are better you watch all crypto discords become heavily active again

[19-Jan-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm not sure honestly. We are focusing on our product currently.

[19-Jan-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once our building system is automated, the markets will be very much so alive

[19-Jan-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, it's the same in all discords...very quiet lately.

[19-Jan-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> seem to get quieter and quieter,,,especially over xmas period

[19-Jan-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
