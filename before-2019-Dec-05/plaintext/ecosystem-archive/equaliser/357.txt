[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> see you later

[21-Aug-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's been another freezing wind today in Sydney

[21-Aug-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> what was Melbourne like?

[21-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> looks like someone has put a sell order in for 1 million EQLI at 0.00000007 , ie 7 sats

[21-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's created a bit of a wall

[21-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> be hard to get through that for the price to go up any further

[21-Aug-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> what's wrong with people.. that's a lot to sell

[21-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe someone would like to buy a large portion and could buy up 1 million at a cheap price

[21-Aug-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Aug-18 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> scalping a few sats at a time

[21-Aug-18 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah probably there hasn't been a dump like in the beginning

[21-Aug-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think its going to take a few months to get some positive price movement

[21-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> depends.. it could happen in one day if there was a volume increase

[21-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> project needs something tangible

[21-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> just dont think we will get it on exrates

[21-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Morning folks

[21-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wow, who bought that million EQLI? üòÆ

[21-Aug-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Someone must have bought it, nobody from in here?

[21-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wish I was it haha

[21-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> It might me

[21-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> It wasn‚Äôt me for sure

[21-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But damn, I thought that whale was done dumping, but looks like he's still around

[21-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Oh it happened again

[21-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Wow üòÆ

[21-Aug-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, for people that still join in it's a good chance to get it cheap

[21-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> üëç

[21-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i dont thnk its the whale anymore

[21-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just my opinion

[21-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i thnk someone has stepped in and started trading this...trying to scalp for a few sats at a time

[21-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if not a person, then an algo

[21-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm holding what I have for now üòÉ

[21-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> most inhere are

[21-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> waste of time to try to scalp for 5ish sats at a time

[21-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, if it's with a million a time it will sure add up I guess

[21-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If it wasn't profitable he/it would have stopped

[21-Aug-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> right. each 1mm with 5sats profit is approx $300

[21-Aug-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats why i thkn its an algo. ...unfortunately

[21-Aug-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lack of volume makes it easier for them

[21-Aug-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> that will change

[21-Aug-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I just need to try and forget about discord for a few weeks and look back then. It's just hard to do and stay away from crypto related things üò¶

[21-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once this project gets going we will look back at current prices as a gift

[21-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and the flipper will look back and wish he held

[21-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> imo

[21-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, he will regret it üòÉ And we can all laugh back at him if he missed out

[21-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> :WhaleCum:

[21-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It would especially be fun if he sets a buy in lower and then the team announces the first build. He will miss that rocket

[21-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> :vote_up:

[21-Aug-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Aug-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So falling asleep isn't a problem when you get home?

[21-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> not when i work for 12 hours. just a problem when i am driving home.... trying not to fall asleep behind the wheel. sucks

[21-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I guess it isn't busy on the road at around 5 am right?

[21-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't have a driving license so I don't know how it must be to drive when tired

[21-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> @Linkara6669-Mod be careful man

[21-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i try my hardest. just sucks. sometimes i have to pull over and take a 10 minute nap just to make it home for a 15 minute drive when i am that tired. one time i ended up taking an hour long nap and didnt realizeit til i got home lol

[21-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> my friend was freaking out thinking maybe i didnt make it home

[21-Aug-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Alway's good to take a nap if you need it, even if it's short one

[21-Aug-18 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> well its good that you pull over when needed
