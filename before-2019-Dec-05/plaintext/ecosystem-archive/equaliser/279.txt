[dscrdeql] <c2k> had someone remote into my pc...that didnt help either

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> well @c2k   that's good 😃  isn't a problem from me 😃  app have problem 😃

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> theyre trying to recreate on their side

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> nice @Biomech-Founder  😃

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> is black ?

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nope.

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I like my coffee thick 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> sugar ?

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> milk ?

[09-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> milk and splenda.

[09-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> usually a bit of vanilla, but I ran out 😛

[09-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the dumper worked like a kind of 'airdrop'

[09-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> a community service...lol

[09-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Dunno what up with HDEX, haven't tried it in a while. It doesn't keep orders till cancelled. My next excursion into barterdex, I'm using the CLI for marketmaker 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ?tip @✌Jellysmash✌ 10

[09-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That's for a positive attitude 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> wow....thanks

[09-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Which I don't have this time of day or when thinking about the dumper 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> very appreciated

[09-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> so i haven't a positive attitude ? 😢

[09-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> fwiw i think dumper is gone and its more like some ppl who bot in the single sats just lightening up a bit

[09-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> stupid imo but is what it  is

[09-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gives all us the opp to pick up more MN bags

[09-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> He ain't gone.

[09-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That leading order was culled from the nearly 1 million at 35 sats.

[09-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, I'm grateful for some mn bags

[09-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But he's running out of steam. I think we're seeing the exit strategy now 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, ...i actually bought some of that

[09-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> now I'm down a bit

[09-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I bought a fair amount 😄 Sooner he's run dry, the better.

[09-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think long term we'll look back and wonder why we didnt buy more

[09-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But what really needs to happen is some real volume. Hopefully the bounty program will kick up some traffic. Just south of 2 BTC puts it in 3 digit territory.

[09-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I won't. I didn't buy more cuz I ain't got enough BTC 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If that changes, homey be gone, I be rich 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> lmao

[09-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Trust me, if I had the BTC, I'd buy it up to 1 K and defend that like an angry wolverine 😄

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here now is the time to support Equaliser. We have only 39 retweets at the moment. That means 61 more to 1000 rain.

[09-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'll even up the ante. I'll rain another 1000 if it hits 150 retweets today.

[09-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And don't forget, there's a new bounty program coming out!

[09-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hmm, my wild ass guess was wrong 😛

[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> ~serverinfo

[09-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so theoretically we can get to 100

[09-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but i wonder how many of those members are active or online every day

[09-Aug-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> can the team try to promote in the KMD #general discord to get more people interested?
