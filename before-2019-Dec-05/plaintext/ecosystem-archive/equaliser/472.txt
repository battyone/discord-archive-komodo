The Equaliser Difference (EQLI): Big Things On The Horizon
Sometimes the hype throughout the crypto-verse just drives me crazy. Everyone asking “When moon?” or “When Lambo?” was fun at first, but…

[10-Oct-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Haha...like the lines from your article: "Everyone asking “When moon?” or “When Lambo?” was fun at first, but now I look at it as a juvenile and inexperienced tag line from people who I want to dissociate myself with when talking crypto at a party or dinner."
