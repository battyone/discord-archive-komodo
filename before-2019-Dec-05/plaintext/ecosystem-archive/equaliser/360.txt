[22-Aug-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yup we need strong buy walls for this to change

[22-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> finished work now?

[22-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yup

[22-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> there looks like a strong buy wall at 45

[22-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> 4.5

[22-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, that's right

[22-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> all these people selling cheap will look back and think what the hell did i do? lol

[22-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, maybe

[22-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> no maybes about it

[22-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> listen to wombat!

[22-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> üòÑ

[22-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think once there's a house or two built, like a demo house and people can see what they're gonna be buying then that type of thing will make a difference

[22-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> There'll be proof in the puding

[22-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> when people can see what awesome houses can be built and the price of them then they'll understand

[22-Aug-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and queue up to get one of them

[22-Aug-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I know they're working on it, just a matter of time

[22-Aug-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> not sure how long it takes to make one of them

[22-Aug-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I watched the video and it looks fairly straight forward

[22-Aug-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe in a few weeks

[22-Aug-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm really looking forward to seeing this progress

[22-Aug-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's going to be fantastic

[22-Aug-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It'd be like a demo house like they have in Australia where you go to one of those housing demonstration villages

[22-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> each building company has a few houses so you can see the design and what they're like

[22-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> a lot of people find it hard to visualise that sort of stuff

[22-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but when they see it in reality, they'll love it

[22-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah i agree.. i don't think they are waiting on building but getting the right permissions to build

[22-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's why those demo homes are so important to the bvjuilding industry

[22-Aug-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I guess they have to buy a block of land first and then get the building permissions and the build according to the council regulations and building codes and compliance.

[22-Aug-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's stuff can take time

[22-Aug-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> especially in australia

[22-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just getting a council approval in sydney takes months

[22-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> to do even the most simplest modification

[22-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm sure other countries aren't so long

[22-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but where ever there's regulations you can guarantee it takes time

[22-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah i think thats why beginning in PR is a better idea

[22-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We will build a few types, I plan to build one of my own here in AUS, I used to like the idea of shipping containers but they get crazy hot especially in SA. Energy efficient is a key property of the homes.

[22-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I saw the video and it was amazing...looked so easy

[22-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and cheap..

[22-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they said about $2000

[22-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but that'd be USD so about $2700 aussie

[22-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but for a house, that's incredible

[22-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I guess fitting it out with taps, toilets, etc may cost another $5k as that can be one of th emost costly bits and pieces

[22-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> that would be nice... costs you more to do some landscaping here lol

[22-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hahaha...yes

[22-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What is $2000?

[22-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I got a back deck built at my last house...cost $10k

[22-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I saw in the youtube video by that building company..in was in a link on the Equaliser official twitter site.

[22-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> can't remember their name

[22-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but the video showed the technology behind how they build the houses and how light the aircrete is and how strong also

[22-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and super easy to pour into a frame and mix up

[22-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that video was an eye opener

[22-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üå∑micaine10üå∑> Hello

[22-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah the aircrete homes
