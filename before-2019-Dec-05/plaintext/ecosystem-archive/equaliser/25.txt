[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You can run a full node with mining enabled for the transaction fee.

[06-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> 🛑 YOU NEED TO BE A HIGHER LEVEL...
🍜🙂☝ Hi @Cryptoon! It looks like you are trying to access a level-restricted command. You are currently at <level 1> but to use the ?rain command you must be at least <level 2>. Just keep chatting and being active in the community and you will surely get there before you know it!
