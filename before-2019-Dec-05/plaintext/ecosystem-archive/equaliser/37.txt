[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> It's coming nighttime here

[07-Jul-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Wish I could get my day back again

[07-Jul-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I can hear the port adelaide game on at adelaide oval.

[07-Jul-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Ha..good hearing

[07-Jul-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Port Adelaide are playing st Kilda.

[07-Jul-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Port should easily win

[07-Jul-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> St Kilda around bottom of ladder

[07-Jul-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> @AndronicusBass are you watching it on tv?

[07-Jul-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nah, i live near adelaide oval

[07-Jul-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @jellysmash whale whale am awake looking at stuff

[07-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> whale

[07-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> wish i was a crypto whale

[07-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I wallow and swim in my crypto

[07-Jul-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> if i was a whale I'd take a big breath and blow crypto out my blow hole

[07-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I think the trick would be to choose the right crypto with the right viscosity

[07-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> if it was too thick like btc it'd be hard to blow as much out

[07-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Verge...too thin

[07-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> maybe an eos might be the trick

[07-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> that cold breeze has come back again

[07-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> it felt like summer for 2 days

[07-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> i like summer

[07-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> no one like winter

[07-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Aspire219> winter is coming

[07-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Aspire219> haha

[07-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont know whay but I have a gut feeling that EOS is going to be like a ripple. for the powers that be. centralising different projects i think

[07-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> yea, maybe. as long as the banks don't end up owning it like ripple then that might be ok

[07-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Halting funds and authorising reversal is not good

[07-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> but not a true community coin though

[07-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> was that trouble with EOS mainnet weeks ago

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> not sure.....

[07-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> i'm not sure whjat that means?

[07-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> does it mean no privacy if you use eos?

[07-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hard fork could be possible, might rhyme with the ethereum forking with etc

[07-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
