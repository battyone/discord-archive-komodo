[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Hello

[13-Aug-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hello üòÉ

[13-Aug-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> morning

[13-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Can i ask a sincere question?

[13-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> yes

[13-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Would a pool for mining EQLI be a positive thing for the project?

[13-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I don't know how that would affect it. The mining reward is super small, and we are implementing masternodes soon.

[13-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> True. I mean a pool won't take over the network with dPOW. I am just trying to figure what the positives would be and I find none

[13-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Things i see...

[13-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> -pool would have a "fee"

[13-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> -pool would earn most of the block rewards

[13-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> - people would spend more on electricity trying to fight for the highest share % on pool

[13-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> -other "solo" miners would be EVEN less "profitable"

[13-Aug-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> the block reward, currently, is .0001 EQL per block. This is going to go away. It was an error in the code. We MIGHT keep it, but probably not. By running a full node with gen=true in your EQL.conf, you ARE mining and you will get the transaction fees.

[13-Aug-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In our design, we deliberately wanted to avoid the problems associated with pools.

[13-Aug-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> You can set one up, easily, but it's not going to be profitable, unless you and your friends wanted to form a private one to pool cheap hardware. Even then, I don't see it being worthwhile.

[13-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I could be wrong, as things progress, but I'm thinking smart contracts will be where the profit lies üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> With all these facts i just see it hurting to have a pool more then helping. Do you all agree?

[13-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah. I see exactly one exception, and it's only personal use.

[13-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If you got a bunch of computers or old equipment that can mine, making your own pool might help your chances of processing transactions.

[13-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But outside of that, I really don't see a use case. Especially for a public pool.

[13-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I've run several pools. Hell, I'm running one now üòÑ But I don't see the point for this one.

[13-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> hey everyone

[13-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hi @Catalyst

[13-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I kinda miss the dumper now I'd like to buy more cheap EQLI

[13-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha...that's some cool jelly

[13-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yeah, got a few more people interested üòÑ Good support starting to build. Dumper is still there, he's just contained üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Next major goal, 100 satoshis.

[13-Aug-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> He must be doing smaller dumps

[13-Aug-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yup.

[13-Aug-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> He tried earlier today, and got shot down. Got bought out every time he lowballed, and it went back up higher, and with higher buy support. and this time, I didn't do it üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haven't noticed him the last day or so....looks like no one wants to sell under 10sats since Saturday

[13-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> üòá

[13-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Wouldn't be any buy support there or anything...

[13-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Biomech I was wondering if you were buying up all those low sell orders about a week ago...

[13-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It pushed the price up a lot

[13-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not all of 'em. Didn't have the money.

[13-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But some of 'em.

[13-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I been fightin' this son of a bitch hard.

[13-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if he does have more, wondering if he knows we are all waiting for below 10sats to buy 7figs therefore hes tryig to be higher

[13-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can't take him out all at once, but I can do the death of a thousand cuts.

[13-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I thought it was going to keep going up and bought at 46 sats...urrgh

[13-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> probably üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @c2k Haha...that's me...waiting below 10 sats...just on case

[13-Aug-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive been there too

[13-Aug-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> he must sense some big size waiting

[13-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I got peeps helping. I wouldn't try for below 10 sats too hard at this point.

[13-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Never hurts to have a low ball order in though. Just in case...

[13-Aug-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes that's what it's looking like

[13-Aug-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im not really trying. bag already big. but if he gets stupid im willing to clean him out

[13-Aug-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> üëç

[13-Aug-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Same...my bag is big-ish....but I don't want to miss out on a good opportunity

[13-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure

[13-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I just want to get it back to the low end of the dICO price. If you guys make a killing on the way, all the better üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nothing like a bonus to keep people interested.

[13-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> absolutely. that would be nice. also would be nice to buy a dome home with some of my bag

[13-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> nice plot in PR

[13-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no federal taxes

[13-Aug-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you know...good stuff

[13-Aug-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[13-Aug-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> If i get a dome I'm renting it out until i need a house

[13-Aug-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> if possible lol

[13-Aug-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If we're half as successful as we're aiming for, and  caught the low end of the dumps... you might be sitting on a resort üòõ

[13-Aug-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> better get back to PR

[13-Aug-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ha, sounds like a nice plan. ive been to some half deserted islands in the bahamas that would be a nice place to lay down a resort

[13-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> what are your thoughts on PR @Llama-Admin ?

[13-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'd like to build on an uninhabited island in the future. Planned community, fully self sustaining üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But that's down the road a ways.

[13-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> we should get some houses down

[13-Aug-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, we got to get one or two up, approved, and where everyone can see and touch them. From there, there's no stopping us üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If Barterdex and the market had cooperated, we'd already be there. But, ambitious projects always get derailed. The only think we didn't seriously expect was homey the dumper. And he's an irritant. We're just delayed a bit. This shit is going down.

[13-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hope for the best and plan for the worst üòÑ We fell somewhere in the middle.

[13-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> One serious investor, and Homey is done. Probably pretty wealthy out of it, damn it, but done.

[13-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I basically see the scenarios playing out like this:

[13-Aug-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> One, prices stay low for a while. We build small, get interest up, it takes a while, but we get it rolling.

[13-Aug-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> two, he gets stuffed, gives up, or gets eaten by a whale. Time is shortened.

[13-Aug-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Three, (and this is in the works) we get listed on a couple more exchanges. Homey can't crash most of 'em to the insane lows because unlike exrates, most exchanges have limits on the lower size of orders. He has to play in his sandbox, and become irrelevant. Everybody else profits, we go to PR in style üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> You'll note failure is not one of my options.

[13-Aug-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and 4, jl777 steps in, throws down 2 btc to take out any dumb sellers, and gets EQL to where it should be. stick a fork in the whale dumper because hes done.

[13-Aug-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Would be nice. Don't care if it's him or somebody(ies) else.

[13-Aug-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Which reminds me, I need to see if they got komodo ocean up to the current standard yet üòÑ Also, the issues with the electrum servers have been solved. I'd like to claim full credit for that....

[13-Aug-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But since I'm not a liar, it was Siu at chainmakers.

[13-Aug-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[13-Aug-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And I was the cause of the error, dammit.

[13-Aug-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Missed a configuration setting on the update, and screwed up one of them real bad.

[13-Aug-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Luckily, Chainmakers are badasses, and they got it sorted quick. Any of you guys considering a crypto project, go there üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We got massive value out of what we paid. They're seriously good people to work with for development.

[13-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> pardon the few missing channels real quick

[13-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> I have to do some strange things for a moment to refit the new structure

[13-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Figures. Windows takes a dump and the channel I'm in disppears üòõ

[13-Aug-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> is there anything special we need to do to 'register' for the bounty program?

[13-Aug-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> or just do what the bounty says to do and post evidence of it in discrd bounty channel?

[13-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Ok I was gone for the past few days and looks like I missed a lot. The new program getting overhauled sounds good.

[13-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Need to step up my game to try to hit level 5 again quicker!
