[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Markets are driven by emotion. If you can keep your head, you'll keep your fortune and grow it.

[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hello all

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> tea time

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> üçµ

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> lo ok what is tether then?

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Tether is a a stablecoin backed by nonsense.

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> @Biomech-Founder exactly

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Probably fractional reserve üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> and why do almost all exchnages use it...   its  Liberty reserve 2.0

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> wake up

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> tether is debatable people have different views on it

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But we can't prove it.

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and both make decent arguments

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't trust bitfinex, never have.

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but the problem is.. each person who makes their argument things the other guys are idiots

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> its run by the same guy who ran liberty reserve.

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But so far, Tether has been a good trading anchor. I wouldn't hold it long term.

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> u guys know that?

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> people who think tether is a scam call the others idiots and people who don't think its a scam call the others idiots

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i don't think for a second btc will go to 0

[25-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, I did. Partially. It's also part of Bitfinex.

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it could happen but I don't think it will

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I never call anyone idiot..

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Anything is possible though right?

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I think Tether is not a scam, but I do think they're doing fractional reserve. And I find it absolutely hilarious that central banks are calling them on it üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not saying you magic

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> just speaking in general here

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I call lots of people idiots üòÑ Sometimes to their face.

[25-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But only if I can prove it.

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I seen what you done there

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> how do you know you aren't the idiot and they are just so intelligent that you can't comprehend what they say?

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> However, in the Tether issue, I can't say either side is wrong, so I'm just watching.

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üò¨

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I just want people to be safe.. not to lose money and now is perfect time to make some and wait and see

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Oh, I've called the man in the mirror an idiot on multiple occasions.

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And vice versa.

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> btc is not healthy right now

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Biomech-Founder lol

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> looks it

[25-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> but is not

[25-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, but it's improving.

[25-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> on the back of wash trade with tether yes

[25-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> looks decent to me im gonna hold what i got its not much but still gonna hold it

[25-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm not of the opinion that BTC is the final be all end all of crypto. It started the train and it's staying around for a good long time.

[25-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> without T   BTC would already be back under 4k

[25-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thanks for your concern though magic üëç

[25-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> if i see it dip below previous lows thats when ill get worried

[25-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Thanks for the rain

[25-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't hold long term, I trade the dips. Well, I hold the gains üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> when the red train come

[25-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> allways keep in mind magic byt3 said so üòÉ

[25-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah and the countless other people

[25-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Red train been running all year

[25-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I actually think privacy based coins will eventually eclipse BTC, because even the Hoi Polloi are starting to realize that our alleged leaders are far too interested in what we do/don't do with our money.

[25-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> I ment rain

[25-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i was told to sell at 6k and at 7k

[25-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so ill just keep holding till i see something i don't like

[25-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Let's also not forget the long running history of fiat.

[25-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> yes @Biomech-Founder  you are correct btc is not the end game or coin it will have it's day

[25-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!üëΩ‚éù‚ï≤‚éù‚ßπ‚éù‚ï≤‚éù‚ßπùîóùî•ùî¨ùîØùî±ùî•‚ß∏‚é†‚ï±‚é†‚ß∏‚é†‚ï±‚é†üëΩ> well is 16:06  at me let's calculate üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In the long run, to misquote Keynes, all fiat has died.

[25-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!üëΩ‚éù‚ï≤‚éù‚ßπ‚éù‚ï≤‚éù‚ßπùîóùî•ùî¨ùîØùî±ùî•‚ß∏‚é†‚ï±‚é†‚ß∏‚é†‚ï±‚é†üëΩ> time for withdraw üòÉ

[25-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> It‚Äôs all speculation at this stage

[25-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That part's not. The only speculation about ANY fiat money is WHEN it's going to die, not if.

[25-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Who really know what will happen

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> fiat is no good

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not me thats for sure

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Fiat used to be backed by gold

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> until i can pay my bills and buy everything i need with something other then fiat i love fiat

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> fiat is evil

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The us dollar was inflated by 86 percent THAT WE KNOW of in 2008-9. How many times can that be sustained.

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Fiat was not and never will be backed by gold.

[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> all we need is sharp pin

[25-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> pop

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Certain coins that became fiat were previously backed by gold.

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> You can pay your bills

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> remember you bought the computer/phone or what ever device you are on right now with this evil fiat

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> if nobody says anything and keeps quiet

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> they can keep inflating all they want

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> because the sheep stay in line

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Actually, I bought both with BTC üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
