[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @Cryptoon  good afternoon  üòÉ

[30-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here Some of us are still having issues regarding the fork that occured at block 61648. If you are not currently in sync with the block explorer, do not make ANY transactions, as they will end up being reversed. The main chain has resolved the fork, but there is some work to be done to get your wallet properly in sync, and any transactions on the fork will be lost. (not the coins, the transactions). As soon as we are certain of the fix, I will post it up here and in announcements. We have been working hard on this in the background, and consulting with the Komodo team as well.  If you are up to date with the explorers, all is well. If not, hang loose, help is on the way.

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Biomech-Founder I withdrew from exrates to my wallet before this happened.. it originally showed up in my wallet and now is missing. Is that due to the same problem?

[30-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> native or lite mode?

[30-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> if lite it can be that SPV isnt in sync yet

[30-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> good morning

[30-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lite mode but it originally showed up in my wallet confirmed and all now its gone just wondering if thats the same problem

[30-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ganjie> good evening

[30-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I had coins showing then not show then showing again..real weird stuff

[30-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Yeah can be due to a resync of the spv servers

[30-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> (I think)

[30-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep lets just wait for them to fix it don't send or deposit coins until then

[30-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ArthurSk12> Wazzzzzzupp fellas!

[dscrdeql] <c2k> little blustery in here today

[30-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode> morning

[30-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @CombatWombat I am up to my eyeballs right now but it would be helpful to know what block approximately the transactions were missing. SPV should be working fine right now. However the block that the fork was at is 61428. Clients on the wrong chain tend to stop at about 6162 1

[30-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I have to get my kids up and squared away right now. After that I'm all over this.

[30-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> what do you mean by fork?

[30-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> crap. . eql got forked?

[30-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> üôÇ

[30-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and I don't know how to check what block I am at on lite mode

[30-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> go do what you gotta do we will talk later Biomech take care of the kids first üëå

[30-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> A secondary chain was created. There were a couple of critical updates to the Komodo wallets. I missed one. I am not certain this is what caused it. But two of our servers where on the fork. That has been resolved. Now we just need to get all the wallet Square.

[30-Jul-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> is the issue syncing in Agama affecting SPV and Native?

[30-Jul-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> as in agama i cant get SPV working - Connection error!
Trying to switch to another server...

[30-Jul-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> fwiw, i restarted agama bc my spv server wasnt updating

[30-Jul-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once restarted it changed to the other server and my balance updated

[30-Jul-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i believe the server that updated my bal was  159.65.91.235. while the 167.99.204.42  server was stuck

[30-Jul-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> that was my experience anyway

[30-Jul-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> how do you check what block you are on

[30-Jul-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> '

[30-Jul-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> getblockinfo?

[30-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Not really sure, dont use native

[30-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Pocketmom go(Graphic Designer)> Hi

[30-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> BRB, will answer everything then. SPV SHOULD be fine, but I'll double check shortly. It was working when I went to bed. I need about a half hour üòÑ

[30-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> For me it‚Äôs the same issue

[30-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Howdy all

[30-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> maybe this is one reason the whale continues to sit at ridiculously low prices on exrates

[30-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> whale was doing it before these issues arised

[30-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> nothing makes sense lol

[30-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> true, true

[30-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[30-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> whale moves are killing price and now this.

[30-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> hope issues fix soon

[30-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> a very bumpy start to eqli especially for those who bought ico or presale.. no choice but to hodl though

[30-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> good buy time in my eyes.  but not good look on the charts.

[30-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I cant wait for masternodes üëå

[30-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Masternode?

[30-Jul-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, masternodes would have caught this far faster than the sharp eyes of webmaster01... though he caught it before the software did üòÑ

[30-Jul-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Anyway, we're double checking everything and making sure of the fixe(s). If you're running Agama, make sure it's the latest release or compiled from the master branch as of about ten days ago.

[30-Jul-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If you're running Komodod, same deal. If you're running Komodo Ocean, you may have to switch to Agama, but don't be in a hurry, because I'm not sure of my data on that yet.

[30-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> TY @Biomech-Founder

[30-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> hope coins are safe can you tell the reason behind the fork?

[30-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> was intentional or with mallicious fork?

[30-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> litemode not working again for me lol

[30-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> At this point, I can only speculate, but it's informed speculation. Not intentional.

[30-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> There were several updates to komodo over the course of this coin, I missed one a few days before the fork. I'm pretty obsessive about it, so of course the one I missed is critical üòõ But in my testing over the last couple days, the newest version catches the chain and sees the fork almost immediately, older versions do not. It wasn't flagged as a critical update, but even so, it seems to be the cause.

[30-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The coin supply and other key metrics are fine before and after, and no unusual network traffic, so to the best of my ability to track it, this does not seem to be malicious or deliberate in any way. Just one of those things üò¶

[30-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @CombatWombat I'm on it. Gimme a few minutes to check the servers.

[30-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üëç

[30-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> is good news then will watch for updates on the issues

[30-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Thanks. Gonna go silent for a bit, testing, but I'm all over this mess, and so are a few other people. I once again want to shout out to the Komodo developers and Chainmakers. Their assistance has been invaluable in getting this resolved. And I'm pretty sure I'll be buggin' 'em again in the future üòÑ

[30-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> üí™

[30-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> ok see you!

[30-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @CombatWombat try closing Agama, double check you have version 2.41, and then reopening it. I just reset one SPV server and was able to both connect and send a transaction on the proper chain.

[30-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Oh, I'm still red üòõ Ooops.

[30-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> is possible for wallet to show 11 confs  but exrates to show  only 3 ?

[30-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yes.

[30-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Biomech-Founder It was working earlier but now it decided to change its mind

[30-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They are updating cyclically, not in real time. True of most exchanges.

[30-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Usually a little behind.

[30-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and yes 2.41

[30-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, try switching servers.

[30-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> done that

[30-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ill open up the wallet and try again

[30-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok.

[30-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> by this rate i might memorize my pass phrase lol

[30-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Let me know, cuz it worked fine on my end literally a minute before I tagged you üòÑ

[30-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Now, I'm gonna try native mode again. It stuck on the latest komodo ocean, but we'll see with Agama in minutes.

[30-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> is EQLI looking for new exchange? exrates piss me off.

[30-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yes, and me too.

[30-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They're pretty easy to deal with, but I swear they're running on DOS or something üòõ

[30-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> nope not working biomech

[30-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok... That ain't makin' sense, @CombatWombat .

[30-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, not callin' you nothing üòÑ Just confused.

[30-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> is there a newer version for the komodoocean wallet?

[30-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> this entire thing doesn't make sense lol
