[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nice one linkara. Me too, been working a month as a systems engineer, long hours but keeps a roof over my head. Will be house sitting soon and wont be spending 40% of my wage on rent 😬 it's so expensive to live in western countries

[13-Feb-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Dying to build my own dome. Minimalist living on the cards for me, a nice small modest dome maybe scalable for future expansion
