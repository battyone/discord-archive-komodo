[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I used to build single brick veneer houses years ago and they often only have 10 year warranties with cracks forming before

[20-Jul-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> not all, I knew some real good builders that took pride in their job and did quality work. Its when people subdivide land and throw up cheap tiny houses quickly at premium price

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Do the monolithic domes needs structural repairs after so long?

[21-Jul-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> No, structural integrity is solid which is why they last through hurricanes and tornados

[21-Jul-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Very nice

[21-Jul-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jul-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If I recall correctly, a monolithic dome should need minor structural repairs about twice per millennium.
