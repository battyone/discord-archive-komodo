[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @MySoulisNotForSale

[05-Jul-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs like you look for ways to complain daily. Look for reasons to be thankful instead my friend

[05-Jul-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Choose your battles, @CowboyCrypto- Founder ... Not much to be thankful about if you're aware of the history of the United States, which used to be plural...

[05-Jul-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Gotta have a breathing license in the "land of the free" these days. We're overdue for a new revolution. Ghandi style, I should think.

[05-Jul-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> @Biomech you right

[05-Jul-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> This country bomb my county. Send terrorists. Kill innocent. Always same history

[05-Jul-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm thankful for things daily. Waking up being the first of them.

[05-Jul-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And u already know choosing battles is only fun for me if it‚Äôs multiple choice and there is an all of the above option

[05-Jul-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> @CowboyCrypto you wonder why America hated. Is evils empire

[05-Jul-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763

The land of the free and the home of the brave. The place where you go to jail for collecting rainwater and you get sued for calling a man a He.
