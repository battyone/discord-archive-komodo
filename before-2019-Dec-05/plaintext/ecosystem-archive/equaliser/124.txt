[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> maybe let me see in a second

[19-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im dealing with something currently lol

[19-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I thought equaliser would have exchange code of EQLI and not EQL

[19-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> correct @✌Jellysmash✌

[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> that's a question i was wondering 😄

[19-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Maybe it was too late to change it

[19-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It doesnt really matter but just checking with them how they messed that up and also spelled us Equalizer

[19-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Look up Bitcoin Cash on Binance and Cryptopia, BCC and BCH, respectively. Doesnt matter  👍

[19-Jul-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah I am not happy with the way this is going thus far lol

[19-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the buy walls I have built have been dumped on everytime i try to build them, and people are selling at like 40 satoshis....

[19-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That is literally a massive loss no matter how early you got in. The math isnt adding up at all....

[19-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> No doesn't really matter

[19-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm a holder

[19-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> HODL

[19-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well alot of people are. Just tryin to make sure the exchange isnt manipulating the market.

[19-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Can't understand people dumping

[19-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there's no reason at all to.

[19-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> oh well, I will buy them out and then i'll own their coins too 😄

[19-Jul-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> I'm a holder

[19-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> its all anticipated costs, but i honestly figured sales would be geared towards them getting profits. Im looking at other options currently. No worries.

[19-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I just don't get people who sell now at this much of a loss

[19-Jul-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And it's with a lot more coins

[19-Jul-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I seriously think the exchange is "printing coins"

[19-Jul-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> i need this printer
