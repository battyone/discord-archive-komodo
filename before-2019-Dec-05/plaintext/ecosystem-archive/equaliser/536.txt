[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im going to pour out 3 different combinations of blocks to be tested. each will give us data that is imperative to our success. The stability and load bearing qualities are the most important to me currently.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hi all. What's going down, Charlie Brown? 😂

[08-Jan-19 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Well I know crypto markets will be up this year, plenty of news on the wire about the global economy and 'everything' bubbles. 2018 Was the year of a healthy economic cycle correction for crypto.

[08-Jan-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Everything else is so dangerously overinflated including property. But they will always find a way to keep property inflated, having said that, please see dot point 2 in #welcome-invite 👌
