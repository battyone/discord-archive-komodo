[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In other news, positive news, I have withdrawn a signficant amount of EQL from exrates. It appears some idiot is dumping, rather than any shady games.

[24-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Cypher longer than any of us 😄 he built the server.

[24-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hit limit today

[24-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’ll hit it again tomorrow

[24-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I didn't, but I got a lot off. My most recent withdrawal only took about four hours. For exrates, that's fast.

[24-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'll buy it back cheap 😄

[24-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> did you all ever figure out where those coins are coming from? How on earth can they have so many coins when you didn't even send them more than 100 to test their wallet?

[24-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It has to be somebody who bought during presale or dICO.

[24-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It has to be ppl dumping that got in early and wants to lose money

[24-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Why they would crash their investment is beyond me, but these are legit or they wouldn't come to my wallet.

[24-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> eql was never at 14 satoshi .. was it?

[24-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No.

[24-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> so how the hell?

[24-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Lowest, absolute lowes was about 1300 sats. And that was less than a hundred thousand coins.

[24-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It got dumped hard on exrates and we are just accumulating at the bottom now

[24-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I got some far out theories... But I don't know anyone we pissed off that badly. Or really at all.

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Andy prob made em mad

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> LOL

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Only if he was drunk.

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> maybe it's the MOSSAD

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hey, if Israel wants to sell 'em cheap, who am I to judge? 😈

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Though frankly, they've never displayed that level of stupidity. Knesset, maybe...

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "Israel" would be trying to milk the money, not the other way around . .

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That's what I'm sayin 😄

[24-Jul-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Now, the US congress, they love to waste money. Not many of 'em smart enough to operate something as complex as a Windows computer, let alone a block chain, but they have servants...

[24-Jul-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> At any rate we will sit tight and see how this plays out while we continue to move forward.

[24-Jul-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I will say this for Exrates their customer service is amazing

[24-Jul-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’d like to get an army amassed and get 500 votes for coinex

[24-Jul-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 👍

[24-Jul-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'll vote

[24-Jul-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Go Eql

[24-Jul-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Or EQLI

[24-Jul-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Lol

[24-Jul-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Either works 😄 But let's try to settle on EQLI. Less ruffled feathers.

[24-Jul-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And aside from withdrawals, I have to agree with Evan regarding Exrates customer service. They answer quick.

[24-Jul-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Site  is not exactly optimal, but it's workable.

[24-Jul-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It all depends if we get our cmc listing as EQL then it’s a race to exchanges

[24-Jul-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> definitely will vote here haha

[24-Jul-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I should go host some seminars and make that part of the class

[24-Jul-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That sounds fun 😄

[24-Jul-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You gotta vote for us to get listed on coinex😂

[24-Jul-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
