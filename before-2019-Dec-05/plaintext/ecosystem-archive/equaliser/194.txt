[26-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> are you a Hillary fan

[26-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> or the opposite?

[26-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's a funny look on her face

[26-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im not a fan of ploitics in general. but i thoght the face was funny.

[26-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> maybe like when she found out that her husband 'messed up' a dress

[26-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> haha...imagine a chick saving the dress that some guy blew a load on

[26-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes thats what i thought too. too funny to pass up. im sure there are many of trump with similarly dumb expressions on his fazce

[26-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> face

[26-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, I'm sure there are lots of them

[26-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> mostly found in memes these days

[26-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Hi  everyone

[26-Jul-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <shah1305> 👋

[26-Jul-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> good day. keeping good?

[26-Jul-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <addi> good afternoon ✌

[26-Jul-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> keeping well thks - have there been airdops of  1 eql to people? was surprised my balance went up by 1 which is either  hell of a rain storm or something different 😃

[26-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> also - any plans to have some EQL liquidity / providers in BarterDex / HyperDex?

[26-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Hola all

[26-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You mean being able to purchase in barterdex / hyperdex?

[26-Jul-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I just woke up, @miles but yes, we'll put something back up on barterdex. Only reason it isn't is my server crashed 😄 There'll be something up later today.

[26-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Meantime, the dumper seems to be running out of steam on exrates, so that's your best bet to get 'em cheap.

[26-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> what price are they trading at on exrates? i havent looked

[26-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> or should i say what price is the dumper leaning on it?

[26-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> yes - cant see anything there to buy at the mo

[26-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 8 satoshis currently.

[26-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ty

[26-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> miles, I'm rebooting my DO server as we speak. We will never go as lowball as the idiot on exrates, but I'll put up a couple nice ones.

[26-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> we just need some strong buying power on exrates

[26-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and then some strong buy orders

[26-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> much higher of course

[26-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yep. Our main strategy has been to give the idiot rope... and buy his cheap shit, undercut him by a small amount until he has to cannibalize his higher orders. It's a numbers game. We got more, but so far I've used his own money against him. It's working. Throwing away money is an unsustainable game when the other side is playing to win 😈

[26-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And technically we weren't supposed to be listed til tomorrow. By which time I hope this idiot's back is broke.

[26-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah but there are a fair bit of sell orders until we reach even half of ico price

[26-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> people should be swallowing these orders up

[26-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, there should be EQL available on Barterdex. Let's see if y'all can discover them. BTC and Komodo markets.

[26-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i would rather buy on exrates for now 😂

[26-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, I really thought that people would scoop up the cheap shit quick.

[26-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Miles asked me why there weren't orders on Bdex, or if we'd have a liquidity server up. I just woke up and I'm like, "what? I got that ..." and my DEX server had crashed 😄

[26-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Fixed now.

[26-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 👌

[26-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> we should start some kind of Twitter campaign

[26-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i was thinking maybe a give away of some sort? get people to retweet.. like the official eql page.. join discord

[26-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But yeah, right now the bargains are on exrates, and the sooner this maroon is done for, the sooner real investors can play. Without losing money, the price has to be equivalent to AT LEAST 11 cents USD.

[26-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> only 665 followers on twitter... that's no way near enough

[26-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> CW, we're talking about next steps, and something along those lines will happen soon.

[26-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> no one knows about this project we need to get the word out

[26-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @Biomech-Founder  - thanks, - sadly i am no whale about to splurge 😉 but was interested to see if there would be regular liquidity in BDex

[26-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ok well let us know when you are ready... will get ready to retweet 😃

[26-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No worries @miles , it made me look. It should have been up and I didn't notice it wasn't till you said so.

[26-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> Holle 😃
