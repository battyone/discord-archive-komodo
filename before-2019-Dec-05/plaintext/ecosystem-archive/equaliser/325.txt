[16-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Hey @Faisal , just realised I wasn't following you on twitter

[16-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I am now

[16-Aug-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think it's important in crypto to support and buy in on those projects that have meaning for you

[16-Aug-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Something more than pure speculation

[16-Aug-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think the whole investment thing becomes more fulfilling and fun

[16-Aug-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> And if the coin goes to the moon then that's great, but as long as you feel fulfilled by it

[16-Aug-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> That's what gives meaning to your own life

[16-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Been low volume on Exrates for a little while

[16-Aug-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> No change in EQLI

[16-Aug-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's gonna change when the bounty programs kick in...big time

[16-Aug-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> @MySoulisNotForSale  no im talking about present tense not past tense

[16-Aug-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> doesnt matter if they went to moon before or not, what matters is that they have the means right now

[16-Aug-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> we're soon in the age of travelling to overseas with rockets so moonbase isnt that far away

[16-Aug-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> if you dont believe me. look up BFR by space x

[16-Aug-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Ok

[16-Aug-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> the reason why theres a space force being applied right now because people will fight over space resources soon ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Aug-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm sure they will

[16-Aug-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> i wonder if australian defense force will join in ðŸ˜›

[16-Aug-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> They wouldn't have the money required to do that

[16-Aug-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> There is such a thing?

[16-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> ðŸ˜‚

[16-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Australia is already over $1 trillion in debt.

[16-Aug-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> The current fashion of new house design in Sydney are all 2 storey boxes, painted dark grey, with flat roofs.

[16-Aug-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah houses look the same here and cheaply built at a huge markup

[16-Aug-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Aug-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Aug-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Aug-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> And if you can build them using a 3D printer then that's amazing

[16-Aug-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> And cheaper construction

[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> They just donâ€™t make shows like they used to

[16-Aug-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Aug-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Most comedy is American now

[16-Aug-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> Itâ€™s rubbish reality tv these days
