[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Good morning @K00l1  and everyone 👋

[24-Oct-18 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> @Jonathan-Admin  hi

[24-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I haven't seen that before, 2 level-ups one after the other 😂

[24-Oct-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> lol me neither

[24-Oct-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Albeit K00l1 has the least interesting comment for a level-up in the history of tipsy level-up comments LOL

[24-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Maybe he's a bot @AndronicusBass-Founder - the daily timing is consistent to be programable

[24-Oct-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Morning ☕

[24-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 🍵

[24-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm at a scrum/agile conference for 2 days

[24-Oct-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Trying to improve software development process

[24-Oct-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i bet they will talk about implementing some crap certification to supposedly set standards and you have to pay for out of your own pocket like ITIL  LOL

[24-Oct-18 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Who knew common sense would be so expensive in the 21st century

[24-Oct-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> have fun @✌Jellysmash✌

[24-Oct-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> 😃

[24-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass Lmao......a course in common sense...that's ITIL...haha

[24-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> On my way home now...had an American speaker at the end that tried to get the audience involved.... it's not quite the same in Australia...Less likely to fall for that Oprah style approach

[24-Oct-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> She tried but couldn't get the audience chearing and air punching

[24-Oct-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> LOL. Cant go wrong with an Aussie telling it like it is, especially on a Michael McIntyre's roadshow which is highly regarded https://youtu.be/j89mEHL6Y74

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Ha, I'll have to watch when I get home

[24-Oct-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Not 1 person has said it is BS. Aussies tell it like it is. We investigate banks, as well as the other half that bury their head in the sand and think saving money is the best policy 🤣 I didnt know dollarmites were still going, I grew up with that in primary school

[24-Oct-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Dollarmites.

[24-Oct-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Don't forget Creds.

[24-Oct-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Creds helps kids discover how to get into debt using credit cards.

[24-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Who did creds?

[24-Oct-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Credit is broad money supply.

[24-Oct-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> that's hilarious....Steve Hughes...he's spot on about the political correctness

[24-Oct-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass-Founder

[24-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Health and safety regulations now...replaced common sense

[24-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> my favoutite quote:   "I want to live in a democracy but I don't want to be offended"..

[24-Oct-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I had to google what are dollarmites.
