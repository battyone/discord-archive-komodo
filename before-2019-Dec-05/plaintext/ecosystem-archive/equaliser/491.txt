[29-Oct-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> It is exciting everything going on here xD Definitely looking forward to the future

[29-Oct-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> In Australia, the government is rolling out a new welfare type debit card to replace normal welfare payments.

[29-Oct-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> The new cards have certain products like alcohol and drugs blacklisted

[29-Oct-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> So they can't waste money on those items

[29-Oct-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> There's been a lot of community response where they are asking to have that system implemented in their community because they have large alcohol problems

[29-Oct-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> If those communities had the option of something like the Equaliser solution I can guarantee they'll be asking for it.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @jellysmash it is a mixed opinion about the debit welfare cards however my dream is to one day help native Australians doing it tough. We have to make sure they are ok because their culture and Bush Tucker knowledge is amazing to me. I grew up watching Bush Tucker man on ABC and learning the culture through his documentaries was my favourite. Atleast government housing where we can build much cheaper.

[29-Oct-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, I've seen the mixed opinion on the new welfare debit card. As a tax payer I think it's good, and enough people in the communities also like it because it means more money for food, housing and providing for their kids.

[29-Oct-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I forgot to mention that I do like the initiative 😊  I recall it was a trial at some stage however, I haven't been up to date with the progress of their plan or if it will be rolled out to a broader populous. There are so many that do the right thing and genuinely need hardship assistance so by having that solution which increases allowance especially the extra help for the kids is awesome. I know I would love to get involved and support indigenous programs to get younger generations into building, given that the future job environment is leaning towards automation and A.I.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Breakfast of champions. It was my daily routine for many years however, only once in a while these days, most of the time is vaping and reduced nic. Steep learning curve to start vaping but worth it. Cigarettes in australia is daylight robbery unfortunately.

[29-Oct-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Pack of 20 is is $20-30 AUD

[29-Oct-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It was a long winter which went into spring but today was a great day, I went into the city to the botanic gardens, had a look at many plants and flowers for some practical research into what could work nicely with some of the designs of the homes we have planned and of course what climates they thrive in. Each are different 😃

[29-Oct-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Well i don't like vaping or other stuff... cigarettes are the beste for me... here a pack of 20 ciga is aprox 3.8 euro .... i smoke like 40 ciga per day.... 😂 😂 😂  i pay more for smoking and less for food 😂 😂 😂 😂

[29-Oct-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Do people still satirize vaping these days? It is very common to vape in Australia, it's not a hipster thing to do. Many people have had success giving up smoking because of it. Cigarettes are taxed very highly in Australia.

[29-Oct-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> I'm not nothing... i have the taste of vaping.... i just don't like.... and is my taste.... besides i've noticed that latin people love cigarettes and dislike vaping... 😀 😂

[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Good Morning🤗

[29-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass-Founder actually the new welfare card was developed by the company I work for, for the government. I helped develop it.  It was on a trail basis now for at about 2 years at rural indiginous commununtiites.  After the first trial, other aborginal communities were asking for it in their community becasue they too had the same problems with all the money the family got spent on alcohol and tabacco and gambling, etc, and it was the kids that missed out on getting food on the table. The government announced a couple of weeks ago that it will now roll out the new debit card in the Bundaberg region in Queensland, which should be interesting as it's a more 'mainstream' community, but has a lot of welfare.  My wife has cousins in that area so it'll be interesting to see any differences they may notice.  At work we have a couple of months of work to make changes to the system before the government will roll it out.  I won't be working on it this time, but I'm keen to hear about the changes and how well the system gets accepted in Bundaberg.

[29-Oct-18 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass-Founder  I know what you mean about the mixed feelings about the new debit card, because we've had  a couple of protests outside our building in relation to it.  Apparantly those getting welfare think that it's their right to spend it on drugs and alcohol.

[29-Oct-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Oct-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Woah, the world truly is a small place. When i first heard about it a few years ago on ABC 24 back in the day when I used to watch free to air TV, I thought it was a neat idea. Expected to have backlash however, I believe traditional elders of indigenous australian communities have been wanting something to help with the issue. If I was in government, I will want to do what ever it takes to nurture  indigenous culture and skills, not just name city hotspots with native tribe names, know what I mean?

[29-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
