[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> i rarely go on telegram, honestly i completely forget about it. i very much dislike it lol. so i am almost never on it. but i can try and get myself to hop on it a little more and see if anyone needs answering to questions  and stuff

[18-Jul-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <edsky> I agree I hardly use telegram also just so much spam

[18-Jul-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> yeah . . crypto = cia, nsa, mossad . . . hopefully. . the mossad part is minor, and that some good factions of the cia and nsa are working for "the people" (us)

[18-Jul-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> how are yall doing?

[18-Jul-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> but you know, when money is involved, the mossad/zionists are not far behind, if not taking the lead.

[18-Jul-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
