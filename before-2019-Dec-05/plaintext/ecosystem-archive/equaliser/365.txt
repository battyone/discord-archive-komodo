[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> no shit

[23-Aug-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> was about $4 at the dICO

[23-Aug-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah that hurts

[23-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Still plenty to do that doesnt require spending any funds, waiting for better market contitions, I think before the end of the year things will be up alot

[23-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> can I put kmd in the same wallet as eql?

[23-Aug-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It works but to be sure I would keep a separate address

[23-Aug-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> mine are in the same address

[23-Aug-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Ive tested KMD and EQLI in the same address, its so awesome.

[23-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah i got mine in the same address... have only withdrawn eqli though

[23-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think other komodo asset chains can use the same address too

[23-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah they are all the same address?

[23-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> sort of like eth/erc20

[23-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> but much much much better

[23-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> dont have to spend KMD to send out EQLI

[23-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> hate that about eth

[23-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "petrol"

[23-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> haha poop

[23-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> the one good thing about fcoin is.. it showed us how crap etherium really is

[23-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> CZ says eth and eos arent scalable in the long run and wont last

[23-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> bass did you see what happened to eth because of the fcoin exchange?

[23-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> No

[23-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> remember when eth got really slow and expensive not that long ago?

[23-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> fcoin had some listing/voting thing going on where people would vote with erc20 tokens

[23-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Had my head down in research this week, I need to get out the house one day,

[23-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> so people were sending in small transactions.. heaps of them

[23-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> and yeah etherium went really slow and got really expensive

[23-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I remeber reading about eth getting slow from crypto kitties ages ago, is that right?

[23-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> eth could not handle it... so how they think they can go main stream?

[23-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> no not crypto kitties.. this was worse

[23-Aug-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> just google Fcoin etherium

[23-Aug-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> yes that's right

[23-Aug-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
