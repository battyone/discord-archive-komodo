[14-Aug-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Especially when the globe sees how awesome these homes are

[14-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah im talking about the general market

[14-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> people dont even know about eqli... but when you tell people they all seem interested

[14-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> but i think the current market might be scaring some people

[14-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Thats a true statement.

[14-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> There are firesales on ebay

[14-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah big sales but they might dip some more

[14-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> People always panic but they don't realize that this isn't a short term game like making a quick buck off the latest trend

[14-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah I agree but I don't think we were expecting this

[14-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> i was close to panic selling a few times... would of actually been better if i did panic sell first time around i would be up a bit

[14-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> but now i just hold

[14-Aug-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> i dont really care if my portfolio goes to 0... i don't think it ever will and I don't want it too but if it does im ok

[14-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Same here, patience and confidence goes a long way :linktriforce:

[14-Aug-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> They say patience is a virtue

[14-Aug-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Yes that dumper dumped over 2 million EQLI....it was a big dump

[14-Aug-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I had 2 orders filled but wish I had put them lower

[14-Aug-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Longer term it won't matter

[14-Aug-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Surely that dumper must be out of EQLI

[14-Aug-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I guess only time will tell
