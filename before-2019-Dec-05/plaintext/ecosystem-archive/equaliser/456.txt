[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> So I ask again? What is the price of eql? And are we going to be listed on any other exchanges?

[21-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> My blockfolio has eql at $0 right now

[21-Sep-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Exrates now, about 45 sats when I last checked

[21-Sep-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> As far as other exchanges go, yes, not sure which ones...the founders are working on it.
