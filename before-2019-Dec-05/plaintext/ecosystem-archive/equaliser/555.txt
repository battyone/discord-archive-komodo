[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Yes thank you, the future is bright for crypto and renewables.

[15-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> there is a project that lets you earn crypto for using them as a supplier

[15-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> the name escapes me at the moment but indeed the world is changing

[16-Jun-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here, we have regained access to the twitter account. We will still be moving it to a new account going forward, but it's in our control again üòÑ

[16-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Further, I am working on a draft of our new plans today. It will probably not be fully reviewed and ready to post before next weekend, but we have met with a few people and sought advice... We are now sifting that advice and developing a plan of action. I told y'all we'd report regularly from now on, and we will. Some weeks it may be "nothing to report", but you'll at least get that üòÑ

[16-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> @Jonathan-Admin let me know when and where ya gonna be and I will let ya talk that shit to me in person.

[18-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> as for the team. they have removed me from most everything I have noticed. I have been out cutting trees for the past few weeks getting area ready for concrete so havent been doin much on social media. If you guys want me out, thats what you have.

[19-Jun-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Awesome, thank you and have a nice day

[19-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Apologies everyone for the last 2 statements

[19-Jun-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> My slander button is on but I think everyone gets the point

[19-Jun-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> well what is everyones thoughts on Libra Coin ?

[19-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> To be honest, I don't like it's from facebook. I do think it is an awsome chance to get people in crypto world, but first lets see how it play's out and how many people will actually move into other coins from there on. But overal, lots of people will get in contact with crypto, so all fine. I do wonder if it will be connected with btc pairs or if they even list on exchanged, or if they keep it for themselves.

[19-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> hmm well form what i can see 
Libra seems to be interesting it has a new programming lang called move for its smart contracts its open source and test net there is two coins on it 1k transactions per secs, 10sec finality times (confirmations i am assuming), there is no blocks on this chain different to a traditional blockchain, also no KYC on the protocol, however the dapps built on it may have, it has gas fees/transaction fees, not backed by USD but multiple currencies in a "basket of currencies". you make coins by depositing fiat and are burned when you withdraw. (stable coin?) calibra wallet works on facebook messenger whatsapp insta etc might add other crypto in future. based in Switzerland as a non profit, there are 28 members in the association (the companies mentioned yesterday) the target is 100 to start before hitting public, facebook at the moment  has 1% of the vote to control the network.  if you want to join the group you have to pay 10 million USD along side other requirements. only a 30% of the members can be blockchain related companies to stop them commandeering it and allow the more customer facing companies to have a say, it sounds fair so far, . there is the investment token for governance the guys who run it and the libra coin for use like a normal currency (similar to makerDOW crypto)

[19-Jun-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Don't forget, they're in it for the money lol

[19-Jun-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> ofc and a smart way to do it

[19-Jun-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> since facbook only have 1% of it  they make money from tx fees and interest from the fiat baskets

[19-Jun-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich> U. S. A is not happy that they will do that with a bank from switzerland. So i think lets first see. Dont think they can do that so easy

[19-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there will be regulatory hurdles and since the company is already in the spotlight regarding regulation and selling user information, it will be a diffucult road. but i do believe 2 things about Libra
1 - it will introduce the global masses to "cryptocurrency" and open the door for other projects to gain exposure
2 - it will allow FB to become a payment processing platform in ways that not many people cant imagine. and while this will take years i forsee FB as being THE leader taking away market share from other payment processors like PYPL etc and building an ecosystem on par with AAPL

[20-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea agree  @c2k

[20-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It will take market share away from the micro project cryptocurrencies

[20-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Even btc may slide as Libra becomes the world wide currency

[20-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> However problem is it'll be pegged to fiat

[20-Jun-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> have a nice day everyoneüññ

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @adriana Kicked him out

[22-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> üëå

[22-Jun-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lots of these people seem to appear randomly from multiple discords

[22-Jun-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> i wonder what settings does this server have for security

[22-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't know, but people can join in any discord server if they get an invite from someone

[22-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> yeah..

[22-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> its so annoying

[22-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They don't even have to chat to pm people, so nothing to do about it. They probably find way's to get around bans, like creating new accounts

[22-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I get them at least a few times each 1-2 weeks

[22-Jun-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Most of the times they come from the same server, and then later they pop up again, just be sure to block them in case they keep using their accounts to spam

[22-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> yeah

[22-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> i do that all the time

[22-Jun-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I actually don't know how the rest of the team handles it, but if people don't have any chat history in here, I believe people on what they say. But if people somehow have a chat history, it's good to provide a screenshot. Some of these spammers do chat in discords, but mostly are just quiet joiners

[22-Jun-19 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> There are discord privacy settings that you can set up for your account. If you set it to public and allow all to send you messages than that's what happens. You can change your settings to limit cold calls but then maybe legitimate messages may not get through to you.

[22-Jun-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> right changed security settings now up a rank it is getting annoying thats the 5th person this few days

[23-Jun-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Volume will pick up eventually if things turn for the positive side which we are confident they will

[24-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here this ain't in announcements because this week there's not a lot to say. We have been doing some more planning, we have the rough sketch of a plan and have consulted with a couple of people who are candidates for the new team. That being said, I had a ridiculously tough week and didn't get near the amount done that I wanted to, and Cypher much the same. 
But we promised updates, even if it was "nothing to report ". Today it's that, except that we will have an informal game plan posted up next weekend. Rough draft is done, the team is reviewing it for errors, grammar, and excess enthusiasm. See y'all next weekend if not before!

[24-Jun-19 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> are the SPV servers down?

[24-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> The servers will be down from now onwards the coin works in native mode just not lite mode maintenance of the servers is too costly in our current state we are working on a solution so don't worry too much üí™

[24-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ok was just wondering as I have all of my coins in the address in lite mode :/
