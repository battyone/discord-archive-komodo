[dscrdeql] <javadth> @✌Jellysmash✌ you think matrix is good film to watch for a kid ?

[23-Nov-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> its too complicated i think

[23-Nov-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Matrix is an amazing movie

[23-Nov-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've watched Jurassic Park 1 since I was like 5-6 years old. I liked it a lot as a kid, but over the years I came to understand more about what happened in the movie and I have to say I really like how I learned bits and peaces whenever I rewatched it every few years later

[23-Nov-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Movie of spiritual awakening

[24-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> It’s a matter of time

[24-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I can feel it

[24-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So no debt on that, and I’ll keep making blocks until I have enough for a house.

[24-Nov-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Then I’ll knock out foundation and go put it together.

[24-Nov-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Insider info here: once I sell it, putting half the money into btc to buy EQLI

[24-Nov-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So if it sells for 130k and Btc goes down to 3k, ummm... well
