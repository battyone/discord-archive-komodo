[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nah. Not really

[10-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This is an easily recovery

[10-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> we need to break these ridiculous prices or else it will become a level of support

[10-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> level of support should be much much much much higher

[10-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will be ok

[10-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yep 😃

[10-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have a plan 😁

[10-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But you are correct that it should be much higher

[10-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> even if EQLI gets to 1c that's a huge increase.    imagine when it gets to $1....OMG

[10-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> exactly my tyhought

[10-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> this is a new project. needs to be thought of in terms of months and years

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I don't want to look back and think...damnit I shoudl have bought more when it was less than half a cent.

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> we are going to have to plan an eqli meet up when that happens

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> 😄

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there will be not only good things done for less fortunate people...but large wealth accumulation by those who supported the project in its infancy

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yes, it's a win win situation

[10-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> agreed

[10-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i like the idea of meetups @CombatWombat-Mod . think once the vision becomes clearer and some of the roadmap gets accomplished a meetup room should be made and that effort should be pursued

[10-Aug-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> One day just need this market to pick up

[10-Aug-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> if this coin was around during last years bull run it imagine the price it would of hit

[10-Aug-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> 😱 😱

[10-Aug-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> HQ can be a design of ours, possibly.

[10-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> exrates is down hopefully doing upgrades again and hopefully not for long want to pick up some more eql 😄

[10-Aug-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Basically there are 4 parts to a dome: airform, insulation, rebar skeleton, concrete

[10-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
