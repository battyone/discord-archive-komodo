[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Exactly, the white paper is made for transparency but the key points are what matters. I have pinned in this channel but good idea, i can create a new channel that is information only and no permissions to chat

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Need to wake up properly

[11-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Hi

[11-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> @AndronicusBass-Founder very nice explanation above!

[11-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Hi there @donaldmathers

[11-Jul-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> What‚Äôs going on

[11-Jul-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Sadly, that is the issue in any country that has allowed central banks to control their currency.

[11-Jul-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> The 2008 market crash in the US was a direct result of overextending loans to people whom they KNEW could not make the payments.

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Flate> Correct

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Flate> Banks just wanted to toss out money

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> They were printing money.

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Flate> And even though you know it'll crash

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> for themselves

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Flate> They did it anyway

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> indeed, sub prime. Same thing is happening in australia in the form of interest only loans which are going to have rates increased and people will need to start paying the principal too

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Flate> Becuase greed is greed and shit happens

[11-Jul-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> a band aid fix is rapid population growth

[11-Jul-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Flate> And then we collapse

[11-Jul-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Yup

[11-Jul-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Band aid

[11-Jul-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> rapid population growth = pro-life = more money at the top and less for the middle and lower....

[11-Jul-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> thats a loose association, but seems relevant. No initiatives are put forth to assist the growing population, they just want the number to grow.

[11-Jul-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> the "people" have allowed it, albeit through convoluted political policies and lies, and the people will wonder what happened when it all comes crashing down.

[11-Jul-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Terre was a good movie made of that US housing crash

[11-Jul-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> never heard of it. I will have to give it a watch

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Christian bale wad the main actor

[11-Jul-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
