[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I feel like  @adriana is someone of someone....if that makes sense

[26-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> huh??

[26-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> @ $10-15

[26-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> im someone of someone?

[26-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well.. with our current idiot dumper, not very much. But realistically, the last legit price on Barterdex was app, it should be around .26 USD per EQL.

[26-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Like you know someone here sorry

[26-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And the dumper will be broke soon üòà

[26-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> yeah @Cypher - Founder

[26-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Yup. Knew it lol

[26-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> I don't understand early dumpers... like... I mean at LEAST wait until the first real big wave lol

[26-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy dev (auscoi)> Like running into the ocean with a surf board and riding along the sand

[26-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> t!level @NWhiskeyTango

[26-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I really don't understand it, because nobody got nothin' for free except rain and bounties. And that doesn't add up. Somebody spent a LOT of money to lose money. But hey, whatever the point of it, we didn't get sucked in. If they were trying to get a panic sell, they really seriously blew it.

[26-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Lol ya

[26-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @adriana if Agama gives you any trouble, most of us in here use it. We can and will be happy to help.

[26-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> where do i download it?

[26-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> on komodo ?

[26-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Jussec, I'll grab the link.

[26-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> much love

[26-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but who would have that much EQL to lean on it so much @Biomech-Founder  ...would have to be an insider no?

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @c2k We thought so, but we've accounted for everyone that got it on pre dICO sales, and nobody dumped. So it had to be somebody who bought on the dICO, and they paid AT LEAST 10 cents

[26-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It makes no sense, unless somebody is trying to wreck the project.

[26-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hmmm

[26-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> good morning everyone! just stopping in for a few. hope you all are having a great day!

[26-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And the sale wasn't big enough to make that happen. All we have to do is wait them out and repurchase as much cheap EQL as feasible. I recommend y'all do the same üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> I wonder why so cheap to sell?

[26-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> there are always haters

[26-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> seems so  bizarre

[26-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Because it won't stay at these prices. This is one person or one group being fuckheads. If they were trying to get early holders to dump it cheap and control the market, they failed big time and at high cost. Which I find strangely satisfying. When an enemy defeats themselves, it saves a lot of time and effort on my part üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Would still like to know who's neck it is though...

[26-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ah well.

[dscrdeql] <adriana> nice

[26-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No worries, @adriana

[26-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> glad everything is rather smooth for you guys

[26-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> i cant even think how hard it can be to pull something like this off

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I was once called the voice of reason by Greg Maxwell. Never happened before or since, but I'm friendly to newbies. In 2009, ALL crypto people were newbies.

[26-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I wouldn't call it smooth. We're just veterans üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> And how much was sold?
With such a decline in prices

[26-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> total, roughly 49 million coins.

[26-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats ~10% of the float no?

[dscrdeql] <c2k> np

[26-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Total supply is 500 million, So more like 5%. And this dumper (as near as we can tell) had to have bought a bunch on dICO, so they're gonna run out of steam real quick if we all start pickin' off the low hanging fruit and relisting it at end of ico prices üëø

[26-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> what does dumper mean
