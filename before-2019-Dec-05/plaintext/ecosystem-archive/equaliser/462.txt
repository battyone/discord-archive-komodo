[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is it safe to log in?

[22-Sep-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i have no idea

[22-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i honestly think the hack has something to do with their system... doesn't look like it has affected anything else for anyone

[22-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> normally they send you an email to confirm a withdrawal

[22-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no emails sent to me

[22-Sep-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I still got the 8k EQLI

[22-Sep-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah it has only affected some not all

[22-Sep-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> seriously that exchange is rlly bad firsit locking my account and now this.

[22-Sep-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> the onl thing that makes me happy is that I have my entire bag in my agama wallet.

[22-Sep-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good to hear that buddz

[22-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i have a bunch stuck there...see what happens

[22-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im sure cowboy is working on it today

[22-Sep-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I have over 600k EQLI there now..

[22-Sep-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you also have some in Agama wallet?

[22-Sep-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> were you able to request them for transfer out @Zach ?

[22-Sep-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I have have more than that in my wallet, I haven‚Äôt tried to withdraw yet because everyone was saying it was down

[22-Sep-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gotcha

[22-Sep-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i tried. got a message that said 'withdrawal is unavailable at this time'

[22-Sep-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah that‚Äôs what I was hearing was going on. I am out all morning with my kids doing some stuff so I will take a closer look this afternoon

[22-Sep-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CX-9> same as myself. Should i sell my equaliser or is all withdrawals down?? I just got my new seed and went into withdrawal. its down.

[22-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> withdrawal is down. not sure if for other coins or just eqli tho

[22-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CX-9> ok thank you @c2k

[22-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> np

[22-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> They said they are investigating it

[22-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thats all we currently know

[22-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> our coin is currently in maintenance mode

[22-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> meaning noone can withdraw or deposit

[22-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are you planning to get us listed on another exchange or are we keeping exrates?

[22-Sep-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I reached out to several last night

[22-Sep-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm gonna see what I can get done next week, but it‚Äôs kind of hard without funds

[22-Sep-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 3-5 btc is average listing cost

[22-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Did you hear anything from litebit?

[22-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not sure what their fee is to get listed

[22-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> i actually reached out to them earlier this morning

[22-Sep-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Any news from that or is it ü§ê ?

[22-Sep-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No response currently

[22-Sep-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm on it though so just be patient

[22-Sep-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> good evening!

[22-Sep-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> I know that Utrum (OOT) is listed on RightBTC and CoinExchange

[22-Sep-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yea I talk with Sri from Oot very frequently

[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> i have a question what is one way that the home you all are building going to be energy efficient

[22-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Aircrete offers amazing insulation ratings

[22-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> ah nice

[22-Sep-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And since the entire build system is using this method, dome or traditional then we will save by not needing to insulate and the tests on these blocks are amazing

[22-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> how many people are working on the project

[22-Sep-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> rn

[22-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> How would the aircrete stand up to say... a zombie horde? Asking for a friend

[22-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They'll climb over and continue üòÇ

[22-Sep-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I‚Äôm thinking dome though..

[22-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I meant, this is a high wall, and a dome is not that high, so they'll just go over it because of the shape haha. In that movie, the people behind the wall are not safe, no roof

[22-Sep-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> So an aircrete dome should be good as zombie defense, that‚Äôs what I will tell my friend

[22-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha...i like that movie with brad pitt in it

[22-Sep-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> with teh zombie horde

[22-Sep-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> great movie

[22-Sep-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> domes are great for anything apocolyptic

[22-Sep-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Vinsmokeüåπüç§> Goodnight everyone!

[22-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Domes can be as big as you want them to be

[22-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve build a few geodesics that were 100 ft in diameter and 60 ft high

[22-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That‚Äôs huge, geodesics don‚Äôt normally have multiple floors do they? Mostly for enclosing tall things?

[22-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> some can have internal multiple levels

[22-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> definitely

[22-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's easy because the dome doesn't require internal supports

[22-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so you can build walls and levels however you want

[22-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've seen pictures of 2 storey domes

[22-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the outside looks the samee....as a dome, but the inside has levels in it

[22-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You build a riser wall for it

[22-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve seen 4 story domes

[22-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> St. Louis science center is a massive dome

[22-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 4 levels

[22-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol there‚Äôs an imax inside of it

[22-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> So they shut down all wallets or just EQLI?

[22-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just ours

[22-Sep-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> good night

[22-Sep-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Could someone that hacked an account still trade for a different coin and then withdraw? Or trades are locked with EQL?

[22-Sep-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im just glad I took my 100$ in btc from that exchange . Tbh after this I would recommend to everyone not ever touch that exchange..

[22-Sep-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I would be srsly fumming if I had my bunch over there and got stolen..

[22-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> pity to hear about exrates

[22-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> guess it is hard to trust any exchange these days - looks a cryptohub

[22-Sep-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> DEX's will play a major role next year I reckon.

[22-Sep-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I made a decent amount of money on exrates, luckily I have already pulled out more than I put in so it wouldn‚Äôt be a total loss but I would be rather upset

[22-Sep-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Zach in my case they dumped my EQL for Btc and then dumped that for USD and then bought ETH and withdrew that, so simply shutting down withdrawals of EQL won't stop a hacker from taking coin

[22-Sep-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I have my suspicions on how the hacker got in, and have just emailed to exrates where I think they may have a vulnerability in their site (i'm a software developer with close to 30 years experience).

[22-Sep-18 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm waiting to hear back from them, to see how interested they are in getting my feedback

[22-Sep-18 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ironically I just did security training last week as part of my job. so a bit of a coincidence.

[22-Sep-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå I‚Äôm really sorry man, that‚Äôs a tough loss. Hackers weren‚Äôt even smart, they could have gone from EQL to BTC straight to ETH and probably gotten more. Was EQL all you had on there?

[22-Sep-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah man if it was just one of us ok maybe but theres a few of us affected has to be a vulnerability in their site

[22-Sep-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> No i had btc on there and ETH and had buy orders in  to buy more eql. they cancelled those orders and sold for usd adn then bought eth and withdrew that.

[22-Sep-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i did end up changing passwords for most things though just to be safe
