[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> ion 2011... btc was 1.5 $ ...  nobody believe will go to 20k 😂

[25-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> That’s one opinion i can find plenty of article to back my argument too beauty of the internet😄

[25-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> yea where did it go after 1.5k  back to  sub 200$

[25-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah edsky thats kind of the point I am trying to make

[25-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> this entire argument lies on tether not being backed by real money

[25-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> which could be true

[25-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but it could be false as well

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> if you cant see 100 mill  tetrher beinv pinteted  and used on the exchmages your are blind and blinded by btc

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Tether is backed by fiat. The only real question is whether it's 100 percent backed, or fractional.

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but people who think it isn't backed by real money will not accept anything other then tether being a scam

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thats the problem I have

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> they have already closed their minds

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and think they know it all

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> when in reality non of us know

[25-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> no tether is backed by nothing hence no audit ect

[25-Jul-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Untrue. I have personally withdrawn from the Tether foundation. It's not free, but it's too cheap to be bought at market in real time.

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> from the article you posted Magic... which was written in Feb

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> If the fact BTC hit $22K made you a genius, then the current price of $7K
and falling makes you what exactly? Now that the price is in free fall the
structural flaws inherent in the use of proof of work to finalize the
BlockChain are becoming clear. What we need to make sure of is that the
BitCoin circus and its chorus of ideological zealots don't kill legitimate
strong crypto.

Proof of Work is the worst way to do a BlockChain

Now that BitCoin is going back down to $0 is an opportunity to re-examine
the weakest link in the cockamamie scheme: Use of proof of work to finalize
a notary digest chain.

[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> wombat  I have not closed my mind..  if seems you have.   you want tether to have 100 billion to back the coin.. fact  they don't  they dont even prove they have money lol

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> to me that sounds like the person who wrote the article was expecting btc to drop to 0 pretty soon after writing it

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Not soon

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @MagicByt3 I clearly said I don't know

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Anyway, I gotta get my kids up. I think we shall just have to agree to disagree. It's adoption that will ultimately drive the price, even if Tether goes bust. And the innovations keep on a' comin' in crypto.

[25-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
