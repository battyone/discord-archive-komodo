[25-Jul-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> some one buying up all the cheap eqli

[25-Jul-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> On what exchange?

[25-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> exrates

[25-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well pretty much all sell orders are cheap

[25-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but there was finally a bit of buy action

[25-Jul-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I cant get exrates to work for some reason

[25-Jul-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> what problem you having?

[25-Jul-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> What‚Äôs eql selling for

[25-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> i dont know yet

[25-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> someone?

[25-Jul-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode> good afternoon eqlers

[25-Jul-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Someone with alot of money to burn is dumping it at a major loss. no one in their right mind would sell so low. I wish I was working my previous job to buy up big

[25-Jul-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> somebody just swept the low hanging fruit. The bargains ain't gonna last üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> There isn't any way to buy with usd is there?

[25-Jul-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe there is a pair.

[25-Jul-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Excellent, I must find this üòÉ

[25-Jul-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> holy moly, you can get 88k for $80

[25-Jul-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think our mission is making someone extremely nervous which only explains why someone sells so ridiculously low.

[25-Jul-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> just too cheap makes no sense

[25-Jul-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> they want to undermine the price is my opinion.  Like our smart contracts will negate the need for a realestate agent so could be a disgruntled agent.

[25-Jul-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> they make lots of money in fees

[25-Jul-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> probably some one manipulating it to buy up more

[25-Jul-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> no one really knows about this project yet

[25-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> one of many cost saving models for owning an affordable home

[25-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah, we havent hyped up like many projects, organic growth is quality. we are working on more ways to get the word out.

[25-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I did speak to someone from ABC australia that was in Puerto Rico doing a doco but we had just left

[25-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Acura> Few days ago i bought for 80$ ca 500k EQL üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Look at how many were sold in dICO, realize that less than that was sold on presale.... ask yourself how long this can be sustained. I gurantee you the Equaliser team is NOT going to throw our coin in the street.

[25-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Acura> On Exrates

[25-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah insanely cheap

[25-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> holy moly. if we reach $1 you are laughing haha

[25-Jul-18 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> will it b come???

[25-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Still haven't figured out how to buy eql on exrates with usd ü§î

[25-Jul-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> ‚òïÔ∏è

[25-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> sam as you would with btc

[25-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> i believe

[25-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> most exchanges use btc

[25-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> you could buy btc and then buy eql

[25-Jul-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> exrates supports usd

[25-Jul-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> where at? I know this is one of those right in front of me but missing it moments üòÜ

[25-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @CowboyCrypto will do

[25-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> wish eql was on an australian exchange like coinspot

[25-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> then could buy with Aussie dollar

[25-Jul-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> moving btc around is a bit expensive still

[25-Jul-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> some exchnages really rip you off when you withdraw btc

[25-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @Jonathan are you asking how to deposit usd, or just if there's a market? If it's the former, it's under Refill/Withdraw and they take payeer, perfectmoney, and two others that I can't seem to commit to memory üòõ

[25-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> advcash and nixmoney.

[25-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Great, thought it might be there. Thanks! @Biomech-Founder

[25-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I know nothing of those two. Perfectmoney and Payeer been around for a while, I think longer than Crypto.

[25-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Neither one works in the US, dammit.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Guys/gals we are working on sooooooo many things right now. We are currently trying to come up with a solid plan to get listed on coinex via the voting system

[25-Jul-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will need 500 votes

[25-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
