[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @c2k 2 sats? Wow that's low

[01-Aug-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ya, nasty low

[01-Aug-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Wish I had about 2 btc...

[01-Aug-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok...

[01-Aug-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> So, somebody who is probably in this discord is playing us for fools.

[01-Aug-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Every time one of you accepts these ridiculous buy orders, they're relisting those coins at twice what they paid.

[01-Aug-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They're killing the market by keeping it low and they're gaining back the coins. If you want the price to rise, stop playing. Sure, take the low sell offers, but don't accept the low buys!

[01-Aug-18 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> This game is only sustainable if the weak hands keep playing. Take this asswipe's coins from him, and don't sell them for next to nothing, he'll run out of fuel.

[01-Aug-18 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> at 100 satoshis, he's done.

[01-Aug-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yea it definitely smells fishy. ..esp given what u guys as the devs know

[01-Aug-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There‚Äôs something up with this for sure

[dscrdeql] <Llama> Is connecting with people on linkedin more of a casual thing, or is it more personal?

[01-Aug-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I finally figured out how to work the damn thing. There are bunch of orders on dex now

[01-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> First time I can think of something worked better on Windows than Linux

[01-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> is there a hyperdex tutorial video?

[01-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[01-Aug-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> this sounds familiar  . .

[01-Aug-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hyperdex doesn't let you make persistent orders. It cancels out after a short time. I've gone back to barterdex. It's a lot harder to work with, but you can put it to stay until cancelled or filled.

[01-Aug-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Think I'll try it with Wine, so I can run it on my droplet üòÑ

[01-Aug-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Much more consistent internet that way.

[01-Aug-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I thought I got a good deal at 14 satoshi

[01-Aug-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> You tipsy?

[01-Aug-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Oh no persistent orders?

[01-Aug-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jeremy> thanks

[01-Aug-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what is a persistent order

[01-Aug-18 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> bye all

[01-Aug-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> good until cancelled. DEX orders have a time limit, but if you set that flag, it recycles them.

[01-Aug-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @Jonathan  @Llama I know a guide would be a good thing to have. I don't even know how to access hyperdex or barterdex yet. Need to spend some time learning about them so I can get some deals on eqli

[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Its just in your whitepaper it says the total supply is 500 million however there is a block reward of 0.00010000. Will it be halving or is that block reward permanent?
