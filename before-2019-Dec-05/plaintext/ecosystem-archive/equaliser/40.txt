[dscrdeql] <shah1305> HI everyone

[07-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We try and ensure at least someone is always online and here, service and engagement is important. Ive noticed teams and devs hardly active in other discord servers but its often due to work and tasks needed to be done to grow and develop

[07-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anywhere that anyone in the community can help is always highly regarded and never goes unnoticed üòÉ

[07-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> hi @shah1305 keeping well?

[07-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> that sounds great

[07-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah need a strong community üòÉ

[07-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I've noticed in some discords, anyone of the team hardly talks, and in others multiple members of the team talk.

[07-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Strong community will make this grow for sure!

[07-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> And progress which we are working hard on üòÉ

[07-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <shah1305> Yes welsh slate i used

[07-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nothing like that on houses here, its all just cement tiles

[07-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <GROOT> Thx @AndronicusBass-Founder

[07-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <shah1305> tiles are ok but have a rough life of 10 to 15 years slate will go for 100 years

[07-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <GROOT> Wow nice goal by england

[07-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> As evidenced in many of the heritage buildings with slate that old or older

[07-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <shah1305> yes the slate on this house was original, house was built in 1890 it would have been a shame to use roof tiles
