[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I should of stayed in bed!

[03-Aug-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> The market is trashed

[03-Aug-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Maybe I‚Äôll wake up to something better lol

[03-Aug-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Or is it all a dream

[03-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Nope it‚Äôs reality

[03-Aug-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Market is a sea of red candles

[03-Aug-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Terrible

[03-Aug-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> All the hope of the last month is gone

[03-Aug-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The Time to buy is when there is blood running in the streets

[03-Aug-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> True that...I've got buy orders in

[03-Aug-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It'll pick up again

[03-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôll all work out fine in the end

[03-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> The longer the market stays down, the faster andr it'll go up....when it starts

[03-Aug-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Sucks that ppl are dumping but at least they are dumping in a down market, we will recover from this just fine.

[03-Aug-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes I think that's true

[03-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm putting money in based on that assumption

[03-Aug-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs one of those mind blowing things honestly I don‚Äôt understand anything about this.

[03-Aug-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> All we can do is wait out the markets and crank it up to an 11 when the timing is right

[03-Aug-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, I guess so

[03-Aug-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have a plan of action, plus I have some real world things working too

[03-Aug-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Great, that's very comforting too hear, cause I was freaking out a bit this morning

[03-Aug-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Buying in a falling market is not fun

[03-Aug-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah I‚Äôve been busy working on some stuff. Good thing about being low like this is that 1 btc could send everyone here 1000x and on a path for much greater gains

[03-Aug-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I try not to talk price but it kind of unavoidable in these market conditions

[03-Aug-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If no one publishes an article, looks like you won!

[03-Aug-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The age old saying to buy on a bear market sell on a bull.

[03-Aug-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Ehmjhay98> morning

[03-Aug-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto thanks

[03-Aug-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've created a steemit account but they said it can take a couple of weeks to activate...once it does I can also publish that article on there as well

[03-Aug-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> We need to get get the word out there as much as possible about EQL

[03-Aug-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Ehmjhay98 morning there

[03-Aug-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think I may have signed up a steemit  account last year. I will have to check.

[03-Aug-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Morning

[03-Aug-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have one

[03-Aug-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> Well hello folks.

[03-Aug-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> What's hanging with you all?

[03-Aug-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @SoldatChristi hi there

[03-Aug-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ‚òï  for you

[03-Aug-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> This crypto market is just red all over.

[03-Aug-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> üëå

[03-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> Waiting for Dec 2017 highs to come into effect üòÉ

[03-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, it's not too good at the moment

[03-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It will pick up again though

[03-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just need to hang in there

[03-Aug-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It is tough all over

[03-Aug-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> Yup.

[03-Aug-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> I've never hodled like I am hodling now.

[03-Aug-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> üòÉ

[03-Aug-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm kind of banking on a downtrend for a bit.

[03-Aug-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I can turn some serious profits from my business and buy a boatload of btc in the coming weeks

[03-Aug-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> I see BTC go up in value quickly too.

[03-Aug-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It can snap back at any second

[03-Aug-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> You bet.

[03-Aug-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But if it stays below 10k I‚Äôll be able to buy a decent amount in the coming weeks

[03-Aug-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> Lovely. I don't plan on putting anymore fiat into BTC, as I'm in the position of redeeming my rewards.

[03-Aug-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If I go get 5 cars at auction per week and turn those at 3k profit average, then in a month I‚Äôll be loaded with crazy amounts of bags then it doesn‚Äôt even matter about the markets for us as we will be building while markets do their thing

[03-Aug-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Plus I have several meetings in the coming weeks with land owners and some supply contacts

[03-Aug-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We are going to be just fine, it will just take us a bit longer than anticipated I feel

[03-Aug-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <yamakashy> good morning

[03-Aug-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto wow you're on the ball with all this...nice

[03-Aug-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
