[03-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> the same thing happened last month on the same day

[03-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> oh really, the buy wall on the same day in august?

[03-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> not the buy wall but the same type of pump

[03-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ah

[03-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> still thats interesting

[03-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> first day of the month buys are common in the equity markets

[03-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> wondering if some hedge funds are starting to employ the same strategies in crypto

[03-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> by using first of the month algos

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if the pattern continues another month my spidey senses will definitely be tingling
