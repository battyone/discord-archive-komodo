[14-Aug-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the dumper came along

[14-Aug-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and did his

[14-Aug-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> his handy work

[14-Aug-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> at halving the price of EQLI within seconds

[14-Aug-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> gone from an average of around 28 sats to 7 sats

[14-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> or 18 sat to 7 sats I should say

[14-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> good if you have your buy orders ready

[14-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> which I did...but unfortunatley just small buy orders

[14-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so rinse and repeat

[14-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> be good to know when the dumper will dump

[14-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> oh and how much he'll dump

[14-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the perfect recipe ..

[14-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ...when and how much

[14-Aug-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the key to making more EQLI

[14-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @jellysmash if it hit 7 then I guess my buy order of 11 hit...damn I bought high again, story of my life lol

[14-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <akomismo> How to generate an invite now?

[14-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so it hit 0.000000071 btc

[14-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> which is 7.1 sats

[14-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea. know how you feel because I had buy order at 10.8 and 9.1 sats

[14-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but this time the dumper dumped a lot more than usual

[14-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Wow. I bought in different orders from 16 to 11. Wish I started at 11.  You did a lot better than me

[14-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Oh well. Life goes on. I'll transfer to my wallet and wait.

[14-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @akomismo ...click the "Equaliser" dropdown in the top left hand side of screen in discord if you're on a computer...th

[14-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> there's an option there to "Invite People"

[14-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> click on that

[14-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <akomismo> Im using cp now

[14-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <akomismo> Theres no icon

[14-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Steve10 I was one of those idiots that bought at the very top at 46 sats

[14-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> also one of those lucky that bought at 1.8 sats

[14-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Lol you liked the extremes

[14-Aug-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> At least the 1.8 helps balance the 46

[14-Aug-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it was a moment of pure optimisim that the price was going to rocket and 46 sat still seemed very cheap

[14-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, one balances the other

[14-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Is anyone trying to trade these waves? Or just buying up the dumper's stuff and hodling

[14-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm doing both actually

[14-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> when I first started I was trading the waves

[14-Aug-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so got some good gains....but then I got emotionally attached and have been buying the dumps and hodling

[14-Aug-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> cause I think it's really going to go up a lot

[14-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't want to look back and kick myself for selling so cheap

[14-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> what about you?

[14-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> since the dump almost no trades have happened

[14-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe people are sitting back waiting to see what happens

[14-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ......or in shock
