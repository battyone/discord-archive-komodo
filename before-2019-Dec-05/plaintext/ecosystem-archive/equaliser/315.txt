[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yerba Mate is a south american tea that acts like coffee without caffeine. Thats if some arent allowed caffeine üëç

[15-Aug-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Trying to reduce coffee intake. Was doing 3-4 cups per day, plus energy drinks, plus tea, plus...

[15-Aug-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Energy drinks are nasty.

[15-Aug-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Some people find them addictive

[15-Aug-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> I have three jobs and was preparing loads of things for my wedding.

[15-Aug-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Was a matter of survival. üòâ

[15-Aug-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[15-Aug-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> that is stress and a half

[15-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Now that wedding is out of the way...more or less going cold turkey on the coffee and whatnot.

[15-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Just drinking water and jiaogulan tea.
