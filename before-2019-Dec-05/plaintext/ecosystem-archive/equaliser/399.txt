[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> then again, that isn't exactly an opinion  .. it's fact

[03-Sep-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Sep-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto good night

[03-Sep-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå yeah, it's all god until you mention Israel. . seems to happen alot in the crypto world

[03-Sep-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> *good

[03-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> The goal of equaliser is not to provide homes for everyone in the world...that wouldn't be practical...start out small in an area and then build it from there...so that in the future equaliser will be available to a large number of people's.

[03-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Oh those are my goals exactly jelly lol

[03-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have plans to build around the globe

[03-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But we can‚Äôt until we are sustained by a profitable business model.

[03-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> good. . . Syria is a good candidate

[03-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And as far as Israel goes I know nothing about what‚Äôs going on over there but for you to sit here and call US terrorists doesn‚Äôt sit well with me

[03-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I didn't call the US terrorists. .I said the US sponsored terrorists

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> you just said it yourself.. you know nothing of what's going on

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> but you're still mad at me

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> yawwn

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Oh ok well nevertheless just keep your thoughts to yourself man.

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> don't shoot the messenger

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> maybe you should catch up on world events

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Why even bother bringing it up here though  @MySoulisNotForSale

[03-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Even a messenger is responsible for the words that come out of his or her mouth

[03-Sep-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> but please avoid the lame stream news

[03-Sep-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's subjective based on opinions that have been read

[03-Sep-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm too busy doing my own work to worry about issues beyond my control

[03-Sep-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ohh crap . . one of my american friends is here. . I must go convert him

[03-Sep-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Equaliser is just starting out...try to build something...to help others get their own homes...why start bringing terrorists into that pure objective?

[03-Sep-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You‚Äôre gone man

[03-Sep-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> There's so many fires in the world...need to pick and choose those that can be extinguished

[03-Sep-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Don't ban him

[03-Sep-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think his head is in the right place

[03-Sep-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just needs to learn control and patience

[03-Sep-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's a maturity thing

[03-Sep-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Some young guys want to change evening...the whole world

[03-Sep-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You learn as you get older that you can't do everything

[03-Sep-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Gotta pick and choose where you can be most effective

[03-Sep-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Be practical

[03-Sep-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there.

[03-Sep-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no more worries of it

[03-Sep-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've warned him too many times.

[03-Sep-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Ok, fair enough

[03-Sep-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I know you've been patient

[03-Sep-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> negativity like that isn't necessary when nothing has prompted it

[03-Sep-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and I hate to even be that way.

[03-Sep-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Fair is fair when multiple warnings occur.

[03-Sep-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It also don't update pages properly unless you refresh on every change. Be damn careful there.

[03-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We have at least one other exchange in the works. More mainstream, hopefully less fuckery. Details are secret, because they have to be. But keep an eye out üòÑ

[03-Sep-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea I put an order through a few weeks back on the EQL/BTC books and it went on the EQL/ETH offer books and bought at the wrong rate...Gotta be very careful

[03-Sep-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But we need Exrates if we want to get listed on CMC

[03-Sep-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> We need to be on 2 exchanges listed on CMC....and Exrates is one of them

[03-Sep-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
