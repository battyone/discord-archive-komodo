[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> one of my fav shows no spoilers please

[28-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üòÇ

[28-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Alright, i put up 50k worth of different orders/coins. Hope they get triggered

[28-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Getting some real volume on there would be nice

[28-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> getting some real volume on exrates would be fabulous.

[28-Jul-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've pulled 50% of my orders on there to give it room to pump

[28-Jul-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> will it be work?

[28-Jul-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i would personally like to see us on another exchange there is too much negative reviews and comments regarding exrates it will scare people away

[28-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I get that totally, but I think (and hope) this update will help to improve on all of that.

[28-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Honestly i feel same way about barterdex. This is my first time using it and i have been a fan of KMD for a very long time

[28-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Digitalprice.io seems to be very KMD friendly - loads of the the KMD eco system on there facing  BTC and KMD

[28-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah barterdex put a dull spot on my shiny outlook of them but I have faith. this is chess not checkers.

[28-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah cowboy i hope so as well

[28-Jul-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> https://digitalprice.io worth checking out as alternative?

[28-Jul-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Looks similar to cryptopia's UI  @miles

[28-Jul-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Kinda low volume too

[28-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Yeah, tis indeed- think it just starting at the mo - the KMD market was day 1 today - found out About it from the chainzilla discord

[28-Jul-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, Y'all, update on the explorer.

[28-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Database got messed up. Some of you may have noticed that http://eql.explorer.dexstats.info/ was showing different info from the official block explorer. I have found the issue and it's being fixed. Technically has been fixed, but the daemons are being reindexed. dexstats has the correct info at the moment, and I will let y'all know as soon as the official explorer is back up to date. Meantime, just use http://eql.explorer.dexstats.info/
