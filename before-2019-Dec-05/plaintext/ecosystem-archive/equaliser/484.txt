[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Brings up a good question though....who is building the Equaliser Marketplace, or are we going to place it on another system to provide that functionality for Equaliser?

[17-Oct-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's probably a while away though before we need it.

[17-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Eh it’s closer than you think

[17-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will be reaching out for help but I think it can be done fairly easily

[17-Oct-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Tested a few market place applications over the months, keeping options open.

[17-Oct-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> Good night everyone!

[17-Oct-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Peace out ✌

[17-Oct-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice work guys on the EMP in the pipeworks

[17-Oct-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Or is that pipeline?

[17-Oct-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Lol

[17-Oct-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> either or. Ive actually heard both said before 🙂

[17-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> anyways, glad you guys are on the case

[17-Oct-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 👋

[17-Oct-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> How's the listing on raisex going.

[17-Oct-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's great that we'll have another exchange to trade on

[17-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Apparently their communication isn’t great so far, from what I know we do not have a time frame yet

[17-Oct-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> looking forward to a new exchange

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Oh well it'll happen eventually

[17-Oct-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m unsure. I’ve reached out a few times but haven’t heard back yet.  These things can take weeks (or even months)

[17-Oct-18 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If you want to buy, jump in and out on exrates

[17-Oct-18 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It helps us as well by driving price up

[17-Oct-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> I'm going to later this week

[17-Oct-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Heading home finally. Just got off phone with the engineer. Says we are the first aircrete block he’ll test lol. Glad he’s familiar with it though at least.

[17-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Awesome!

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But I don't want to eat deep fried foods

[18-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> too bad for the body

[18-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'll always try to choose an oven baked or grilled version

[18-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
