[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no idea about the reef to be honest

[11-Oct-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> heard it was getting better but then when my cousin visited aus from america she said when they went and seen it most looked dead

[11-Oct-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Oct-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If you live in Australia, look at splitting your fiat deposits or getting deposits out of the banks. I have been following the whole "bail-in" concept for a few years and these guys confirmed what i found out myself https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2PI2lEBwY

[11-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The barrier reef is being bleached and I think its from leaking radiation from fukushima possibly which also explains all the dead sea life washing up on shore throughout the last half decade

[11-Oct-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> has plausibility

[11-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Everything bubble. good thing crypto had the correction this year as it is healthy.

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> my opinion and others may see differently. 2018 hurt badly but when bank bail-in's happen and stocks crash and cash rates have to rise eventually. there will be no where to go besides owning property outright or crypto or precious metals

[11-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> cash will seem like the go because if cash rates rise, and they have to if looking at economics 101 when so much leverage in the world, problem is bank deposits can be used to bail in banks, will be a trap

[11-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> we are working so damn hard on getting building going

[11-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> corrections are healthy in cycles, when stocks keep climbing and debt keeps rising without intervention, the longer it goes the harder the correction or other wise known as deleveraging

[11-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but for short term safety people will likely migrate to cash. 
when bitcoin breaks $6000 people arent going to sell BTC to buy alts...they will sell BTC and put in cash equivalent.
same for other assets like stocks and bonds. until the dust settles and global economic volatility subsides a bit i think a migration to cash will be the safe haven people have been neglecting for the past decade as they went from investing in one asset to another. thats my opinion.
when bitcoin gets to the low $3,000's i will be interested in buying again. until then, or a miraculous recovery back over $8,000...im out

[11-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i thought 2016 was gonna be it but corporate tax breaks kept the party going and it was only a flash crash. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2PI2lEBwY
If you're in australia and NZ, possibly U.K and U.S.A as the g20 all signed in bain-in provisions as opposed to bail-ou provisions they used tax payer money in 2008 to bail out banks. cash deposits cxan be confiscated as happened in cypress. 
Cash will seem enticing especially if interest rates rise to deleverage excessive credit in the system and broad money supply, the trap is depositing fiat into banks and it will be used to bail-in. Australian banks only have to give notice the same day they do it by word of a news paper ad and it could already happen before you know.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've noticed the sentiment around crypto from previous proponents with large followings has subsided at the moment. Best thing is to research alot and look at the technology and use cases of everything and decide for yourself. I had a discussion with some ex work colleagues a few years ago (all women) and they said probably in a post apocalyptic world or major depression, women will still want cosmetics so if there's any crypto around ccosmetics, could be another diversification avenue lol üòÇ  Crypto's to do with Human necessity and renewable energy, shelter, water, food etc

[11-Oct-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
