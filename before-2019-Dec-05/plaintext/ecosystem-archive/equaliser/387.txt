[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m gonna be hit and miss for a bit as we are getting into the physical end of things. Saw we jumped up some on exrates, which is progress, so thank you all for that. If you all could, please start spreading the word to your favorite influencers on YouTube, twitter and Facebook regarding Equalizer. It will take an army but I believe that we can change the world.

[30-Aug-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I have a suggestion

[30-Aug-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> John Macafee

[30-Aug-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> He's a busy man 🙂

[30-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> John isn’t touching anything for under 100k

[30-Aug-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[30-Aug-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I know John and honestly don’t want to deal with him.

[30-Aug-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> ah nice i see some activity on exrates

[30-Aug-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> 200% increase not bad aye?

[30-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Definitely a step in the right direction

[30-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> 👍🏼

[30-Aug-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> i hate to say this but exrate is a really shit exchange

[30-Aug-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> i mean what the hell and how the hell would a noob read high: 8e-8 open: 2.1e-7 what is this 😆

[30-Aug-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I get the frustration, but it’s what we have currently. I think with the next rally we will gain more exchanges and get a lot of traction

[30-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If I want to buy more I would just putt a low buy order in instead of buying now

[30-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But don't get to greedy because I've had it happen to me that I missed out on some coins

[30-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wow, wow, am I seeing a buy order at 17 sats? 😮

[30-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
