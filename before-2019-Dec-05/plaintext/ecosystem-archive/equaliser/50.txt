[08-Jul-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i have not used a decentralized exchange yet

[08-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> once its setup properly you just have to login and click exchange. slight learning curve but worth it over all, funds are secure with you and not on an exchange susceptible to hacking and frozen funds

[08-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> haha thanks @Thorth

[08-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> FYI, I replied to a comment someone made which basically outlines my basic view on Australian economy and most other developed countries. 😃 - Good points. I do believe this production intends to explain the current situation to those with zero to minimal economic understanding. However, I think the basic understanding of money flow/velocity is important in regards to household spending what I've come to understand, when money printing is going on and you have low cash rate/interest rates, the desire to spend with credit is irresistible however, when it goes on too long, it just can not be sustained. People will need to tighten the belt, stop spending and money flow dries up/ velocity slows down and If money printing doesn't slow we can get runaway inflation or hyperinflation otherwise the cash rate will need to be increased and the ramifications of that is higher credit interest rates which will also lead to having to tighten the belt and stop spending, its a catch 22. Australia is at 190% household debt to income and eventually interest rates have to be increased otherwise confidence in the monetary system will diminish. I truly think we are going to have to have a correction or deleveraging, weather it's a smooth one or rapid one is to be seen. I think that is the important focus for now is controlling the correction but I do like your Idea in your last sentence. 😃

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i believe in crypto, that comment was just my economic hat on with objective view 😃
