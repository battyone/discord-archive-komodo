[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> someone just put in an oarder for 340,000 eql at 0.0000001 btc

[21-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah i see it

[21-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they are trying to rack up a ton of em, i dont blame them one bit

[21-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> is it you?  ^^ ?

[21-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> as soon as i know the money is free flowing, I will do my thing on there

[21-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what do you mean free flowing

[21-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> deposits/withdraws work fine

[21-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> free flowing

[21-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> wasn't the price of eql around 26 cents just a couple days ago?

[21-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> it's still showing at 36 cents on barterdex

[21-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> 30 I mean

[21-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yes that is why none of this makes sense at all

[21-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> is it still being traded on bartardex?

[21-Jul-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Tonight will be my 1st attempt at bDEX...want to see what it is all about

[21-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Good luck

[21-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Although hyper is easier @NWhiskeyTango

[21-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Barterdex best keep in mind your utxos

[21-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> The auto utxo splitter is better in hyperdex

[21-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Or at least it feels like that

[21-Jul-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> In barterdex I just manually make an inventory

[21-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Should you have questions visit the #tradebots or #hyperdex channel on komodo discord

[21-Jul-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> BDEX can be frustrating

[21-Jul-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> on it now

[21-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
