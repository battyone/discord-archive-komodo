[25-Nov-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Cool, sounds like a good plan

[25-Nov-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You're a work machine

[25-Nov-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Good planning, good working

[25-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Be great if everyone can send some tweets out

[25-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Let everyone know Equaliser is killing it

[25-Nov-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe all the rain dumpers have gone through all their EQLI.  now they'll be super pissed when equaliser rises as the phoenix from the ashes.  Nice one Equaliser

[25-Nov-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> What happened with the 600k EQLI order? üòÆ

[25-Nov-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Would be awsome if he's out of EQLI to sell üòÇ

[25-Nov-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i would guess the guy got smart. realized some big things are happening and price will be much higher very soon

[25-Nov-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe they finally saw common sense and removed it

[25-Nov-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just a few small orders left under 100sats and its off ot the races

[25-Nov-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Good day everyone

[25-Nov-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think that the disable of rain will be a good thing in the end

[25-Nov-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If this is all the EQLI on sale then it's not hard to go up

[25-Nov-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> when you thin kabout who holds this coin...the 3 founders hold the bulk...admin and moderators and helpers prob hold a bunch...then some other random rain holders and thats prob it.

[25-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so if a few people get interested in this project and all the good news thats coming out then it will take off

[25-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Howdy folks - yup I agree @SwimedDragon , for now the rain will weed out the ppl that just randomly show up for rain

[25-Nov-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Exactly

[25-Nov-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Nice going .

[25-Nov-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Gaining traction is always good

[25-Nov-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I know who‚Äôs holding what for the most part

[25-Nov-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Most of our sales were done otc by myself and bio

[25-Nov-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yea you def know most of my holdings like 80% of them üòÇ

[26-Nov-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hope everyone is keeping well in these dark market times. Remember, those that criticise something don't know anything about it and some wish they knew about it before everyone else did üòÅ

[26-Nov-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> true that...no point listening to criticisers

This market is not a catastrophe, it is an opportunity. In this process of planning I highly recommend picking up some $EQLI, part of the @KomodoPlatform ecosystem. They are on https://t.co/Uj1xx0H5rG - Homes built from blockchain. @OfficialEQL $KMD

[26-Nov-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> great tweet

[26-Nov-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> totally agree

[26-Nov-18 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Thanks man, now we need an effective way to expand outside of Twitter

[26-Nov-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, not sure how to do that though.

[26-Nov-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Facebook and Instagram are what come to mind off the top of my head

[26-Nov-18 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm not much of a facebook person

[26-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think the  bounty was good in getting people to get the word out there across all channels. But I think as a community it's up to us to promote Equaliser as much as we can. We shouldn't need a bounty in order to send a couple of tweets out each week or facebook/insta posts. doesn't take much time to send some tweets.

[26-Nov-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think if we can create an equaliser business page on facebook and link it to an instagram business page so a post on one site automatically goes to the other site would be useful

[26-Nov-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> People and companies that don't benefit from crypto and blockchain including the media they own and run will always bash crypto and blockchain. Broader society when they wake up to the atrocities and manipulation of the current monetary system when it crashes will invest into anything that isn't stocks, bonds or forex

[26-Nov-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> anyone get an email from exrates? invest 1 btc and you will get 1.5 btc back in 25 days lol

[26-Nov-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> "Minimal investment is 0.01 BTC, and Maximum is 10 BTC."

[26-Nov-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they probably won't understand it becasue it's not in russian

[26-Nov-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> just got another email from exrates saying to ignore the first email

[26-Nov-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> "Exrates exchange does collect any investment charges at the moment.
Please ignore emails with the  "Your investment opportunity - JUST TODAY!" subject and do not respond to such provocative emails from non-official accounts!"

[26-Nov-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[26-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so I have no idea what they're doing. ....looks like someone is phishing and sending bogus emails on their behalf.  lol
