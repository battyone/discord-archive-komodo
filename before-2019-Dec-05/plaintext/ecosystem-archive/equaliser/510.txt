[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Would it be good to add a little more info on the rewards contract in a follow up tweet so people know what it is and how it works?

[16-Nov-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Happy Friday morning from cold Canada üá®üá¶- 15 here today.

[16-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Or can I post a link to the medium article chapter 2 if that still holds the rewards and timeframes for the different contracts?

[16-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> its really sad how some idiot showed 464,120 EQLI all in one order. talk about stoooopid!

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I was very upset last night as I expevted the line to hold better and i was crazy tired.

[16-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But I slept like 11 hours last night, Im crazy rested and say let them sell. Im pouring blocks as I do everyday, stacking the ones that cured the night before. Nothing will stop this team from doing what we set out to do. Nothing.

[16-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
