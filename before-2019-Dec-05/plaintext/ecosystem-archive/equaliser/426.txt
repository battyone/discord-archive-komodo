[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Company stock buybacks are unsustainable and the company tax breaks last year allowed more companies to buy back their stocks. similar levels of stock buybacks happened before the GFC

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> How's it going guys

[14-Sep-18 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Morning  @akomismo

[14-Sep-18 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm at work at the moment

[14-Sep-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @AndronicusBass do you think if stock market plummets that a lot of that money will follow into crypto, or fiat?

[14-Sep-18 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe people will feel inclined to put it in the bank however, what was learned from cypress is that people savings were locked up and limited access, some took a loss. the G20 signed a bail-in agreement as opposed to a bail-out agreement, the difference being that bail-out is when the government uses tax payer funds but a bail-in is where creditors bail out the bank. when you have savings in a bank, you are a creditor

[14-Sep-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> If funds get locked in the bank, then wouldn't funds be safer in crypto?

[14-Sep-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> so I think those that are in the know will stay away from fiat, stocks, bonds. they may very well pile into crypto, gold, silver and property. Equaliser, we cover the crypto and property bases üòÉ additionally, property that is in bubble territory will not be bought for diversifying portfolios. Undervalued and affordable poroperty will I believe

[14-Sep-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> @AndronicusBass-Founder so you are thinking bear stock markets will cause a bull crypto market?

[14-Sep-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Logic points to yes in my view

[14-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> But I think logically anyway  üòÅ

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe diversification is key

[14-Sep-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Sep-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Sep-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Sep-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, it's really encouraging for new people coming in to Equaliser, to see such a vibrant community, and good price

[14-Sep-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The entire crypto community across discord is less active than the first half of the year I have noticed. I think many weak hands.

[14-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe cause of the huge down trend in general across all crypto

[14-Sep-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> At least crypto seemed to have a good day today

[14-Sep-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, not too bad

[14-Sep-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Bo> It's still the same everywhere with banks. Nothing has changed.
In the Netherlands very recently a bank has been under discussion for helping with large scale money laundering
One of the leaders was "sacrificed" and left with a large bonus üòÉ (after money laundering..)

[14-Sep-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> No "gov" wants to be in power when a collapse occurs from negligent policies so more negligent policies kick the can to delay. Those that didn't want a bank RC knew loans are another form of QE. Aus people need a revolution.

[14-Sep-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, not much trust with banks

[14-Sep-18 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yet the MSM is owned by the owners of the banks so the FUD and propaganda against blockchain is abhorrent

[14-Sep-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> True

[14-Sep-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I work for a company that is an ADI Australian deposit-taking institution, that provides payment systems and gateways for eftpos and visa. They've decreed at the board level that the company will not have anything to do with crypto.

[14-Sep-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Sep-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Sep-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, they'll be all for crypto eventually, but probably when it's too late.
