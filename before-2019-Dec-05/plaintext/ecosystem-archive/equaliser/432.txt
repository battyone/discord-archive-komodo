[15-Sep-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there anything out on %rewards for a masternode?

[15-Sep-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It won’t be like traditional masternode

[15-Sep-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will but it won’t

[15-Sep-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will be done through crypto conditioned contracts

[15-Sep-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> CCC

[15-Sep-18 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m thinking multiple tiers of nodes dependent on length of contract

[15-Sep-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Huum sounds promising 😃

[15-Sep-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol you guys have no clue what is coming

[15-Sep-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hope I make you all millionaires seriously.

[15-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't want to be filthy rich, I just want to give my son everything I could not get when I was younger. But let's be honest, besides some important things in life, having some big extra dollars won't hurt haha

[15-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Those words are priceless @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[15-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I already said and you know it I trust you 100% and more so I can’t wait for what’s going to happen in the future

[15-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I look forward to it very much

[15-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I don’t mind being filthy rich haha, just don’t let your kids get spoiled

[15-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if i do ever get filthy rich i hope i don't change and end up using most of that to help others

[15-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> 🤞

[15-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> alright people good night have a good day guys and keep holding

[15-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[15-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @CombatWombat good night

[15-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @Podmaster I probably wouldn't be any happier if I was filthy rich

[15-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Makes things easier that's all

[15-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Wouldn't have to go top work

[15-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think it also depends on what you've got to spend each month

[15-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Some people earn enough to do whatever they want with their family, eat where ever they are.

[15-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I you'd need top find a worthwhile project to feel like your life had meaning

[15-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I you'd need top find a worthwhile project to feel like your life had meaning

[15-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not saying I have it that bad, but if I take my son somewhere, we can't order meals or snacks or stay somewhere and have dinner there. We alway's take some cheap drinks and something to eat when we go

[15-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's alway's hard to say no when all the other kids get a bag of chips

[15-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think it's just luxery stuff

[15-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, that's true.we can't go where we want as a family cause it's too expensive

[15-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Because in the end, we got something to drink and eat

[15-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I want to go on a family vacation for as long as I remember

[15-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I take all our food so we don't have to buy it cause it's too expensive to eat out

[15-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Only when I was a little kid (6) we sort of had our whole family going somewhere. But that was it

[15-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, it's expensive 😦 I do like to eat in a restaurant because I alway's try out different dishes, but it's mostly once a month thing

[15-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> When we go on holidays I have to book 2 hotel rooms cause there's 6 of us, so I book cheap hotels

[15-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But we've still been on a lot of holidays together as a family

[15-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I just try to do it cheap

[15-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> We've also been overseas a bit as well as a family which has been great

[15-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Those kind of holiday's are already too expensive for us here 😦

[15-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> My wife worked for an airline so we get cheap flights

[15-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe I should get a wife like that haha

[15-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Still get them as part of her redundancy

[15-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> She stopped working there but still get the flight benefits

[15-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> thats amazing

[15-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 😄

[15-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, good deal

[15-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I just hate how greedy some of my family members are 😦 I still love them and want to go on holiday with everyone. But I mean, one or two of my uncles could easely pay for everyone if they want to, but they don't

[15-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And my mother in law alway's goes on vacation trips. Going to a camping site every weekend, and has like 5 expensive vacations to other countries.

[15-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe it's just me, I really hate how some family members don't share, but all I care is that I want to pay for everyone if I would have that money to do so

[15-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep you would share what you have in orders thats because you have a god heart some others are greedier as you said and want all of the money for themself

[15-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> themselves*

[15-Sep-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But who knows, anything can happen 😃

[15-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe things change over the coming years

[15-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Sep-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm thinking of lighting a fire later

[16-Sep-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'll have to check if I can since there was a fire ban yeterday

[16-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think due to the strong wind and higher temperatures

[16-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I have a firepit...I'm not talking of a bush fire

[16-Sep-18 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
