[31-Jul-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for thos of u that care about technicals.....

this is a chart of BTC from the dec 2017 highs. for the first time since, the break over the bearish trendline (red dashed line) which also coincided with the 50day mov avg, is very encouraging. now price over its 100day with the 200day up near 9300.
a  healthy retracement is 38% (wikipedia Fibonacci if you dont already know) which is up near $11,115.
so technically as long as BTC can hld its 50day then that 11,115 area is the target. unfortunately, if it breaks the recent lows near $6k we are looking at a print in the low $3k's.

[31-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> regardless of ta ive always said below 6k no good

[31-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> when we dipped last time it wasn't long and we bounced back.. if we break 6k i think btc crashing hard and taking most the market with it
