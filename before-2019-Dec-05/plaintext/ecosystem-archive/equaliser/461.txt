[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My coins are missing as well, so I honestly do not want to take a chance

[22-Sep-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Vinsmokeüåπüç§> They might not recover from that right?

[22-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im not sure honestly.

[22-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> Withdrawal is not available right now üòÆ

[22-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I dont know what is going on

[22-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> good

[22-Sep-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that means they are working on it

[22-Sep-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hate this exchange..

[22-Sep-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> my balance is showing though

[22-Sep-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yours is?

[22-Sep-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> because mine is missing in action

[22-Sep-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> yeah, mine is intact.

[22-Sep-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> just can't withdraw

[22-Sep-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> good deal.

[22-Sep-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that makes me happy at least, but worries me at the same time.

[22-Sep-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think I had like a lil over half a million or so on there,

[22-Sep-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and it would explain the dumping that happened.

[22-Sep-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> I have a lot more than that üòÑ

[22-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> I just hope that It is nothing serious

[22-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> 1/3 of my holding

[22-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> how long since you guys realized the issue?

[22-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just noticed as I was notified by Combat Wombat

[22-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> apparently Jelly got hit as well

[22-Sep-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> no email about new IP address login?

[22-Sep-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> about half mil sold in the market, it might be yours

[22-Sep-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> It seems that they disabled the withdrawal for BTC as well

[22-Sep-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Good Morning

[22-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Nope my email security seems fine

[22-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> No suspicious activity

[22-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> But I changed my password just to be sure

[22-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Hang in there people we will get past this

[22-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> This very serious and bad on part of Exrates

[22-Sep-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> I wanted to withdraw btc off exrates it took forever. I had to cancel then buy EQLI before I was able to withdraw. I am glad I withdraw my EQL

[22-Sep-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> digitalprice.io is not too bad of an exchange

[22-Sep-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no volume at all on there though lol

[22-Sep-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need your email addresses if you are missing coins

[22-Sep-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I am talking with them directly.

[22-Sep-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> it's safer than exrates üòÑ

[22-Sep-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> true enough lol

[22-Sep-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> here I need your email addresses for exrates if youa re missing coins

[22-Sep-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> So they replied to your messages? that's great

[22-Sep-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Take it easy @‚úåJellysmash‚úå  as long as @CowboyCrypto- Founder  is talking to them hopefully it will workout

[22-Sep-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, I've just DM him

[22-Sep-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hopefully he can put some pressure on them to do something about it

[22-Sep-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Well at least I know my accounts are safe I really got worried and thought maybe I did get hacked

[22-Sep-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> So lucky it's just an ex rates issueb

[22-Sep-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Still sucks

[22-Sep-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Vinsmokeüåπüç§> That btc is the saddest one. How many btc exactly r we talking about whove gone missing?

[22-Sep-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No worries I will figure it out.

[22-Sep-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> wont go to sleep til I do

[22-Sep-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Morning all - very sorry to read the news about what is going on. Hope you can get it sorted @CowboyCrypto- Founder and thanks for being so 100% open with what is going on. I had a small buy that hit overnight and balance is showing, but like Gordon, can‚Äôt withdraw. @‚úåJellysmash‚úå you might want to delete that email from public channel

[22-Sep-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> My purchase orders went through as well and it looks like my balance is still intact. Hope everything gets figured out

[22-Sep-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will

[22-Sep-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> just will take some time

[22-Sep-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> tomorrow will be a long day lol

[22-Sep-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That‚Äôs quite a big issue, did they know/figure out what happened?

[22-Sep-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they are investigating.

[22-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they didnt try to sell mine.

[22-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they just tried to send it to a wallet.

[22-Sep-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> being open and honest is kind of a big deal when you are trying to build something meaningful.

[22-Sep-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if i were being secretive about this then it would become a bigger deal when it was discovered and seen that we hadnt addressed it.

[22-Sep-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Well I am glad you guys talked me into withdrawing my lions share of EQLI. I am gonna try to get back to sleep. Saw the message and had to log on to check

[22-Sep-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Zach your lucky.Nice

[22-Sep-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[22-Sep-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Damn, I've seen the exrates announcement. I hope everything is going to be fine.

[22-Sep-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm glad I moved most of my coins to my wallet, I only have about 7k on exrates. Is it safe to login on their website?

[22-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[22-Sep-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Dang, why did only EQLI holders get hacked?

[22-Sep-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @SwimedDragon if I hold that 6 satoshis and btc goes to 1 million dollars i might be able to buy a cheeseburger üòõ

[22-Sep-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no idea Zach... this entire thing stinks

[22-Sep-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm glad I'm probably only lost about 8k, got the rest in the Agama wallet

[22-Sep-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Did you guy's lost all or had some in the Agama wallet too?
