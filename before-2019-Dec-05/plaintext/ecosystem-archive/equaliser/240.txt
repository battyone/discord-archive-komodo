[31-Jul-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can take very little credit for the fix. I get an E for effort, but ultimately it was Siu at Chainmakers that found the fix üòÑ Buy that man a beer!

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Also the fix don't work for Komodo ocean. So y'all using that need to use agama for now. Decker and the other Komodo ocean people have been informed.

[31-Jul-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Or if you're comfortable with the command line you can use Komodod directly.
