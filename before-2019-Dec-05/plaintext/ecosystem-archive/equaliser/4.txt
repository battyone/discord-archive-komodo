[04-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I was almost thinking of doing a gif but realised what chat room I was in lol old habits dying hard

[04-Jul-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> Haha. No gifs in here I read

[04-Jul-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> ðŸ˜¬

[04-Jul-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, this chat is easier to read now, I'm really glad the gifs are in a different room now

[04-Jul-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, we thought people would appreciate it. We will have more people joining over time and we like to keep general channel professional out of respect. I will probably spend most of my time in #gif-ted but I have to make sure that xp is still being accumulated when chatting there too

[04-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Aspire219> general is only channel to increase xp?

[04-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Yukitty is a 50 years old guy> @skyfyre yes need to talk

[04-Jul-18 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I will double check which channels, I think its just that chatting in tipsy rain doesn't give xp

[04-Jul-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> except when raining. the reason is that rain pushes comments to history quickly and its difficult to go back and read them

[04-Jul-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> @Yukitty is a 50 years old guy hey friend

[04-Jul-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> The nuts had an effect

[04-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> the horse read the dictionary but nibbled that instead

[04-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> A mare talked into the bar

[04-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> But was below his bar..

[04-Jul-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> so the bar had to be raised

[04-Jul-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> So..

[04-Jul-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> They decided

[04-Jul-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> To close the bar

[04-Jul-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
