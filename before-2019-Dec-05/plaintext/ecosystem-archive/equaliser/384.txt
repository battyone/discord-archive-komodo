[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yep

[29-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> thanks üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> as long as you've kept your seed then you can import that see into any wallet.

[29-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so no worries if the agama wallet is uninstalled, you just need to open the newly installed wallet using the same seed key

[29-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I couldn't update my wallet, maybe I already had that version, is that possible?

[29-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> important update from komodo ^

[29-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I already seem to have 0.2.41 beta for a while

[29-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I tried to install the new one but it didn't offer any reinstall option

[29-Aug-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm not sure how I can change from this if this is the wrong one. I'm afraid I update it wrong if I just press it

[29-Aug-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> it's 41d

[29-Aug-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> v0.2.41d

[29-Aug-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there any reason why it doesn't state that I can re-install it or something like that?

[29-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I need to eat so I gonna try figure it out later

[29-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if i remember correctly it automatically uninstalls the prev version first

[29-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> then installs the new version

[29-Aug-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you can maybe go into your downloads folder and see which version you last downloaded

[29-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think I had an older one, I'll try to install again and see what happens

[29-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> üëç

[29-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, I was afraid to do something wrong if I continued, but the re-install option was 1 click further it seems üòÇ

[29-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But thanks üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sure no problem

[29-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> as long as you have your keys/seed youre safe

[29-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you can even use the same keys on barterdex to see your wallet holdings

[29-Aug-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> sorry i was on phone call

[29-Aug-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> true what c2k says

[29-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Looks like it updated correctly, thanks üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> on here

[29-Aug-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you use the Agama wallet?

[29-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> tipsy wont let him withdraw

[29-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> gonna have to speak to tipsy dev

[29-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Have you checked the right order?

[29-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I meant more like ?withdraw, then adress, and then the amount

[29-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Some other discord bots want you to putt the amount first and then adress, maybe that got mixed up?

[29-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> yes, I tried to paste it here, but the bot won't let me üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I can make a screenshot

[29-Aug-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> thx

[29-Aug-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What level are you. I think you cant withdraw under level 5

[29-Aug-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> He's level 9 I think

[29-Aug-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> np

[29-Aug-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Was the first thing I've checked

[29-Aug-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> nice

[29-Aug-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @Bo Did you try to type ?withdraw, then your adress you want to withdraw to, and then the amount of EQLI?

[29-Aug-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> yes

[29-Aug-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I withdrew well before

[29-Aug-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> the same way

[29-Aug-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are you withdrawing to an Agama wallet?

[29-Aug-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If yes, did you install the newest version? Not sure if that causes it if you haven't, but you can alway's try to update it

[29-Aug-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> yes, yes üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> close discord and reopen.

[29-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hopefully that helps

[29-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I tried yesterday, so I don't think that is the problem

[29-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I can't send a screenshot here?

[29-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> paste it in support

[29-Aug-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
