[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> If England win the World Cup we won't have a rest. Premier League commentary will be like:
"World Cup winner Jordan Henderson wins the tackle"

"Eric Dier who won the World Cup passes the ball forward"

"Young World cup winner Rashford makes a run behind the defense"

Sterling the star in Russia during England world cup triumph is warming up.
Pickford, one spot kick stopper in the just ended world cup winning campaign warms up for the game
Kane the sir in the world cup winning team wipes a sweat from his face
Dele the talented world cup winner takes a throw in

We can't stand this commentary

[07-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> haha, commentary that explains everything. "Player substituted because he needs the toilet"
