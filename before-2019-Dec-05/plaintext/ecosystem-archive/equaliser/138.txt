[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> What is liquidity

[21-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The ability to move money quickly.

[21-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs basically back end financing

[21-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That allows exchanges to shift money fast

[21-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
