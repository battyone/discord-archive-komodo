[09-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Hi  @donaldmathers

[09-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> What‚Äôs up

[09-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> haha

[09-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Haha for now nope

[09-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> be safe.....

[09-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> With the traffic, the drive took closer to 3 hrs

[09-Jul-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i dont miss traffic, i havent driven for about 6 years

[09-Jul-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> public transport works well for me and 1 less car off the road

[09-Jul-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> of course not everyone has the choice to go without a car and is a necessity particularly for people that have to live further away from cities in regional areas because rent and property prices are cheaper

[09-Jul-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Exactly

[09-Jul-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I hate it sometimes

[09-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Oh well

[09-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> How ya doing @AndronicusBass-Founder

[09-Jul-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I‚Äôm tired

[09-Jul-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Too tired lol

[09-Jul-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We are all slaves to the system some way or another. In order for cheaper housing we must sacrifice time by commuting to work longer distances or be jam packed into a sardine tin of trains and busses. Quality of living has really hit the skids, let alone the increase of people that are falling below the poverty line. All this in 2018, the 21st century.

[09-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I hear that

[09-Jul-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Rain!

[09-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @donaldmathers I haven't really asked the community opinion however, what's your favourite 2 things about Equaliser?

[09-Jul-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> So far-I havent looked too much into it but one thing I like is how helpful and transparent you all are. Being able to buy a house with eql is amazing too

[09-Jul-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> So the rain isnt one? lol

[09-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> But of course!

[09-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I have been refining our mission statement to clearly get it across. tell me what you think?

[09-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Equaliser is a Blockchain based solution that aims to provide affordable, strong, energy efficient and beautiful homes and accommodation which will contain a title registry and proof of ownership functionality. It is a utility coin with its own notarised, asset blockchain on the Komodo platform. 

Equaliser built homes and accommodation will utilise economical and new construction techniques and designs with the long-term goal of reducing and eventually, help to eliminate the barriers to entry level home ownership for struggling, low income households throughout the globe with a portion of profits going towards helping people in need. 

Equaliser will provide access to a great store of value in real estate however, buying Equaliser gives no one claims or rights to property however, rather the opportunity to purchase property we build paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value. Equaliser won't contribute to already rising established property prices as we are our own separate market.

[09-Jul-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> what exchanges will EQLI list on?

[09-Jul-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We cant announce before it happens, exchanges have NDA's

[09-Jul-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Are there requirements for these homes

[09-Jul-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> To be purchased in EQLI

[09-Jul-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Like for example only families that make less than 20-30k a year

[09-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Or other requirements

[09-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> means that they can buy say 1000000 EQL and use that to trade to get a new house?

[09-Jul-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> is that right

[09-Jul-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I think that's what it means from the mission statement

[09-Jul-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We will look at refining our strategies and funtionalities as we grow. However when it comes to assistance for people in need, it will generally be from natural disasters and we will define other ways of assistance as we expand

[09-Jul-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> what countries are you looking at providing housing for?

[09-Jul-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> That‚Äôs awesome

[09-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sourge> morning

[09-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We are starting in Puerto Rico because when we build, the techniques and designs are made to be hurricane resistant, and the local jobs we want  to help create goes to helping communities and local economy when we use local suppliers and materials. this model will be perfected and then used when we move into other markets in other countries

[09-Jul-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> People all around the world need to know about this

[09-Jul-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> this monolithic dome you can see the damage of the render but the structural integrity has not diminished whatsoever

[09-Jul-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> That‚Äôs what you‚Äôll be building?

[09-Jul-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I like them

[09-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> of course doors and windows will be reinforced in hurricane prone locations, like when we begin building in the U.S tornado alley it will be practical

[09-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> how old is it?

[09-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> what's it made out of...concrete?

[09-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> it's the perfect design and shape for a hurricane area
