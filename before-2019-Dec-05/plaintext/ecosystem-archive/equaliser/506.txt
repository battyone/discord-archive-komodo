[13-Nov-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> it has no volume really i think

[13-Nov-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> kmd has an special exchange for itself ?

[13-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> hyperdex

[13-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Stex doesn't have the volume of say bittrex, but it has good volume for what we need to do and that is true volume as well.

[13-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Awsome to see that Cowboy ðŸ˜„

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> crex also can be considred

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And the ticker is also good ðŸ˜„

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Eh I asked some people about crex and decided against it.

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> stex has decent volume for sure

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i love crex

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> @CowboyCrypto- Founder why ?

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need to go where my marketers are comfortable sending people

[13-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> its like stex

[13-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah crex is not bad

[13-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> cryptopia also is good

[13-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm using it recently, no problems encountered so far

[13-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I ran into that problem wiht exrates so now we are behind on money and on delivery, we need to go where our marketing support is comfortable sending people to buy.

[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> cryptopia is crazy expensize lol

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> cryptopia is great, but do you have 10 btc to list?

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> exrates and yobit are russian i think

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Exrates is turkish.

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> yobit is a scam

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> they dont have support , if you need support there will be no answer

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and they cant keep people staffed

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> sistemkoin.com is also turkish and good vol

[13-Nov-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have had 7 account managers so far since our listing with exrates.

[13-Nov-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think it depends on what prices you buy their coin at for the listing at cryptopia, maybe it can be cheaper if you can accumulate enough of those coins. I do not know about other people's experience with crex, but so far mine has been good. I've done deposits and withdraws, but on some coins they seem to lack volume on some coins compared to cryptopia or cryptobridge (assuming they're listed on all of those), so I wouldn't say to pay much for a crex listing

[13-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> they are still fairly new is why volume is still low on some coins. but i think they are doing a great job there

[13-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> loads up a lot faster than it used to now

[13-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> integrated faucets

[13-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> bargain

[13-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> never had problems with deposits or withdrawals there

[13-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> market is not good and can bargain

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> lol

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you could buy dot at the current price each it would take about 8 btc to be listed on cryptopia

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you pay with that dot I think

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not sure how that will go

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> you have to pay with dot

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> 8btc is high

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> 7.99 is fair

[13-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Dot is 201 sats now, last time we spoke about it it was about 121 sats each ðŸ˜‚

[13-Nov-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> .3 I think crex

[13-Nov-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> @SwimedDragon they have spy in this room

[13-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> What did people say about crex to you? @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I cant exactly discuss details of listings

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> sorry

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there are clauses in the contracts even when negotiating.

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So no word can be spoken about the negotiatings?

[13-Nov-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Even if they end up to no deal?
