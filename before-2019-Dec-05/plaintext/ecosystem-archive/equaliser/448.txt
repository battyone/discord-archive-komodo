[dscrdeql] <Zach> My wife has been pushing me to work out a bunch more lately, I know it’s good for me but I don’t wanna do it

[19-Sep-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's good you have someone to push you to get motivated, embrace that

[19-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah i need to change certain parts of my life style

[19-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> wish i had some one pushing me to get motivated

[19-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Sometimes I wish I didn’t have someone pushing me 😂

[19-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but i've stopped stuff before so i can get that motivation back just gotta find it lol

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> where are you motivation??? come to wombat

[19-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I wonder if there is a blockchain reward system for getting motivated or quitting smoking at least?

[19-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> that would be cool

[19-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Hello guys sounds like you have a plan already to stop smoking 😂

[19-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I’m gonna start smoking in order to get rewarded for quitting

[19-Sep-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> @Buddz1993 you want to contribute to him stopping smoking or you want to stop smoking?

[19-Sep-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Like you said smoking can be quite expensive

[19-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah more expensive in some places

[19-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> where are you from? how much is a pack there

[19-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nevermind💕> Hello

[19-Sep-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I wanna say in the states it ranges from $6-$14 depending on where you are

[19-Sep-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Also depends on the brand

[19-Sep-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yep

[19-Sep-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Wish we could get it for that price

[19-Sep-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> That a 20 pack?

[19-Sep-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Or more

[19-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> In europe like france or uk a 20 ciggarettes pack its about 10 euro

[19-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> or so

[19-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I dont have a specific place I sometimes live in Spain , then I live in France it depends

[19-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> there were times where I was spending like 200 euros per month in ciggarettes or even more , imagine all that money invested into crypto ahah

[19-Sep-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah its crazy

[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> iv recently quit smoking, like 12 months ago maybe a tad longer, i used to smoke a full 50 gram pouch of golden virginia in about 5 days and that went on for a good number of years, i was lucky enough to have a friend who was well in to vape pens, but not the little pen style ones, im talking about these big chonging sticks , cloud chasers they call them, sub ohm. anyway he talked me into giving it a go one day but you dont smoke it like a normal ciggarett , you have to take a big full lung inhale of the thing and so ik did, oh my god it felt so uncomfertable i couldnt understand how he could vape it like that, but after a few days i tried it again but i kept vaping it all day, the uncomfertablness  subsided after a good 10 - 15 goes of it, iv not gone back to the cancer sticks , yet. after about 2 months on the vape mod i bought , i waqs in work and a local vape shops warehouse was moving to a diffrent building in a different town , and the fella that ran the building with all the vape liquid stock in asked me if i wanted any free liquids, i was like err yeh , whats the catch, he said because the law had recently changed in the eu/uk , shops where no longer allowed to sell bottles of e liquids bigger than 10ml if it had nicotine in them, so he had loads of previous stock that was 60ml bottle size and had max 6mg nicotine in them, they was good quality american made e liquids so i was like ok how much can i have, he said as much as you want, i took 3 big pallets full of mixed 30ml bottles, and 60 ml bottles , some was 3mg nicotine some was 6 mg nicotine, and i also got a few boxes of 0 mg nicotine, 6000 bottles i got,needless to say i havnt bought 1 bottle of liquids from the shop since, all i get from the shops are my coils and they are fairly cheap ,

[19-Sep-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> vaping is not good for your health but from what iv seen and felt its a much better option than smoking cigaretts,

[19-Sep-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> sorry for the long essay 😬

[19-Sep-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i dont smoke so cant really offer much to this conversation. but i have read reports that vaping increases heart attack probability. could be that the stimulants in the product affect your heart much more than tobacco ...but not sure

[19-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> i could never bring myself to smoke. it's too much self destruction

[19-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I just can't bring myself to do it

[19-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> i am hoping to stop vaping all together one day,soon, at first when i started vaping i was on it all day every day but lately iv been slowing down using it and like i say hopefully one day i wil be vape and smoke free

[19-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> plus I don't want to spend that sort of money

[19-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> i started smoking cigaretts in my school years at the age of 15, im now 35

[19-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> if it wasn't so bad for you, I'd probably smoke though

[19-Sep-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'd try to grow and make my own so I wouldn't have to pay so much to buy them already made

[19-Sep-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> My father did quit smoking in 1 go

[19-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But he had 3 things that helped in some way

[19-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> wow thats some strong will hes got , good on him

[19-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Oh wait no I think two things

[19-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> My mother left him, and he found something else to do instead, sporting

[19-Sep-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> @✌Jellysmash✌ just read your article , nice and clear and very informative, 👍 👍

[19-Sep-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> 50 claps

[19-Sep-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> @SwimedDragon  sorry to hear about your mum leaving your dad, them situations are never a good thing

[19-Sep-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> but if it got your dad to quit smoking at least something good came from it.

[19-Sep-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Happened over 10 years ago, so I'm over that already haha. Yeah, it was a good thing for his health that it happened

[19-Sep-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> He finally stopped, my mother still smokes badly

[19-Sep-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anyone have opinions on the global economy?

[19-Sep-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The inequality of everyday people that want to buy a house or build one for their family to live and don't want to speculate owning more than one house.

[19-Sep-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> interesting...the more I research into puerto rico the more I see a great need

[19-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so much debt and so many houses decimated by hurricane

[19-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> people in sydney want 5 bedroom McMansions

[19-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> whilst people in other countries live in poverty

[19-Sep-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> we need to give those people a fair go and help them at least get the bare basics like a roof over their heads

[19-Sep-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Australia is a relatively ok economy by comparison but there are rural areas where there is poverty

[19-Sep-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> At the bare minumum, a storm shelter to retreat to.

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the only structure left standing

[19-Sep-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> For those that cant afford to excavate the ground to make a shelter

[19-Sep-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> just goes to show that the geodesic dome is hurricane resistant

[19-Sep-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> proof in the pudding

[19-Sep-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That's a monolithic dome. Geodesic domes are made up of octagonal sections on a frame.

[19-Sep-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Mornin' y'all.

[19-Sep-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Exactly

[19-Sep-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Both are very strong structures, but a monolithic dome is several orders of magnitude stronger. Both have the advantage of being a hemisphere, which tends to abosorb shock in a more equal manner, but the geodesic is made of sections, so it can break a little bit easier.

[19-Sep-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> that shelter is the bomb
