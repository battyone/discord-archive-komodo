[18-Aug-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Happy birthday @adriana  :Celebration:

[18-Aug-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not getting too old I hope, haha

[18-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm nearing 30, but I sometimes feel like I can't do half the stuff I did when I was 15.

[18-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I thought some of these ''getting older issues'' would happen a lot later. But I'm already spotting gray hair sometimes

[18-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmm, I don't seem to level up üòÆ

[18-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe it just levelled up without a notice

[18-Aug-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> üòÇ üòÇ

[18-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Any message I write can be the level up quote üòÆ

[18-Aug-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Never mind, I already seem to have one

[18-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> Nobody likes English football?
Premier League
I'm watching Tottenham

[18-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> some of my mates are obsessed with soccer i don't watch it much

[18-Aug-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you're playing it it's different, but I can't understand why people like to watch some of these sports that are out there

[18-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I don‚Äôt mind a bit of epl

[18-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ‚ú® ariewayq ‚ú® ! The Real Human> happy weekend

[18-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Doing good, preparing some dinner at the moment üòÉ How about you?

[18-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Yo

[18-Aug-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <x2maano> goat

[18-Aug-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> lol

[18-Aug-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We had chicken wraps, and I made potato's with brocolli for my son

[18-Aug-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Yummy

[18-Aug-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> What's your fav food

[18-Aug-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> I like seafoods

[18-Aug-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> @x2maano üòÑ

[18-Aug-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmmm, it's really hard to pick a favorite meal. I don't think I have one, but multiple ones

[18-Aug-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Often dishes with chicken with different Asian flavours and spices

[18-Aug-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't like seafoods for some reason. It's not that I don't like some, but I just never really want to eat it

[18-Aug-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Only thing I rarely eat are fish sticks

[18-Aug-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And kibbling (google did translation on that one haha)

[18-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Afternoon folks

[18-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hey Jonathan üëã

[18-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> I just had blooming onion yummm

[18-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> üëã

[18-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Last night wife made some gnarly steaks

[18-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Man, love those things lol

[18-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @Jonathan yeah it's been good eats...we had a date night so we ate and watched interstellar...it was a good night lol

[18-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Love the movie too, that is a good night üòÉ

[18-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Such a good movie üëç

[18-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> crazy how time works in it, and it's how time really works lol

[18-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> yeahh so good movie

[18-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> and i love physics tooo

[18-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Agreed!! What I really like about it is how Murphy's Law applies to everything that happens...everything that can goes  completely wrong every step of the way, but by the end you realize that everything had to go that exact way in order for the human race race to survive

[18-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I came close to being an astronomy major, picked computer science instead

[18-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> I mean the girls name was even Murph üòÇ 
Yeah the physics was awesome...loved the concept of gravity and love  transcending dimensions

[18-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm going with ()'toole's interpretation of Murphy's law: Murphy was an incurable optimist.

[18-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But Interstellar is a great movie üòÑ

[18-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Not familiar with that @Biomech-Founder - elaborate?

[18-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I did üòÑ

[18-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Murphy was an incurable optimist.

[18-Aug-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It'll go wrong whether it can or not.

[18-Aug-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> lol Oh, so shit hits the fan regardless?

[18-Aug-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ..and then the fan hits you üòõ

[18-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> LMAO

[18-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Ahahah!!

[18-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> This one started as a joke... But over the years I've come to think I'm on to something. I disagree with Einstein's view of the universal constant. He claimed the speed of light (which has since proved fairly variable :P).

[18-Aug-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm claiming perversity.

[18-Aug-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And the Universe seems to bear out my thought... ü§î

[18-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Yeah I think as far as the universe goes we're still about as knowledgeable as an infant knows calculus

[18-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Agreed. And we've come a long way in the half century I've been alive.

[18-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> The ocean as well

[18-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> True

[18-Aug-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I categorically do NOT believe that the speed of light is the ultimate barrier, and I believe we'll breach it some way. I base this partly on desire, but mostly on the fact that we have broken every 'ultimate' speed limit that the great thinkers and lesser lights have ever laid on us.

[18-Aug-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Plus, physics implies tachyons üòÑ

[18-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The ocean is a valuable target for humanity's expansion, if we do it careful. seasteading is one of my long term goals with this project.

[18-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I think it's an barrier but we'll break the law like star trek.......bend space

[18-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @Biomech that'd be awesome

[18-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> That's freakin awesome, seasteading

[18-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> A warp shell is precisely where I think it'll go. The storyline physics fit known physics up to the point of tachyons üòÑ A warp shell is a tachyonic field that can be distorted directionally. The craft inside the field is moving in 'normal' space, but the tachyonic field is not üòÑ

[18-Aug-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As for seasteading... Been into that before the name was coined üòÑ

[18-Aug-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> I'll take two of these warp shells

[18-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The main reason I got into crypto is political. It is promoting the idea of decentralization. So far, just with currency. But the IDEA is important. Once it's demonstrated that it can work for the fuel of commerce, then people can be shown that it works at a societal level too.

[18-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Gunna need some Pringles for my travels as well...they may not have those in other galaxies

[18-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Plutonian Nyborg, extremely hot salsa, and a towel. Along with your up to date copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide...
