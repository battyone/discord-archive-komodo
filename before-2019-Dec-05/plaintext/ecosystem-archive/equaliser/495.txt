[dscrdeql] <c2k> Let's help Verus coin get listed on txbit.io Remember, you can vote every 24 hours. Winning this round looks completely within reach, and there are a little over 5 days left! Can we make it happen?! vote here  https://txbit.io/Coin 

This is another Komodo Ecosystem coin run by @miketout and im sure they would help us also if asked.

[02-Nov-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I dont think it deserves the valuation it has currently.

[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Have you considered trying to get listed at digitalprice.io? Although the volume is very low they just implemented z-transaction deposits and withdrawals which is a first. Clearly they are working hard on their product and are pretty dedicated.
