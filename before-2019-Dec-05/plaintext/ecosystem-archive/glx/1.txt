Hello GLX...Why wasn’t the ICO promoted?

[29-Aug-18 10:53 AM] jorian#4555
@glx

[30-Aug-18 05:16 AM] Mylo#8306
I don't think it has been done yet.   @siu - Chainmakers would know

[01-Sep-18 04:42 PM] Seko#7408
We should update that in the dICO list. The status there is „running since 15.08.18. https://dexstats.info/dico.php

[04-Sep-18 09:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Mark81 which version of hyper/barter/agama are you using?

[04-Sep-18 09:29 AM] Mark81#4505

[04-Sep-18 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Let me fire up barter in a bit

[04-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[04-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah but I'm in native...

[04-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Electrum seems to be down

[04-Sep-18 09:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Probably the reason why orderbooks are down

[04-Sep-18 09:50 AM] Mark81#4505
do  you have working peers for agama?

[04-Sep-18 09:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Let me check

[04-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but probably not

[04-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As they use the same spv servers

[04-Sep-18 09:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not on latest agama here

[04-Sep-18 09:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but for lite mode I dont think there were any changes

So @jorian or @siu - Chainmakers should probably take a look

[04-Sep-18 10:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@glx has informed us that they are changing strategy and will take down the servers, so the dICO will not take place. Sorry for the inconvenience.

[04-Sep-18 10:07 AM] Mark81#4505
Wtf? When that game out?

[04-Sep-18 10:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, and what will happen with the coins?

[04-Sep-18 10:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I have like 10k ish or so 😄

[04-Sep-18 10:11 AM] Mark81#4505
Is dexstats right on that they have already collected over 1.4million usd?

[04-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Mark81#4505
@siu @jorian

[04-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
atomicexplorer is probably working with spv servers as well?

[04-Sep-18 10:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah 10k glx it seems, bought it a while ago when I saw it on hyperdex I think

[04-Sep-18 10:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Well. They just informed me this weekend. And im trying yo get further communication from them

[04-Sep-18 10:16 AM] Mark81#4505
Just when my research came to that conclusion that i should participate. Good luck or bad luck maybe both.

[04-Sep-18 10:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The 1.4m they raised was mostly from private investors.

[04-Sep-18 10:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They where refactoring the dICO app to their taste.

[04-Sep-18 10:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They said they would use the chain. Just that thwy needed to "change strategy" for the time being.

[04-Sep-18 10:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I would definitively appreciate if @glx could come personally and address the issues.

[04-Sep-18 10:19 AM] Mark81#4505
Does that  plan going public had anything to do with it?

[04-Sep-18 10:21 AM] Mark81#4505
Or where that as their primary plan and secondary as doing dico.

[04-Sep-18 10:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If i had answers i would definitively pass them to you guys.

[04-Sep-18 10:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
As soon as i get them ill let you know.

[04-Sep-18 10:27 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is as unexpected for me as it is for you.

[04-Sep-18 10:32 AM] Mark81#4505
@siu - Chainmakers well it certainly aint your fault or @jorian

[04-Sep-18 10:34 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We were working on everything as we were supposed to.

[04-Sep-18 10:35 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Last thing was that they had reservations woth the dicoapp looks and wanted to customize it. I was helping their in house devs get this done.

[04-Sep-18 10:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
All of the sudden he messaged me this weekend saying they changed strategy.

[04-Sep-18 10:37 AM] Bitcoin Benny#9597
I am reaching out to GLX but have heard nothing as of yet. Will advise when I have official confirmation

✅ 

[04-Sep-18 10:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I was going to wait until i got further information on what was happening or for him to reach out personally but since there was no communication and there are funds at stake i prefer to make it public and keep people informed of what is happening

[04-Sep-18 10:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Thanks Ben!

[04-Sep-18 10:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Might be a good decision to have bought some on a whim a while back then...

[04-Sep-18 10:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And if not, then whatever, not that much on the line anyway 😄

I read the article, then the about page. Where's the meat? Lots and lots and lots of buzz words, no business model. Disrespectful to our team to drag us along, no communication. Big pass on this one.

[05-Sep-18 12:17 AM] bishop#9773
"To power the GLX.com network, GLX is studying various protocols including Bitcoin, Ether, Stellar, EOS, Komodo, etc., or the use of a proprietary GLX network token. Bitcoin Lightning seems to have the biggest development community and so far is our favorite." Yeah... because you initially wanted to launch on Komodo and now are changing to Lightning with no explanation. Just some BS excuse about development community after the fact, something that should have been determined prior to going down the KMD path.

[05-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Lolwut

[05-Sep-18 12:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Can you even launch a coin on bitcoin lightning

[05-Sep-18 01:07 AM] bishop#9773
Not that I am aware of. If you want to read this nonsense, look at the link glx posted a few up

[05-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not to be talking down or anything but if they think they can somehow launch on bitcoin, then it probably wouldn’t have worked out well anyway

[05-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
I remember the white paper wasn’t much mostly flashy pictures and having graphs in vr or something

[05-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hope everything works out for everyone though but yeah LOL did not know bitcoin could launch tokens

[06-Sep-18 05:17 AM] glx#4214
@bishop @joe2x4 @Deleted User - all, I think maybe you are not understanding the current review we are doing in terms of how we might pivot, or maybe you didn't read my full article.  We are exploring potential options because the alt coin market is in the toilet and I mentioned in my article does each platform really need their own token when making simple payments such as monthly subscription fees can be done using BTC, ETH, etc.  We are certainly not trying to launch a colored coin on the BTC network.  We are a US based company and have other options for raising capital to continue to build our network.  As I mentioned in my article the biggest threat is SEC intervention which can shut a startup down completely.  That certainly will not help me get the company where I know it can go.  I am also not sure that anyone here besides @Cryptoon and @siu - Chainmakers knows much about the GLX.com network or what I am trying to build.  I invite you to log in there and connect with me to chat directly.

[06-Sep-18 08:29 AM] Seko#7408
Clear is, that crypto is very hazardous, but you play with the money of the token holders. Sorry GLX, but business is not a „kindergarten“.

[06-Sep-18 08:34 AM] Seko#7408
You can’t take money and then say, that you have now another strategy. And that you say 2-3 weeks later, while you took money from people who believed in you and the token.

[06-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Seko#7408
There are people, they wrote me and said, that GLX is a scam. But all this people I pass on to you.

[06-Sep-18 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
@glx have you considered letting users pay monthly fees via barterdex with any coin you're willing to support?

[06-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Alright#0419
you can set up LPs, let people pay you in any coin you like via atomic swaps with your coin

[06-Sep-18 03:35 PM] glx#4214
@Seko - I am sorry for any confusion in the marketplace.  Truthfully I have never even checked any of my wallets on the marketmaker nodes to know if any contributions came in.  This is actually very pleasant for me to here that there has been some interest.  I have asked people to sign into GLX and chat with me there either directly or in the GLX Token group.  I am happy to refund any tokens that were sent in.   We are going to be creating a security token backed by shares in our company and can issue those in receipt of the utility tokens or again can provide a full refund.

[06-Sep-18 03:37 PM] glx#4214
@Alright - on the network token side that is exactly what we planned on doing and are going to continue to do.  The fact that I stated we may look at some other options is just show further support to my existing investors that our choice to go with Komodo is still the most intelligent.

@Seko - Please try to direct anyone using the word "scam" to my attention.  The idea of that is a total joke.  Many ICO projects that have raised money have shut down or disappeared completely with no sign.  We are a real company with a real working platform.  We have audited financial statements with plans of going public on the NASDAQ or a regulated token exchange.  Anyone saying this knows nothing about GLX.

[06-Sep-18 07:15 PM] Seko#7408
@glx Can you please give me a contact address so that I can forward all requests? About facebook and telegram I have received inquiries and complaints.

[07-Sep-18 01:40 AM] glx#4214
Anyone can sign up at GLX.com and connect with me there. Our GLX Token chat group can be found by searching “GLX Token”. I am available at rr@glx.com.

There goes my mining rig time giveaway.   Someone was gonna win like 50-60 KMD too to put towards the dICO.

I am sorry, what exactly is going on with the GLX project? I just joined this discord group.

[11-Sep-18 10:49 AM] glx#4214
I apologize for delayed responses. I am currently in Colombia working with our dev team.  I think we have found the best path to using the GLX Token and all the Komodo software to power the GLX network.  I will have more concrete answers soon.

[11-Sep-18 12:35 PM] bishop#9773
@glx  so now you are back to using KMD's asset chains??

[11-Sep-18 06:54 PM] glx#4214
We have amazing plans for the GLX Chain. We never said we were not going to use it just additional review of all options and extra comfort on the regulatory end.

[11-Sep-18 07:26 PM] BTC-BTC-BTC#4223
Great to know the project is going forward. For the people got the glx thru the Dico, it still good for any future swap if your team decide to switch? I like the project and hope I can just hold it for  long term.  @glx

[13-Sep-18 03:02 PM] glx#4214
We have been working very hard behind the scenes.  I appreciate everyones support.  I will try to do a better job of keeping the community informed.  We are standing by Komodo 100% to power our platform.  We are going to develop some very cool stuff very fast.  All one has to do is go to our Labs page and see the impressive way in which we position GLX and the Komodo platform to understand what is to come - https://glx.co/labs.

To stay clear of regulatory scrutiny we are not going to execute the dICO to raise funds to expand development.  We will do that with our equity.  We are going to refund everyones contributions in full and also let you keep the GLX Tokens.  As many of you know Benny Fairbank and I are good friends and he is on our advisory board.  I will be working closely with him and Chainmakers to create many different airdrops and ways to give away half of our token supply to the member base.  I would really appreciate any help and ideas from the whole Komodo community as well.
