what are the chain params, I will update channel purpose with it

@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 you have minis on MGNX?

[06-Oct-18 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
no, just staking and PoW via CPU

[06-Oct-18 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
can't remember if this is accurate on ac_staked chains, but `"networksolps": 29577`

What is mgnx?

[06-Oct-18 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
An independent assetchain

[06-Oct-18 09:43 PM] wookie#7663
is there a pool for mgnx?

[06-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
@xRobeSx had one

[06-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
pretty sure he'd set it up again if there was interest

[06-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
think he took it down because no one was using it

[06-Oct-18 10:14 PM] wookie#7663
so everyone's just solo mining?

[06-Oct-18 10:15 PM] wookie#7663
I looked at magna a few months back, I can't seem to find the reason why magna is switching to magnax

[06-Oct-18 10:16 PM] wookie#7663
how do I get started mining mgnx? @Alright

[06-Oct-18 10:23 PM] Alright#0419
have you ever solo mined? https://github.com/webworker01/knomp best place to start

Thanks. No, I've never solo mined.

[06-Oct-18 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
if you try to set it up, just ping me with any problems you have

[06-Oct-18 10:33 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks, but I don't understand anything in there at all. I can follow instructions if laid out step by step, but I don't know what I'm doing...

[06-Oct-18 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
@wookie install dependencies, clone repo, `npm install` then ping me and I'll help your with the config files

[06-Oct-18 10:50 PM] wookie#7663
Really appreciate your help. I'll try it out when I get back to my PC.

[07-Oct-18 01:48 AM] house#8741
*Freshie Question:* Once I have the chain in sync, how do I run cpu to mine ?

[07-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its 90% PoS ... you better off staking

[07-Oct-18 01:49 AM] house#8741
ah

[07-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you can try to PoW mine `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX setgenerate true <threads>`

[07-Oct-18 01:49 AM] wookie#7663
so if I have no mgnx at all, no point trying to mine? and all I have is a 1080

[07-Oct-18 01:49 AM] house#8741
in seperate cmd window ?

[07-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cpu mine for a few weeks you will get some blovks eventually

[07-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when the PoS % gets ocer 90% the PoW diff is very easy

[07-Oct-18 01:50 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`and all I have is a 1080` that should be plenty to get you started, but bear in mind that it's only 10% PoW

[07-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like super super easy

[07-Oct-18 01:50 AM] house#8741
kk, thanks, really just learning curve here

[07-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD PoS chains are not simple

[07-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if your smart,you can stake a LOT more coins than someone who doesnt know how it works

[07-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my staker is a full VM that runs 9 daemons (copies of the chain) and about 1000 lines of bash scripts 游땍

[07-Oct-18 01:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
mawr UTXOs.... you always want mawr UTXOs

[07-Oct-18 01:52 AM] house#8741
where to buy ... only BarterDEX?

[07-Oct-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... but at come point too many uxto will slow it down... buy off @Alright

[07-Oct-18 01:52 AM] wookie#7663

*Shouts down the hallway*
@Alright  "Yo ..."!

[07-Oct-18 01:53 AM] wookie#7663
it's also, should I use my 1080 to get 4 pirates a day or point it to this

[07-Oct-18 01:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_consolidated to just 640 UTXOs and couldn't PoS but 20% of blocks 游땴_

[07-Oct-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I think gettting as much age as possible is still the best trategy, which requires hacving as many utxo as possible.... also then once you get over 10,000 splitting the address's over more daemons helps to get more efficancy

[07-Oct-18 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`it's also, should I use my 1080 to get 4 pirates a day or point it to this`
If you feel that this coin will gain traction, then this one is a better choice

[07-Oct-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this coin was dead before it started :trollface:

[07-Oct-18 01:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

I looked at magna when it was offering mn's a few months ago but I decided against it, I'm just now seeing that it's adding mgnx on top of magna mn's? But I can't find out what it does

[07-Oct-18 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`we used it to test PoS/PoW chains and hard forked it 4 times in the process`
To be fair....
This coin started before PoS was in beta and the HFs were protocol changes

[07-Oct-18 01:58 AM] wookie#7663
@blackjok3r thanks for the honesty!

[07-Oct-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dev seems incompetent, lauching a chain she was told was not going to work....

[07-Oct-18 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
agreed with that

[07-Oct-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you never know

[07-Oct-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it could be good... the software is now stable

[07-Oct-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It does get he 游끥  for being the first KMD PoS chain

[07-Oct-18 02:01 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm not giving an opinion on the coin (one way or another) and my 游냡ishness has always been available for anyone that wanted it
My point was to say that it's not like we HFed the coin because MGNX was bad, it happened because of things we were working out within the Komodo protocol

[07-Oct-18 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
And for the record, I'm the smaller 游냡 :abusedsmily:

[07-Oct-18 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
if you wanted a good chunk of MGNX, put a GPU or two on it now

[07-Oct-18 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
and start staking the coins

[07-Oct-18 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
you'll get about 10% of blocks each day with minimal hashrate then can stake those block rewards

[07-Oct-18 02:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what is mgnx ?

[07-Oct-18 02:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't been keeping myself updated with new chains in komodo ecosystem

[07-Oct-18 02:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@grewalsatinder It was the 1st independent coin that sprang out of our PoS testing.

[07-Oct-18 02:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh that's cool! 游뗵

[07-Oct-18 02:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from staked testing ?

[07-Oct-18 02:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
MGN folks found out PoS was going to be an option and decided to come on board

[07-Oct-18 02:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is there btt ann for it?

[07-Oct-18 02:54 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
It was just before STAKED

[07-Oct-18 02:54 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes, there's an ANN, MGN was an existing coin/community

[07-Oct-18 02:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
was it based on independent code or from eth erc20 tokens ?

[07-Oct-18 02:55 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
iirc MGN was a masternode bitcoin fork

[07-Oct-18 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like dash/pivx ?

[07-Oct-18 02:55 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
barterDEX was main reason for coming over

[07-Oct-18 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@Alright  may not be a bad idea,  the PoW part is it equihash or verushash

[07-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
equihash

[07-Oct-18 04:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Going to attempt to make my first solo pool, building Komodo now

[07-Oct-18 04:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Might as well throw one miner onto it,  get some coins to stake
