lol, I think it's getting attention because it's listed so close to the pirate channel! 🤣

[07-Oct-18 02:01 PM] wookie#7663
that's how it caught my attention, I don't really pay much attention to the other projects further up the ecosystem list🤣

[07-Oct-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@wookie it wasn't a komodo sub-channel before yesterday

[07-Oct-18 02:02 PM] wookie#7663
yeah, and is it me or has the number of projects in the ecosytem almost(?) doubled in the last 1-2 months?

@wookie We have a couple of things planned for MGNX. The first is to have an MGN and MGNX trading market, so one can atomically swap between the coins. 

**Summary of what's planned**

*MGN is a PIVX fork and by default BIP65 is not activated.  This would have to be added for MGNX to be atomic swap capable and therefore compatible for the BarterDEX

*Create the front end for the colored token DEX on MGNX. Add some reward programs that incentivize people to start creating tokens for attracting liquidity. 

*Offchain governance system that incorporates both Magna and MagnaX. The reasoning for offchain over onchain is justified in the whitepaper, which should be released by the end of month.  After implementation, we would go 1 layer deeper and start integrating colored tokens to the mix, by giving them their own governance.

[07-Oct-18 03:46 PM] MagnaDev#7112
@blackjok3r I was aware that there was no PoS asset chain, and that it was still in testing after the first chain restart. Also, made it to clear to the Magna community that the chains were in testing and there was no guarantee for stability or them being bug free.  I did really want MGNX to get that first mover advantage of being the first ever PoS asset chain.

[07-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Alright#0419
to be fair, the bugs likely wouldn't have been ironed out without MGNX

[07-Oct-18 03:57 PM] bishop#9773
So is the chain stable now without more resets?

[07-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
Yes

[07-Oct-18 03:57 PM] bishop#9773
good good

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
Will pay 20k MGNX for staking UTXO management scripts

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Alright#0419
have neglected my wallet for too long now. Has about ~30k UTXOs

[07-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
publicly released scripts that is

[07-Oct-18 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You almost had me selling until that last bit 😛

[07-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Alright#0419
how much?

[07-Oct-18 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I dunno, I'll look and see if I can't find mine tomorrow. What exactly do you need?

[07-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Alright#0419
I'd like something where I can set the number of UTXOs I'd have in each segid, then it keep my total balance split evenly over each

[07-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Alright#0419
and not just resend them all at once, as I don't want staking downtime after sending the txs

[07-Oct-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
off the top of my head, I think I can combine one of mine and one of joker's to do that; just have to check the vm in the morning to see what's where

[08-Oct-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine would not be able to do that, my script litterally works only to make  MORRREE utxo

[08-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
I can't get my wallet to do *anything*

[08-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
>~30k UTXOs is seemingly the limit

[08-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
for this machine at least

[08-Oct-18 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
not even sure what to do with this lmao

[08-Oct-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
need to create raw txs based on addressindex data I guess

[08-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used multiple daemons to spread the load out... There REALLY needs to be the wallet seperate from the coin daemons

[08-Oct-18 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you cna run 1 full node and liek 500 wallets daemons connected to it, so you dont need 500 copies of the blockchain

[08-Oct-18 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Grin chain uses that model and it seems 1000x better

[08-Oct-18 10:33 AM] Vitus#5784
How to calculate the optimal amount of input?

[08-Oct-18 10:35 AM] CHMEX#0686
Make sure you have at least 64 addresses one in each segid. Split your balance to those 64 addresses.

[08-Oct-18 10:36 AM] Vitus#5784
for example, I have 100k. Better than 1000 inputs of 100 or 100 inputs of 1000. If the second, reward will come less often given the maturation period

[08-Oct-18 10:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
With 100k I would do 777 mgnx x 64 addresses x 2 uxto per address

[08-Oct-18 10:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
And mine without pubkey so it assigns a new address and segid each time

[08-Oct-18 10:41 AM] Vitus#5784
I split by 10, 100, 500, 1000 and received about 60-80 rewards at one address per day

[08-Oct-18 10:44 AM] Vitus#5784
how to check network weight?

[08-Oct-18 10:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have no idea how to calculate that.

[08-Oct-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there are 64 different network weights, one for each segid

[08-Oct-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
would not be easy to have a realtime weight, utxo age by segid needs to be tabulated

[08-Oct-18 11:08 AM] Vitus#5784
What the number of rewards per day from 64 addresses with a total balance of 100k splited by 2 inputs of 777?

[08-Oct-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
plz let us know

[08-Oct-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
too many variables to know by any other means than actual measurement

[08-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Vitus#5784
I meant to check the overall weight of the network like Dash fork

[08-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Vitus#5784
"weight" : 47280121317870,
"netstakeweight" : 171566194010567,

are there any ways to encrypt MGNX wallet.dat?

[08-Oct-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CHMEX  if your a giant whale, using that method is a bad idea... Alright ended up with 33,000 utxo and the wallet simply stopped responding and the node cannot stake.

[08-Oct-18 11:49 AM] CHMEX#0686
So it would be better to mine to one address and consolidate and distribute from another node back to the addresses?
I believe jl had at some point 500k uxtos in one of the pos64 testchains with his ramstaker?

[08-Oct-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, ramstaker is built in, but that was a decent spec server

[08-Oct-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
on a more limited node, maybe it would bog down sooner

[08-Oct-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alrights stopped at 33,000 utxo

[08-Oct-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also was wondering how exactly that happened as I also remebered you haev 500,000 utxo ... and thaught maybe it was because of hte mumber of address only

[08-Oct-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My method creats as many utxo as possible but usies only 64 address, but I never got it over 5000 utxo or so

[08-Oct-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and also always used 8 daemons for the staking, and 9th for the consolidation/distibution of funds

[08-Oct-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i havent made any changes with the RAMstaker which runs automatically

[08-Oct-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did you use 64 address for the 500k test?

[08-Oct-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or a new address for each utxo?

[08-Oct-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this seems the only diffrence if so

[08-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i dominated all 64 segids

[08-Oct-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
starting much later

[11-Oct-18 06:54 AM] dEBASERpIX [evonodes.com]#3411
I see all this talk about optimizing utxo for staking but can't get my head around it how it works. Anybody a link to a good explanation, really would like to know how this works.

[11-Oct-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There really isnt anything made yet... I was working on it for staked, but we stopped staking there and moved to a notary system and until thats finished we wont be going back to PoS chains.

[11-Oct-18 08:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dEBASERpIX [evonodes.com]   Imagine 1000 coins are currently staking  on the network. And you have 100 of them.  Staking as one utxo of 100 coins is not as preferable to staking 100 utxos of 1 coin .  Due to staking age,  block reward system and txfees

[11-Oct-18 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Using KMD PoS the age value seems most important,  every time a utxo stakes a block, its age is reset, so having more utxo gives you more age over time.

[11-Oct-18 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As for creating enough utxo ... its really just too complicated to explain really..

[11-Oct-18 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You want to lookup `sendmany` and learn how to use it ...

[11-Oct-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
create your 64 addresses, then creat a script that builds a sendmany JSON from those 64 addresses. So you can send X coins to the 64 addresses in giant TX's rather than 1 at a time.

@MagnaDev could you share more of your vision/plan for Magna + MagnaX? All I know of Magna is that it's a MN, and MGNX is to be a second layer that has dPoW/PoS. What's your long term idea? Thanks.

I know of one possible, but it depends on several factors, but the BTC downturn might be a killer for them

[11-Oct-18 02:41 PM] wookie#7663
what's LP?

[11-Oct-18 02:43 PM] SHossain#0007
Bob or whoever provides liquidity

We don't use the term LP anymore. We just use `bob`.
