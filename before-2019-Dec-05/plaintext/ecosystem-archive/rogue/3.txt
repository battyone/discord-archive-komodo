With 2 slow digestion . Two rings can cancel out food consumption. Tested and worked! Really usefull for farming between lvl 1-6.

[26-Feb-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh thats cool - can have more space in inventory that way

[26-Feb-19 03:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[26-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@ronyi  I'm going to announce you as the winner on twitter and medium with some additional info, including your strategy, if that is ok with you.

[26-Feb-19 05:07 PM] ronyi#5719
@Cryptofist naturally.

[26-Feb-19 07:01 PM] wookie#7663
is it possible to transfer items between warriors?

[26-Feb-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
no. the rogue items arent unique in and of themselves, even if they are very rare

[26-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
for NFT, you want unique properties, which a player+pack will get

[26-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
now maybe there is a demand for FT so people can buy specific things like food, weapons, magics... but I think that would make the game too easy

[26-Feb-19 10:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Not if the in app purchases were for clothing and visual GUI things....I think I see a way....upgrading level s/weapons should be expensive and difficulty could also rise if i am understanding this D&D game correctly

[26-Feb-19 10:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Just wondering if GUI should be updated to 3d and researching how to integrate with roblox...

[26-Feb-19 11:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@kmdkrazy  any serious advancement of gameplay should be another game  really.

[26-Feb-19 11:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
BUT if the talent is around.... D&D or other table tops are a great place to start for creating new games.

[26-Feb-19 11:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe have you son try his hand at game dev with unity?

[27-Feb-19 11:06 AM] ronyi#5719
Favorite monster ability: "N" stole items, "A" weaken your armor, "L" give or stole gold,  "R" - strenght, "F" catch you,  "I" hypothermia, did I miss something?

[27-Feb-19 12:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I havent been any farther down. Zombie is the only other I can think of

[27-Feb-19 12:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504

[27-Feb-19 01:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Are you writing something up, @ronyi?  I'd be keen to have a look if you are! üó∫ :treasure:

[27-Feb-19 01:20 PM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but my english is not perfect, but if you proofread, then of course.

[27-Feb-19 01:33 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL just to clarify, if I quit in the middle of fighting a monster, but my warrior is still alive, does my warrior get saved? I had 3 consecutive games where I quit and not get saved (the most painful loss was 3000+ gold, level 12)

[27-Feb-19 01:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yes IF you got gold + killed at least one monster @wookie

[27-Feb-19 01:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
OR it is supposed to be that way

[27-Feb-19 01:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Please let us know any time something like that happens, the devs might want more info so save the output print post game please.

[27-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ALSO, that sucks! I can send you some ROGUE if you want.

[27-Feb-19 02:15 PM] wookie#7663
@Cryptofist Yes. That happened yesterday. a level 12, 3000+ gold, a level 11 2000+ gold, and something else smaller. I thought it was resolved, but apparently it's still around. Is there a way for me to look up the post game output? I closed the windows terminal yesterday. @TonyL  this is using your 0.11n tui

[27-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Did you update everything else?

btw, what's the difference between using this #rogue channel and the #cc-rogue channel? Not sure which one to post questions in.

[27-Feb-19 03:00 PM] Cryptofist#7504

[27-Feb-19 07:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Bundles have both not up to date TUI and daemon already. I'll update bundles soon (now daemon in testing)

[27-Feb-19 07:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@wookie JL updated and fixed the big bad bad bug

[27-Feb-19 07:27 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks @Cryptofist. @TonyL can you please ping me when bundles are ready?

[27-Feb-19 07:29 PM] TonyL#3577
@wookie I'll pin it in #cc-rogue and in #rogue , may forget to update you personally since it might be done not today

[27-Feb-19 07:30 PM] wookie#7663

Hey! You're most welcome!

[01-Mar-19 05:27 PM] wookie#7663
I've noticed this in the last few games: when I restart a new game with my saved warrior, the HP is much lower than when I quit the game. Is that an expected aspect?

[01-Mar-19 06:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yes, it should always be 12 @wookie

[02-Mar-19 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to start daemon first for ROGUE chain: 
```./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon
