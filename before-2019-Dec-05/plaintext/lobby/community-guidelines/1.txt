**Our Approach**

Komodo is an open source project that relies on community contributions and user-driven activity. Thus it is of utmost importance that the Komodo community maintain a civil and friendly atmosphere. 

Komodo‚Äôs priority is to create a supportive and encouraging community, where everyone is free to participate in discussion, exchange ideas, and collaborate to build things with Komodo‚Äôs technology. Conversations about blockchain technology, crypto markets, industry trends, and current events are all highly encouraged. 

There is no censorship on the Komodo Discord server unless the discussion involves out-right bigotry, threats, or excessively foul or abusive language. In addition, all discussions must take place in the appropriate channels and must be on-topic.
