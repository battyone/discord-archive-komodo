[09-Oct-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
we must all respect the #safespace rules, to include everyone and everything that is totally safe, but nothing else

[09-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Jonathan#3687
Excellent, for a minute I didn't feel safe anymore now I do

[09-Oct-18 06:22 PM] Hermes#6934

[12-Oct-18 08:23 PM] ch6ris#5240
escort has a negative connotation and  could be referring to something like prostitution. 😢

[12-Oct-18 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
how about he found the exit? 😉

[12-Oct-18 08:26 PM] ch6ris#5240
That sounds a lot safer to me. 👍

[12-Oct-18 08:28 PM] ch6ris#5240
although if someone was unable to find the exit, makes me think of tragedies such as house fires.
