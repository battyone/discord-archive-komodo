now that is not an appropriate thing to say in #safespace

[09-Oct-18 09:08 AM] ph03nix#3115
maybe it was important

[09-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
even though he promised never to be here, it is against the spirit of #safespace to make anybody feel unsafe

[09-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
please make the world a better place and only post happy things here

[09-Oct-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be misinterpreted and it is not safe

[09-Oct-18 09:10 AM] ph03nix#3115
good point

[09-Oct-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want a #sarcasm channel to feel empowered to be sarcastic, I can pretend to make it for you

[09-Oct-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
#safespace is a safe space, even for people wanting to be sarcastic. you just cant actually be sarcastic here

I think for every kitten pic/video, we need to have puppy pic/video, otherwise wouldnt it offend the puppy lovers?

[09-Oct-18 10:20 AM] ph03nix#3115
yes, this should be mandatory for #safespace

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
equality for all

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
everyone is the same

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody is different

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and unicorns!

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
and rainbows

[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] ph03nix#3115
yes

[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] ch6ris#5240
No freedom of speech just like Australia.

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] ph03nix#3115
we don't talk about freedom of speech in #safespace

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
that is unsafe

#safespace is not about freedome

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
or freedom

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it is about enslaving everybody to the least common denominator

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
puppies and kittens

[09-Oct-18 10:26 AM] ch6ris#5240
