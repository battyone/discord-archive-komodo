Never heard of xhv tbh, guess I'm out of the loop.

[21-Jan-19 11:25 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Tbh i stopped paying attention to most projects after seeing what komodo is capable of, I had never heard of XHV before either 🤣

[21-Jan-19 11:28 AM] ch6ris#5240
Yeah, I'm about the same. I'm all in on kmd and some of it's asset chains.

[21-Jan-19 11:28 AM] ch6ris#5240
zcash of course too.

alot of coins start with a high trading price but that was crazy

[21-Jan-19 11:37 AM] ch6ris#5240
Yeah zcash did that, 20btc or something close. btc was only worth around $800 at that time though. from memory don't trust my numbers.

[21-Jan-19 11:38 AM] ch6ris#5240
slow start and fomo, did that. then it slowly dropped to $30, When i bought a boat load. then it wen't to $600 and I didn't sell and back to where I started pretty much.

[21-Jan-19 11:40 AM] ch6ris#5240
At least zcash is legit with a real team/company/money.

[21-Jan-19 11:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah for sure. There aint many legit teams about. plenty of fluff projects around which are all falling apart now

At least its transparent CG everyone who mines know that

You'd be amazed at how many people using the NH mining app actually believe they are "mining Bitcoin" 😕

This space is still for those with above average technical skills. You'd be amazed at how many people can't install an operating system.

[21-Jan-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you mean im getting paid in btc but not mining btc!!!`
Nope, and using BitPay isn't vendors "accepting crypto-currency" either

[21-Jan-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`You'd be amazed at how many people can't install an operating system.`
No, I wouldn't 😛

[21-Jan-19 11:49 AM] ch6ris#5240
You should be. fact checked.

[21-Jan-19 11:49 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So you mean i paid for btc in £ to then purchase some nice bitcoin socks in btc for them to get £. Im really pissed

[21-Jan-19 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I live in a county of 15k people and I made a living (for nearly a decade) doing just that

[21-Jan-19 11:50 AM] ch6ris#5240
Cool story, how did you get started. I would love to do something similar.

[21-Jan-19 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
people, literally, paid me hundreds to drive 2 hrs and install the new Winduhs they bought at Walmart

[21-Jan-19 11:54 AM] ch6ris#5240
A country of only 15k and you have a walmart. I thought that was a u.s only company. Don't have any where I am.

[21-Jan-19 11:55 AM] ch6ris#5240
ohh no multinational.

[21-Jan-19 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Walmart is 2 counties over (almost an hr), but it's the only "big" store around

[21-Jan-19 11:56 AM] ch6ris#5240
ahh following. country lines are foreign to me because we don't have any. only ocean.

[21-Jan-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no "box stores" nearby, but we've got 900 gajillion gas stations 🤦🏽

[21-Jan-19 11:58 AM] ch6ris#5240
If I tried hard enough I could probably narrow down what country your in but I can't be bothered. 😂

[21-Jan-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`country lines are foreign to me `
here we have a "hierarchy" of govt:
local town/city >> county >> state >> federal

[21-Jan-19 12:00 PM] ch6ris#5240
Yeah it's probably about the same here. Councils run the town's/suburbs/city's. state government then federal.

[21-Jan-19 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we added counties between city and state because we like giving more money to govt :trollface:

[21-Jan-19 12:02 PM] ch6ris#5240
Who doesn't. Who else will maintain those roads.

The latest from the government here is half arse attempt of fiber.

Fiber to the x

[21-Jan-19 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have internet because some random company decided to buy as many small phone companies as they could and then they got bought by some other random company
meanwhile, the quality of service is better (as is the speed) in the middle of the Australian plains than it is here

[21-Jan-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have the 3rd largest ISP in the US and, literally, the same DSL lines we got a decade ago

[21-Jan-19 12:09 PM] ch6ris#5240
I am in the bush and I gotta say shit has indeed improved.

[21-Jan-19 12:10 PM] ch6ris#5240
That's a bit harsh. Guess you need another step in your local hierarchy, More money.

[21-Jan-19 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL

[21-Jan-19 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I called up about getting bonded 20M DSL and it took them 2 weeks of looking into it and event then they didn't comprehend that it's 2 service lines 🤦🏽

[21-Jan-19 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>How much is the wire going to cost me?
>>There's no need to run a new wire
>You're going to give me a bonded setup on the existing 2 wire line?
>>Yes

[21-Jan-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah internet here on NBN is great.... I'm 500-800m from the excahnge though... Even DSL wasnt bad.

[21-Jan-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Bought my house mostly because it was close to the main exchange

[21-Jan-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The sad thing is that I'm not exaggerating; by "2 wire" I literally mean that there are only 2 wires running from the trunk junction to our buildings (our system is *that* old)

[21-Jan-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
We don't even have the 4 wire that was "standard" by the time I was born (and I'm in my 40s)

[21-Jan-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wow... I think I have 4 wires... but they are not connected to anything. Still using DSL, but its very short range, get 100mbit but I'm only on 50 atm. as 50 gives 25mbit upload it seemed fine. Only been a few times I've wanted to get 100mbit... catn see it worth the extra cost atm.

[21-Jan-19 12:19 PM] ch6ris#5240
Where ever you are Geine, get out. backwards town going no where.

[21-Jan-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is still no option to use another provider... thats the real issue IMO.

[21-Jan-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100M here would cost 100s of millions because everything would have to be new

[21-Jan-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the austalian governement spent liek 40 billion on the current internet here

[21-Jan-19 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`backwards town going no where`
The cost of living in the middle of nowhere 😛

[21-Jan-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and its still not very good... governemtn owns the entire internet pretty much also that is very bad.

[21-Jan-19 12:20 PM] ch6ris#5240
and it's nothing compared to a country like Singapore for example (Half arse save money attempt)

[21-Jan-19 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The US govt has always owned the internet 😉

[21-Jan-19 12:20 PM] ch6ris#5240
They still do indeed.

[21-Jan-19 12:21 PM] ch6ris#5240
And could theoretically shut it down.

[21-Jan-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think not long ago 1 DNS server went down in US, and multiple cities had no internet... I thaught it was designed from the bottom up to prevent that from happening.. 😆

[21-Jan-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in other unrelated news, @blackjok3r, I've almost nailed down the js lib for using P2PK in coinbase 🙂

[21-Jan-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-Jan-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What about pay to multisig :trollface:

[21-Jan-19 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It still has *something* screwy where it makes KMD chain run a check that it should only run on assetchains, but I'm getting close for P2PK
I'm too lazy and uncaring for multisig atm 😛

[21-Jan-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-Jan-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I screwed up an if in the lib, somewhere, I guess; so, it produces something just on the edge of right enough to work, but wrong enough to send komodod down the wrong check path

[21-Jan-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Komodod checks are pretty complex in places...
