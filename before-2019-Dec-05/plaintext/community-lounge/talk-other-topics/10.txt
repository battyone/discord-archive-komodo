B√§ume sind f√ºr mich immer die eindringlichsten Prediger gewesen.
Ich verehre sie, wenn sie in V√∂lkern und Familien leben, in W√§ldern und Hainen. Und noch mehr verehre ich sie, wenn sie einzeln stehen.

Sie sind wie Einsame. Nicht wie Einsiedler, welche aus irgendeiner Schw√§che sich davongestohlen haben, sondern wie gro√üe, vereinsamte Menschen, wie Beethoven und Nietzsche. In ihren Wipfeln rauscht die Welt, ihre Wurzeln ruhen im Unendlichen; allein sie verlieren sich nicht darin, sondern erstreben mit aller Kraft ihres Lebens nur das Eine: ihr eigenes, in ihnen wohnendes Gesetz zu erf√ºllen, ihre eigene Gestalt auszubauen, sich selbst darzustellen.

Nichts ist heiliger, nichts ist vorbildlicher als ein sch√∂ner, starker Baum ....

Today is friday 13th and a super new moon. Not sure how the world can get much crazier tho, will we see a brief moment of sanity instead?

In Venezuela, Bitcoin Is a Lifeline
Here in Venezuela, where we are in the midst of a political and economic crisis, cryptocurrency is not a game. It is a safeguard of value and protection against the hyperinflation of our own currency, the bolivar.

This does not imply widespread cryptocurrency adoption in Venezuela, however, given the economic limitations of citizens who do not have the purchasing power to obtain a smart phone or computer with which to buy cryptocurrencies. One can trade cryptocurrency by text message (SMS) and other means, but sadly these avenues are not widespread in Venezuela.
