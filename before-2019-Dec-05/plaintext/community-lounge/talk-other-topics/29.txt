Good RPG games are already running on NEO and Ethereum.  Others are announced.  The games industry is so big.  I used to make money with Flashgames, then with HTML5, so why not blockchain games?

It will take a few more years, but if blockchain technology is going to be successful, it will be games on the blockchain. The market is so big.

If you get started now, you can achieve something big.

My dream for now is a simple penalty shootout...

[22-Oct-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
just need all the game devs

[22-Oct-18 09:36 AM] Seko#7408
Yeah! @PTYX So many games on Ethereum.  Maybe you can convince the developers to migrate to Komodo.

[22-Oct-18 09:44 AM] Seko#7408
@jl777c Are you looking for developers who can develop games on Komodo-Chain? Maybe Komodo can run a bounty ad?

[22-Oct-18 09:45 AM] Seko#7408
There are already developers wanted for 2FA on Blockchain for examples. You could hire a job as a game developer.

[22-Oct-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont have bandwidth to manage game development, it needs to come from ecosystem

[22-Oct-18 09:51 AM] Seko#7408
Yes, I understand. That means, the ecosystem 
Maybe the game channel is better suited to the topic? 
This means that the ecosystem finances, develops and manages?

As an example, even if for me it's probably one size too big.  I have the idea, I need the financing and I'm looking for developers?

[22-Oct-18 09:52 AM] Seko#7408
Just to give you an example.  Of course, it would be better to start with a team of several people who have an idea.

[22-Oct-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
a project manager could find the dev(s) and the financing

[22-Oct-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
a whale could find the dev

[22-Oct-18 11:24 PM] ch6ris#5240
Probably not Genie. All members are required to log into their account at least every 89 days or you will be deleted without warning.

[22-Oct-18 11:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh so they still want asslickers, good to see some things in the world never change

[22-Oct-18 11:28 PM] ch6ris#5240
You could look at it that way I guess. Active participation is a good thing  in the torrent world. There's always TPB.

[22-Oct-18 11:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
threatening to delete a user that has a 4500:1 ratio if they don't use the forum is stupid and every reason I stopped going there

[22-Oct-18 11:31 PM] ch6ris#5240
Good point, I can understand that.

[22-Oct-18 11:34 PM] ch6ris#5240
Not necessarily a need to use the forum. Just login to the site. I can really understand your point though.
