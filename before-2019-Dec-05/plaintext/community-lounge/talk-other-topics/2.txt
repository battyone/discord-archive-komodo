<@U0JUJF8RX> Huh, I'm glad you posted this. I'm trying right now to set up my own crypto accounting database and was wondering....

How did he come to this conclusion? The tax rate for short-term purchases/sales is upwards of 30-40%, but for long term it's more like 10-20%.

?

[31-May-18 04:03 PM] polycryptoblog#0000
Their tax accounting software,   bitcoin.tax      the problem last year taxwise at least is that huge run up we had at the end.    Was more beneficial to clear gains made from income/mining/rewards  first

[31-May-18 04:03 PM] 1stormingj#0000
LIFO is just deferring your costs to the future

[31-May-18 04:03 PM] 1stormingj#0000
And importantly, you need to maintain the same system across years

[31-May-18 04:04 PM] 1stormingj#0000
The IRS lets you pick, but requires consistency

[31-May-18 04:04 PM] polycryptoblog#0000
reduces future costs  by accumulating long term gains which are taxed at a lower rate.   I dont think FIFO will ever be more advantageous,  so no problem being consistent with LIFO

[31-May-18 04:05 PM] 1stormingj#0000
Yeah long terms gains is a reasonable LIFO argument

[31-May-18 04:05 PM] 1stormingj#0000
Could easily save you 10-20% or higher

[31-May-18 04:08 PM] siddhartha-komodo#0000

thats a very slippery slope.  1)  Historically, governments ostracize political dissidents by labeling them "crazy"  2)  The statement while surely not intending to, basically states that the lives of the mentally ill are not worth as much as a "normal" persons life,  as you take away their ability to defend themselves.  3)  What is the line where a person is "too crazy" to own a gun?   That line is decided by whatever public whimsy is popular at the time,  it never recedes in its strictness and always encroaches further
