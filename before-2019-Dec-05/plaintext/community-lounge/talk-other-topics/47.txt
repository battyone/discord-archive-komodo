building a very plugin heavy social site.  Switching dropped load time from 11s fully optimized ( unacceptable but time to paint was only 2.2sec so was not too noticeable as the user could interact with the site well before 11s full load ) to 4.8 sec not fully optimized yet

Decentralization or Dapps need to be focused toward convenience ...People use Amazon services because of convenience. Even though people know how bad Amazon treat their workers...so this thing about dapps is not fully about decentralization and good ethic environment but convenience ...human behavior cannot be changed so fast...

[29-Jan-19 07:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Even though people know how bad Amazon treat their workers...`
Are they (the workers) slaves?

[29-Jan-19 07:06 AM] Hermes#6934
Paycheck to paycheck slaves in some cases ... but mainstream users won’t care too much ...so Dapps at the end will need to have that little  ingredient or percentage based in convenience for the current state of human behavior...

Amazon is the perfect example of how those workers are exploited ...logistics around the world are done by slaves and then it will be done by robots ...so at the end same as the fired journalists from Buzzfeed “Learn to code”

[29-Jan-19 07:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) they weren't slaves
2) they had freedom of choice
3) the 1st bad exchange with an employer is on the employer, the 2nd and any successive interaction is on the employee
4) If you spent 13 years being educated and the best you have to offer the world is that which can be done by a mindless robot, then you really don't have much to offer the world....

[29-Jan-19 07:17 AM] Hermes#6934
But the part of the convenience would take a great piece of the market ...I was thinking about creating an assetchain from a JavaScript based app in my cellphone ...that would be convenient

5) you'll find little sympathy from the guy that lost __everything__ except his truck and 2 changes of clothing and did something about his life

[29-Jan-19 07:18 AM] Hermes#6934
So making the dapps convenient is where the money is ...people at the end won’t care how decentralized the dapps is but how convenient is to use it ...same as Amazon

[29-Jan-19 07:21 AM] Hermes#6934
It’s sociologically interesting  in some way ...because it means that human nature is based in convenience rather than fully decentralized or ethics focused applications ...they just care that it delivers...or fulfill its function.

Hello fellow bitcoiners,

Yesterday one of my friend was robbed at his house by 3 men in Oman. Thankfully he was not injured in the robbery but got 3k+ BTC and ~6M AED (cash) stolen, as well as some physical BTC and a few paintings.

if they force you to give up privkeys etc etc

[29-Jan-19 09:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Only thing you can do is make they physically unavailable  or something like that

[29-Jan-19 09:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"paper wallets" are nothing more than a priv key; however, even if you ascribe to the notion of the claim that it's "physical" because it's physically written down on a tangible object, it's still not "physical BTC" because it's a controlling ownership code for some BTC amount and not actual BTC (a paper wallet that has the priv key for an address that has 1000000 BTC is physically indistinguishable from a paper wallet that has the priv key for an address that has 0 BTC)
