George Orwell is obviously a writer of great insight. the Chinese society, which is using digital technology to strengthen its surveillance and control to an unprecedented level (including digital currency), might be benchmarking <1984>

but I personally think Aldous Leonard Huxley <Brave New World> is one more forward-looking book than Animal Farm and 1984. the extermination of humanity proceeds quietly, quickly and destructive within those who are domesticated by ignorance and obedience rather than external coercive violence.

the opiod crisis, the medical industrial complex and the fact that medical errors are the third leading cause of death. lowest birthrates in history in most 1st world countries. plunging fertility rates and life expectancies. Aldous Huxley's vision has become reality.

we used to be concerned with colonizing the stars and advancing civilization and technology. now we have stagnated, it truly feels like the ambition of those in power is to divide and control ideaologies in pursuit of greed.

Just added a feature at the bottom of the homepage of Privacy Alternatives. 
It's similar to Reddit, links to articles can be upvoted/downvoted. I'm keeping it simple for now, but I might add more features in the future, like the ability for visitors to add their own links. But that would take time for moderation of spam. Also, at least for now, I quite like offering the ability to vote without registration
Feel free to try it : )
I also just added the SevenSeas Pirate wallet in the wallets section, will create a dedicated page for it later

Yeah :) He is very pro human, tech secondary. Elon is pure tech guy more aware of possibilities, limits and consequences.

[29-Aug-19 11:34 PM] PTYX#6840
Jack is pragmatic. I wouldn't say pro human. Do you think he lets his employees work 3 days a week and 4 hours a day?

[29-Aug-19 11:35 PM] PTYX#6840
Elon is more pro human/consciousness in my opinion. Both types of people have great qualities but Jack was out of his league talking about AI. He almost sounded ignorant.

nothing man made comes close to the human brain so far

[30-Aug-19 12:00 AM] phideas#8309
Jack's vision actually is pro human. Work less, live healthier, be happy.  He thinks ai and tech will help humans to reach this vision and I agree with him on that. It is in line also with Peter Diamandis vision of abundance via technology. True that he lacks deeper tech knowledge, he rely on his intuition.
Elon see far more into the future, he see things like ai taking over and humans left behind. Little pessimistic b/c he see the inevitable destiny of humans.
I think both could be right in different timeframes.

Among the coins that have been added to the Samsung phone, apart from Bitcoin, are now Binance Coin (BNB), and the major stablecoins, such as TrueUSD (TUSD), Maker (MKR) and USD Coin (USDC). All in all, 33 digital coins are now supported by the smartphone.
