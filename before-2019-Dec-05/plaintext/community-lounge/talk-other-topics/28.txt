The comments need to be quality to count @MoldyLunchbox.

Thank you for your feedback on the matter. I'm looking forward to Komodo's future.

Can someone launch a Roubini assetchain?
could be 50% PoS , 50% Pow, verus clone
The cryptosphere would love this coin, just imagine buying coffee from Starbucks and paying in 'Doom' dollars, maybe 100 nouriels in every $Doom
Dr Doom needs a meme coin asap

[19-Oct-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think verus has all komdo AC options.. so thats perfectly possible...

[19-Oct-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
From working with komodo code to make the streamer and staked, most of the verus stuff is already in there as far as options to enable go, but its is just a stub, that leads no where,  guess waiting for PR next election to merge back down all over verus's updates.

[19-Oct-18 03:22 AM] Don King#8901
Could be a use case for staked streams, combat fake news, have all political policies, press releases, speeches etc on a blockchain for verification, stop fake news

Could this be chain named in honour of Roubini? That dude is good for marketing

[19-Oct-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I envision this is what it should be used for... but I also see very quickly if it starts getting used for such things, those very people using it for horrible things, and then saying thats what and all its used for üò¶

[19-Oct-18 03:48 AM] gcharang#6833
I think if someone really wanted to start a 50% PoS - 50% PoW chain right now , then they could contact Verus Devs to see if it's possible to clone the Verus repo and use the komodod built from it to spawn a new chain

[19-Oct-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make a 50/50 chain with komodo anyway

[19-Oct-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Verus's implementation is just a bit diffrent

[19-Oct-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and verusu itself is an AC of the verus komodod, so there sbsolutly nothing stopping you from just using thier binary to start a chain with diffrent parameters.

[19-Oct-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No need to contact their devs and annoy them

[19-Oct-18 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would ot it right now, but I have more important things to do ... advice is look at the contents of the script `verusd`

[19-Oct-18 03:56 AM] Don King#8901
@blackjok3r , staked just needs one legit use case that shows off the tech, then it becomes just like any other tool, like a knife of hammer, can be used for good or evil. Will there be a new staked coin, or some airdrop for kmd and/or Supernet, how do you devs get compensated if staked streams go viral?

[19-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Don King#8901
Do you get a royalty for each staked clone?

[19-Oct-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The streaming chain itself is a new chain spawened by the creator of the stream, the notaisation of it will be paid in STAKED...

[19-Oct-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarisation makes it immutable

[19-Oct-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anyone can use hte stream withoutnotarisation for free ... of it they want, they could launch their own notaries

[19-Oct-18 03:59 AM] Don King#8901
Ok, so launching a staked stream is basically free, just dPoW fees?

[19-Oct-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked notaries subscribe to trusted oracles to fetch new chain parameters ... I dont see nefarious actors, being trusted by staked notaries, so they would need to create thei own notary network to notarise those.

[19-Oct-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first step is to make it work ...

[19-Oct-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until that time all we can do is guess

[19-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Don King#8901
Ok, I see unlimited possibilities in copyright alone, put creative work on a blockchain secured by bitcoin, then you can always proof you created music, writings, anything

[19-Oct-18 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, this was my first thaught of this, although if the creator of the content never did it first, someone could steal it, stream it to a secured chain and them try to claim ownership, so some kind of stanndard would need to be created ... or verus's work on decentalised ID's or soemthing would need to be incorperated

[19-Oct-18 04:04 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, would need to stream content plus identity almost immediately, very powerful tech

Will there be airdrop, how can I buy some staked?

[19-Oct-18 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The fact that the chain creator, uses a public/private key they own, already incorperates some kind of ownership

[19-Oct-18 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked emmission is still not 100% finalised.. there is already some coins that exist, but they are held in a json by alright from staked4.

[19-Oct-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The early testers will NOT be getting all their coins at the outset to stake ... as that would just amke them giant whales... and we want to avoid that happening.

[19-Oct-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Some kind of time lock on them will be applied

[19-Oct-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The thing with staked is that it can be as many chains as we want each serving a diffrent purpose.. and you can move your staked to any chain you like. We will likey have all chains as -ac_public=1 and a single chains (likey the main chain) where private TX will be possible, to focuse the sheilded coins all into 1 chain.

[19-Oct-18 04:08 AM] Don King#8901
I know plenty of creatives who still use posting themselves manuscripts by registered mail as their method to prove they had a copy of some content on a specified date, staked could capture that market immediately

Well I said contact Verus Devs because, with KMD there is implicit permission to use komodod to generate new blockchains. But if someone cloned Verus repo and made a new chain out of it, it would be more like old school fork (Ex: forking BTC code to get LTC) . Anyway a little communication never hurts üòÉ

[19-Oct-18 04:42 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
open source means anyone is free to use it, the main difference is a "pure" fork (aka 'a clone') of Verus would certainly never have dPoW

[19-Oct-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I meant was that you dont need to clone te repo

[19-Oct-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can just use the binary bundled with their agama to make a runtime fork by changing the `verusd` scripts parameters, just like you do to create a komodo runtime fork.

[19-Oct-18 04:50 AM] gcharang#6833

I wonder if games on Blockchain really have a future.  I'm actually sure, but I'd like to hear your opinion.

There are a lot of games on Ethereum now.  For the games to have a future, you need scaling and trust.

[22-Oct-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
dice is always popular on blockchain and KMDICE uses the dice CC contract for a decentralized provably fair betting with every single bet validated

[22-Oct-18 09:22 AM] Seko#7408
KMDICE is the basis for infinite widths of the blockchain. The games could be so extensive and all genres could be served.
