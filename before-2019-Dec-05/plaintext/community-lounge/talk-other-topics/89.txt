Dirty BTC coins on the XMR market?
This both serves as a buyer beware and a need for advice.  TLDR: I sold XMR for BTC on bisq, transferred it to 2 different exchanges and both accounts independently got locked in the past 2 months.  Before I hear that I should stay away from exchanges, I know, I know already....

Versions of handlebars prior to 4.0.14 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. Templates may alter an Objects' prototype, thus allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server

This is why SwiftUI will raise the bar for apps. 

If you can iterate on the interface in code and instantly see the results, you can move much faster.

Investment is a choice of individual tastes and beliefs and sensibilities and risks. bitcoin, however, is a holistic system that dedicates collective learning. public learning is slow but steady; but it is part of the system because the public misunderstands and the misunderstanding is reflected in the price. thus, as long as the public perceives the current situation as a lookout, bitcoin is unstable. 

the world is not logical, non-mathematical and inaccurate. complex, unpredictable, and unstable. we need to create a blockchain optimized for such a world. one should not be a dreamer who falls into ideology and is out of touch with reality. 

I am awed by Satoshi Nakamoto, who agonized over the reality and suggested solutions. 

satoshi created the strongest system in the world.

First step is to design the specs of the transmitters,  basically the magnifying transmitter was 2 Tesla coils driving a third , so 12 cores need wound  ,  but need to research and math it up on which frequencies to use for the amount of turns per core and the dimensions of the capacitive toroid.   After this current agama situation gets dealt with I definitely want to talk to you more if your into this sort of thing.

There would be never a good time to joke about people losing funds especially when you run a competing wallet too. This will come back to bite you in the ass if and when your wallet gets hacked especially since the code is not open source.

Our system detected a disk failure and gracefully shut down to prevent any data loss or corruption.
Will update regularly on our progress during the maintenance.

_never understood why a glorified web-page is so twisted and needlessly complex anyway ü§∑üèΩ_

If the hack was initiated by the discovery of the vulnerability, I wonder how many other vulnerabilities are currently being exploited unbeknownst to their respective devs? I would hope most projects are have been auditing their systems . maybe binance found something that initiated their own nightmare scenario.
