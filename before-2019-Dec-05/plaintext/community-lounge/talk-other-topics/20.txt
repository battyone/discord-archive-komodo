He was heavily inspired by Alex Grey. A friend got to also work with Alex Grey at the eclipse festival in Oregon last year. Coincidentally she also went crazy shortly thereafter.

@Hegelian I think you do this when installing fresh OS. There are tutorial you can google.

[25-Sep-18 06:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
osx allows you to encrypt your hard drives from disk utility. still be careful, have backup and follow some tutorial online for osx

[25-Sep-18 06:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for linux, ubuntu allows you to make an encrypted partition(s) to install OS on, that will require you to put that disk decryption password at boot time

Cotinuing from general üòõ how do you explain visualisation for things out of your control? I remember reading quite a few people talking about how they tested the whole Sigil visualisation magick rituals and how they tested it with things like ‚Äúseeing a man dressed as a woman in a green skirt holding balloons‚Äù or really out there things which aren‚Äôt impossible but very unlikely and would remind you of the visualisation you did a while back

[25-Sep-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
If visualising goals helps you realise them that makes enough sense, but I don‚Äôt really understand the part where it‚Äôs out of your control of how visualisation can work (if it does)

[25-Sep-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you assume it is out of your control?

[25-Sep-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
a strong enough visualization will start resonating

[25-Sep-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
all it takes is one man who resonates with it and decides to wear a green skirt while holding balloons

[25-Sep-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810

Interesting. Do you have any thoughts on sigils? If you‚Äôve heard of them üòÇ it‚Äôs some low level magic (though many argue it‚Äôs not considered magic at all) it‚Äôs visualiIng your goals, say ‚ÄúI am happy‚Äù and the main method people use is to write it down with no vowels so MHPPY, then be as creative as you want in making some symbol with it so (no rules be as open creative as you want) so it‚Äôs something you can subconsciously visualise, and has meaning to it. Then you focus all your mental energy into it for a few seconds (the quick n dirty method people use is the good ol üçÜüí¶ while imagining the symbol which has no meaning to anyone but you. Then you destroy the symbol and forget about it

[25-Sep-18 10:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
That‚Äôs some ‚Äòmagic‚Äô way of visualisation which is pretty much the same as law of attraction etc, just with a drawn out path and method people can follow and believe in stronger

EOS problem is much much much more power in the 21 block producers and only 21 of them and KMD's 64 notarizing nodes. KMD will continue to get blocks even without any notary nodes. not sure EOS can fix their centralization problem .
