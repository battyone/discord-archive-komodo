@Aeetes havent seen any known discord members respond to the refund stuff

[23-Sep-19 02:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Should be interesting to see how it unfolds, hope everyone is made whole üôÇ

One in Discord and one in Telegram said they have received a refund. The next 24 hours will tell the tale.

[23-Sep-19 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840
@Aeetes did you get a refund?

[23-Sep-19 02:56 PM] PTYX#6840
I'd take any refund claim as a grain of salt

[23-Sep-19 02:57 PM] LocoMB#8593
surprise! K63 is still running?

[23-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if I were him I would not say anything about it untill the refund is processed

[23-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
wouldnt be surprised to see someone cancel your refund because you are 'fudding'

[23-Sep-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
anyway, I hope for those that want a refund they get it, and for those that hodl that it goes to the moon

[23-Sep-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362

I have to mention now here.. that i received my promised refund from Sam/ TP in its entirety. Some who might know... thing‚Äôs until very recently were real explosive between him and me.
But FuD aside, this is a good thing. And it should be mentioned.
Hope everyone will get as promised.

News just broke in Israel that @Kik / @kin_foundation fired its 70 employees who were building the kin ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù in Tel Aviv.

Kik raised ~$100M in an ICO.

Article also cites rumors that Kik, the instant messenger, might be shut down soon as well

It‚Äôs official! Ethereum miners have unilaterally increased the gas limit and made it even harder to sync a full node. 

Meanwhile ethereans rejoice at how easy it was for miners to do this without public debate.

guys, why do you talk like this? I don't understand.

Maybe I don't understand the situation. Do you have a small circle of friends that you want to talk to? Maybe a private chat would be a good solution, like a telegram chat or group chat.

[24-Sep-19 06:07 PM] Audo#5667
Let me repeat this again.

Komodo Discord is for people interested in building open source blockchain technology. There are people here who work 12 hours/day to build this project up. Many who contribute their free time to this.

It is a disgrace for them to read such low quality chat with no valuable content.

We will **not** create a NSFW channel or any channel for meaningless chit chat involving topics such as porn and prostitution. If you guys want to discuss such topics then find anoter community ‚Äì it has nothing to do with Komodo.

@Audo Here is a constructive comment...  You should change the description of this channel.  Right now it reads, "A channel to talk about whatever you like.  It's a free-for-all here."  That clearly is not correct based on your most recent post.

@meatspoon , let's just use common sense. The discussion was against our community guidelines that basically ask everyone to behave. 4chan type of chat is not tolerated.

[24-Sep-19 10:19 PM] Audo#5667
just to clarify what I mean I added this to the community guidelines:

That‚Äôs the funny thing about common sense, @Audo   When I read that this channel is a ‚Äúfree-for-all‚Äù and the channel is to talk about whatever the user likes, common sense tells me to take those words at face value. Then you immediately threatened a ban on 3 people in one post because their jokes weren‚Äôt the flavor that you happen to like. Just change the channel description so that it reflects the new policy of subjective moderation followed by bans.

[24-Sep-19 10:44 PM] Moderator#9338
Please keep the public discussion mature, civilised and constructive. The Komodo Team and community members are freedom of speech advocates and proponents. Nevertheless do restroom related topics and bad language have no place in here. @Caglio, @meatspoon , @Tek & Co. please respect this and move meaningless discussions to direct messages or private channels. An "off-topic" channel is for off-topic discussions and not for restroom relevant chatter or insults. Jokes are welcome as long as we keep it civilised and mature. Thank you for your understanding.

[24-Sep-19 10:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
I get it. I think we both agree that language and word choice is important. Therefor, change the description of this channel so that people are not mislead. This is certainly not a ‚Äúfree-for-all‚Äù in here. And ‚Äúcivilized and mature‚Äù is hiiiighly subjective.

If Qualcomm, IBM, Intel, and Samsung did not file patents at all since the beginning, would we live in a whole different world by now?

I don‚Äôt think so.

The only people who despise patents in blockchain are ‚Äúindividual‚Äù developers.

Companies that put capital and resources need to secure their intellectual properties.
