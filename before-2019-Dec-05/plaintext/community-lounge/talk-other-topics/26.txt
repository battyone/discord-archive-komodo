Most Americans can't even find Puerto Rico on a globe (the majority will point to Cuba or the Bahamas).

Microtik doesn't have too much competition . Makes you wonder how many companies could be compromised just in North and South America

[16-Oct-18 04:48 AM] Hermes#6934
Telecom companies don't even deal with security type of issues they just hire 3rd parties so there is a big gap of possible vectors but I always knew that it had vulnerabilities.

in the end the internet could end up divided by classes ...the ones that pay for security and the ones that don't ..

```As you may have figured out, I am not talking about businesses in Australia…but Argentina.

As reported by Ambito, an Argentinean newspaper, even with an estimated 30% salary rise by the end of the year, paycheques will have lost on average about 11.7%, as you can see in the graph below.

This is because inflation is estimated to end the year at a high 42%.```

I have a funny story about the last time I used airport... On the way to my destination the searched me for explosives, where I went we set off hundreds of fireworks, so my self and luggage was covered in explosive residues, then on the way home, they don't search me for anything and let me pass onto plane instantly.

They have been buying up good grazing land for a while

[17-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, that was what they did first... buy up all the mines and recouces making us think we were rich... .whilst sneakily taking all the best farmland from under our noses, while no one wanted to work it because there was bettter money elsewhere ... the farmers who were able to hold will clean up in the next few years.

[17-Oct-18 01:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes but the next evolution is they wait till countries fall, then offer them loans, then take land/favors as payment
