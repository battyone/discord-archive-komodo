3. The entrepreneurs who well distinguish between impossible work and not attempted work succeed.
4. Although it seems like it hasn't been tried before,  In reality, entrepreneurs who do impossible things fail.
5. Although it is seemingly impossible, In practice, entrepreneurs who do things they haven't tried succeed.
6. However, even entrepreneurs who does impossible things is sometimes lucky, and when the timing is right, this impossible task can be something they haven't tried before.
7. In conclusion, entrepreneurs who do what many say is impossible eventually achieve something with luck.

I wonder what risks does we early cryptocurrency adopters have in next 5-10 years?
does anyone thinks that some future project comes along and dominates more than bitcoin, komodo, eth?
like if some government or some big company issues their project and puts more developer efforts to it, it will be risk to value of existing cryptocurrency projects like the ones I mentioned?
like google, facebook, microsoft, and such which are already big and have much resources to develop the tech can take this space to another level.
This thought comes to me as none of these big giant tech companies are officially contributing to cryptocurrencies officially other than just trying to be an infrastructure project, being amazon/azure blockchain as a service host etc.

[29-Jul-18 09:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@grewalsatinder wouldnt we also be in the right spot as early adopters to be able to foresee the changes before the general public does?

[29-Jul-18 09:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And still be ahead of them?

[29-Jul-18 09:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's true... from long term hodl point of view I still wonder about such cases....

[29-Jul-18 09:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But I think I understand what you, basically that a company like amazon/apple/google have the resources to build their own crypto instead of adopting current infrastructure

[29-Jul-18 09:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And they have the scale and reach to make the general public adopt their version

[29-Jul-18 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
Telegram is the first test case of this

[29-Jul-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's exactly came to my mind too... telegram

[29-Jul-18 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
my prediction is that telegram will trade against BTC

[29-Jul-18 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
