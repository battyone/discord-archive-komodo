Under Netherlands law they are exempt from oversight or any licenses. However, they did have to register with the ministry to get the exemption.

Komodo’s overall goal is to provide developers with the ability to build independent and self-sovereign smart chains that avoid the reliance of single-chain blockchain platforms. As such, Komodo has in no way endorsed the Komodore64(K64) project, nor are we responsible for vetting projects that build on Komodo’s open source technology. We are deeply concerned with several seemingly false statements made by members of the K64 team regarding project investments and we strongly advise those interested in participating in their project to practice extreme caution and due diligence ahead of time.

So right before I got banned from k64 for posting right here, not even k64 discord, here's what my take on the situation was/is. 
1: the GS investment opportunity might have been real, however the agama hack caused issue with this. (There was a lot of boo hooing today mentioning the hack and issues it caused k64) GS most likely stepped away then or definitely now. ( Maybe they are still at the table, but after today....)
2. The k64 fat finger dump was most likely them trying to get some initial funding as GS was just a potential offer.
3: There was also hoops that k64 had to jump through in order to get this GS money. X amount of games had to be produced in X time frame. Basically they had to prove they were capable team. 
4. They hastely threw together an expo as a means to fool investers or to try to prove to GS they could do it.  Expo had fake games, or mockups of what could have been. 
5. They never had any code. KMD devs noticed this.
6. They kept moving offices despite not actually even making anything.
7. Didn't pay bills yet could afford first class plane tickets.
8. Took $1000 from Fishyguts for a project called warchain(never happened)
9. People quiting left right.
10. Promises get made, then excuses get made.
11. Weird shit and threats get throw around.
12. Partners, vendors, and CEOs all quit . The guy that owns the intellectual property quit, therefore they start over. Coincidentally he was also the guy to handle the buyback. The new guy that is supposed to handle the buyback, also just quit.
13. Full blown dumpster fire confirmed.

Organised scammer teams are bad for crypto because they turn otherwise 'good faith' investors into 'scam hunters' (aka false-positive paranoia).  The money that got siphoned out of the ecosystem will never be put to the use it was intended for:  advancing civilisation. Finally, it props up the faulty idea that greasy 'experts' and 'regulators' can replace DYOR.

If Apple and Goldman Sachs want to see the game as a stablecoin, there is little differentiation compared to JPM Coin and Facebook's Libra, which have already been released by their competitors. Rather, it might be better to bet on bitcoin like Microsoft or Twitter-Square. I'm very curious about what kind of card Apple and Goldman Sachs will take out."

3% of dgb is another $300k. So binance want $600k for listing. Unbelievable. Don't they realize that if they don't want to list something, it's better say that sorry we don't want to list your coin, than make an offer that feels like extortion.
