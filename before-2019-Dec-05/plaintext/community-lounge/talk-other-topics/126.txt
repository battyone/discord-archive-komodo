[12-Oct-19 06:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
the revolving doors between govt agencies like the SEC and investment banks like Goldman are so well known that it is common knowledge at this point. The fact that the SEC still has any credibility at all is a testament to how gullible the American investor has become.

[12-Oct-19 06:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
Crypto got the hole-shot in 2017 and raced ahead of pretty much anything else in recorded human history, investment return wise. Now govt's everywhere are doing everything legally and extra-legally possible to crush what the fear will eventually bring an end to their "value exchange" hegemony. We only lose if we give up the fight against their over-reach.

Who here lives in a police state? Raise your ‚úã.  Violence against the cops and their military gear is pretty dumb. Changes nothing. Gets you hurt. Gets them bigger budgets. Only power you have is what you put in your body and how you spend your money. Real change comes from disruptive technology. Take away their toys and they have no power left. DEX, 3d printers, open sourcesoftware, torrents, growing own food, etc. Violence is unnecessary, you hear that you antifa assholes

I really appreciate that FB is fighting this fight, regardless of their dystopian motivations. We now have sitting US Senators sending warning letters threatening to use their enforcement lapdogs against anyone who runs anything crypto related. What a show! Everyone can now see how dearly those in power regard their control of OUR money. Those senators need to lose their seats next election.

[14-Oct-19 03:28 PM] joe2x4#5987
It's still unknown to me why the government mafias make claims that the technology known as money is theirs alone. And if you dare use it, you owe them a piece. Maybe use of money without mafia protection payments should be a human right.

[14-Oct-19 03:30 PM] joe2x4#5987
In regards to senators and losing their seats, current system breeds the same type of corrupt person, better would be to make them obsolete.

We are at about 6 months before May 2020 #bitcoin halving. 

In 2012 btc jumped from $5 to $12 (2.3x) in those 6 months before the halving. In 2016 btc jumped from $350 to $650 (1.7x).

Decentralization is only a means towards the key to blockchain value, trust minimization, which brings a host of benefits: immutability, censorship resistance, global seamlessness, monetary and financial sovereignty.  Other kinds of decentralization are security theater.

does anyone deal with domains? I grabbed these at .dev release but I didn't use them. I want to sell them but I don't know how, except listing on some random sites which is not a good way I guess

domain brokers? I don't know if it would worth it though

sometimes you get lucky and can pickup a good domain

[17-Oct-19 09:07 AM] ca333#0118
https://sedo.com is a good place to sell domains - domain brokers always keep an eye on it - as i can see you ve bought them on namecheap - so you can set a selling price on there and then just try advertising them on various boards, etc. @naezith

Bitcoin is not for criminals.
Anonymous coins are for criminals. 

Cypherpunks and anarchists don‚Äôt understand that privacy is not anonymity, and observation is not surveillance.

whether you have some criminal shit to hide or not

privacy is a basic right, not something we have to demand from the govt

@designer `Anonymous coins are for criminals.` false. they are for people that value their personal lives and don't want some big data company "recommending" products before they even know they "need" it
people living in oppressive countries/situations might also take interest (i.e. HK atm's no longer dispense enough cash to buy a popsicle)

[17-Oct-19 01:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
there is a difference between privacy and anonymity, however in the digital age we live in you can't really have one without the other. nowadays having privacy is no longer enough.

[17-Oct-19 01:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
and i defer you to the work of cambridge analytica - even if you were pseudonymous (somewhat private) a profile could still be built based on your connections (friends, photos, etc.) - the same can not be achieved if you are anonymous and therefore your private life remains private
