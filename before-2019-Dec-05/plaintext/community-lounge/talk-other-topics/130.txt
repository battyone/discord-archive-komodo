A wealthy person gifts you $10,000. You get to choose in which form you‚Äôll accept the gift. 

But there‚Äôs a catch: You must keep the gift in the form that you choose for 10 years without touching it. 

In which form would you accept the gift?

Coinbase is sharing information about your account with third parties, which may include information such as: how often you open the app, which devices you open it from, and what the IP address of those devices is. Absolutely unacceptable behavior.

[11-Nov-19 12:46 PM] joe2x4#5987
```Two weeks ago, Komodore64 employees therefore filed for bankruptcy with their employer. Around the same time the rumor surfaced that Sam N. was arrested at the Hilton Hotel in The Hague, where he had been staying for some time because he felt threatened by angry crypto investors.

Interrogate
Whether the arrest actually took place at that hotel is not yet clear. In the meantime it has been established that the entrepreneur was recently arrested and will be questioned on Tuesday, the curator of Komodore64 John Dullaart confirms to Sprout. According to him, it is not yet 100 percent certain that the arrest has to do with the bankruptcy of Komodore64, but it obviously has the appearance.```

Seems like hearsay from the article

[11-Nov-19 08:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
> Wel staat inmiddels vast dat de ondernemer kort geleden is gearresteerd en dinsdag zal worden verhoord, bevestigt de curator van Komodore64 John Dullaart aan Sprout. Het staat volgens hem nog niet 100 procent vast dat de arrestatie te maken heeft met het faillissement van Komodore64, maar daar heeft het uiteraard alle schijn van.

[11-Nov-19 08:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Means, it is confirmed that Sam is arrested. It is confirmed by the curator, john dullaart to sprout.

Although it is not 100% confirmed that the arrest is linked to the bankruptcy, but it seems highly likely

`Various investors had made investments with the startup‚Äôs crypto coin, where they raised up to 78 million Euros in growth capital in July.` and this is how "good" journalism trumps facts ü§¶

```a possible restart of Komodore64 will also come into the picture.```

some miracle would have to be performed for someone from this community to touch anything with that name again

Everyone loves a redemption story. And bad press = good press type of thing . I've seen weirder things, like a skinny Mark Karpeles

Unfortunately Anna Larsen made a disturbing mistake when translating the original Dutch article. Max Theyse was never listed as co-founder, but an unnamed person, with whom the curator has spoken. This co-founder was passed over and Max N. is believed to have presented M. Theyse as co-founder despite the fact he wasn‚Äôt.

Hmm meyse no longer in this server otherwise we could ask him üôÇ
