The look of the White House Italian translator as Trump says President Mozzarella for the Italian President and says U.S. and Italy have been allies since Ancient Rome. Hot fucking damn

50+ unread messages in most channels, which I have already seen

@jorian its when a spammer posts something which gets deleted I think

[18-Oct-19 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
no, not that, it's setting stuff that i already read as unread again

[18-Oct-19 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
pretty much all channels

[18-Oct-19 10:01 AM] PHBA2061#2530
that's what gcharang said, same thing happened to me, may be an issue on Discord side

[18-Oct-19 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
Same happened to me as well. A lot of read messages in many channels showing as unread.

[18-Oct-19 10:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As I said, if a spammer posts something, which after that gets deleted, it still shows the channel as unread even though the last message before the spammer was read

[18-Oct-19 10:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if that makes sense?

[18-Oct-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is it. also if somebody adds or clicks on an emoji

[18-Oct-19 10:10 AM] gcharang#6833
it showed something like this for all channels, where I had already seen the messages

normally, when a spammer post is deleted, it won't show the 50+ message at the top of the screen

got scammed twice  by the ecosystem projects so far now

[18-Oct-19 10:36 AM] SHossain#0007
So, Komodo team was right to put out warnings and asked users to DYOR before investing. That was a great thing. While it saved many users, some went against that ANN and been asking why Komodo done it.
Did Komodo team do the right thing?
My personal opinion, YES.
I lost some funds on this scam too.

His manic exitement early on in Discord had me wary, was waiting to see tech equal hype. Never got there. Shooting for the moon while rocket is just a pretty picture can become a harsh fall back to earth.  
KMD announcing ecosys projects is neighborly, but noone know what goes on behind closed doors across the road and good faith was abused. As time went on, there were enough red flags for KMD to not only withdraw support but to go as far as to publicly issue a warning.

[18-Oct-19 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
I don't think KMD withdraw any support actually. jl777 was still willing to train their devs. K64 still being notarized.

there will always be scammers

[18-Oct-19 11:40 AM] SHossain#0007
ETH is very large ecosystem compared to Komodo. I don't think they can handle all those scam alerts easily. While Komodo is not too small, they did warn users to be safe. Which actually helped a lot of users from getting scammed. Otherwise, many more users would be investing on that scam. It was too good to be true.

[18-Oct-19 11:41 AM] SHossain#0007
You are right @jorian. There will always be scammers.

[18-Oct-19 11:43 AM] jorian#4555
i'm hoping you're not saying that if komodo never warns, people blindly buy into scams? so that if a project turns into a scam after all, komodo is to blame because they didn't warn?

[18-Oct-19 11:43 AM] jorian#4555
aka, we need our good protector KMD?

[18-Oct-19 11:44 AM] jorian#4555
people just need to do their own research and not depend on things anyone else says

as for the discord channels something happened on their side, seems everyone experienced that

[18-Oct-19 04:31 PM] grumpygoron#4320
People who supported K64 through all the clear warning signs honestly have no sympathy from me.  They were hostile about it and it really led to chaos in the discord who meant well in warning them of a scam and didn‚Äôt want to listen to the bullshit lies they were perpetuating
