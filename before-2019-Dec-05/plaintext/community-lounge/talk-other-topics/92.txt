Seems like competition always get bought out or litigated/propagandized into oblivion by the corporate cartel. I'm no elon musk fanboy but everytime a tesla fatally crashes or catches on fire its sensationalized everywhere. It's almost as if every other manufacturers' cars dont do the exact same in thousands of instances every day.

@CHMEX It's entirely Google's fault that CCN relies entirely on Google as their way to be seen and known about!
It's not like they've been running for 6 years and have had the chance to build up a loyal user-base and other means of communication; Google is the only way to advertise on the interwebz.

​​Zcash operator hit with $2 mln lawsuit due to unpaid stocks to ex-employee

According to court documents filed May 29, the parent company behind Zcash, is facing a $2 million lawsuit over unpaid shares.

The Superior Court of California in San Francisco received the complaint from ex-employee, Simon Liu. Liu brought forward the charges after he didnt recieve $15,000 worth of stock in 2016. Simon Liu is reported to have worked for Zerocoin in the past, which now is known as the Electric Coin Company.

Liu, claims the company was not legally permitted to offer the equity and as quoted from the court documents:

“Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Zerocoin did not have the authorization to issue common stock to employees in 2016, and that Defendants, and each of them, were aware that Zerocoin did not have such an authorization.”

Liu also claims that any requests to view company documents were denied. At this time Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Zerocoin, or anybody in the company has yet to comment on these matters.

@Malti  I propose that a KMD and KMD asset mining facility based in Malta running on wave generated electricity is built. Estimated cost: 500,000 - 1,000,000 KMD. If the project is funded, it gets build. If it doesn't get funded the KMD is returned to KMD hodlers.

[13-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Malti#3948

[13-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Malti#3948
Probably also external investors?

Malta, I suppose for the friendly crypto govt?

[13-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Malti @Cryptoon I could be underestimating, but depending on size I think 1,000,000 KMD would get us in the game for sure.

[13-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Malti#3948
I would focus on institutional investors first for that Idea (green energy companies)

[13-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Malti#3948
but it's something to further think about tbh, i like it

[13-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Malti It's a game-changer technology with positive environmental impact... Perhaps the proceeds from the mining operation could also be used to fund further innovative projects world-wide, decided by investor committee?

[13-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Malti#3948
agreed, but 1 mio isn't gonna cut it imo

[13-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Malti how big do you want to scale?

[13-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
i'm not a miner so it's difficult to say, but to make it profitable i'd say that you need a pretty big facility

[13-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Malti  my thinking is it might  be better to start small and build once pre-conditions are established?

[13-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Malti#3948
if you say start small, then i'd start with powering my laptop with the current stream behind my appartment :p

[13-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Malti 1,00,000 KMD for a bridgehead ... the rest could come from the proceeds or additional fundraising. 😉

[13-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Lumbi#8378
anyway a rather 'ambitious idea' ... any feedback is welcome.

```Monero’s Secret ASICs

A few months ago, it was publicly exposed that ASICs had been developed in secret to mine Monero. My sources say that they had been mining on these secret ASICs since early 2017, and got almost a full year of secret mining in before discovery. The ROI on those secret ASICs was massive, and gave the group more than enough money to try again with other ASIC resistant coins.

It’s estimated that Monero’s secret ASICs made up more than 50% of the hashrate for almost a full year before discovery, and during that time, nobody noticed. During that time, a huge fraction of the Monero issuance was centralizing into the hands of a small group, and a 51% attack could have been executed at any time.```
