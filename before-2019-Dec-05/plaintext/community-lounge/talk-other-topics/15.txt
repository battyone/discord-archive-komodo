I feel a stake weighted approach is more secure than web of trust, which I dont see how can be protected fully from sybil attacks

I'm the one who thinks China's economy and society are going to have a big crack. 
than when a social rift leads to an economic rift, economic cracks more often lead to social cracks. 
the problem is the timing, perhaps five years later, when look back at the world, I think people will nod and understand.

If about 150 of the 1000 global enterprises are Chinese enterprises, half of them are state-owned enterprises. 
I think half of them should already have been bankrupt. 
this distorted market structure and the existence of authoritarian dictatorship is a serious threat to us.

I think that the maximum amount that civilization can reach is in places where freedom coexists with order. usually, emphasis of order restrains freedom, and granting of liberty leads to disorder. United States has a lot of energy of free and Japan has a lot of energy of order. there is a fear of freedom and disorder in China.

many people are amazed at the rise of China, but I think China's heyday is over. from now on, the next twenty years will see the collapse of the Chinese economy, and we will see the body of the Chinese Communist Party in crisis. many of the international economic phenomena will be by-products.

@Deleted User yes, China can't move forward unless it collapses. collapse of the communist regime is essential for future leap forward, and the collapse of the communist regime means considerable confusion. whether can get over the turmoil and move forward is real ability of China.

@Deleted User  @designer  I read somewhere that it's not about socialism, but more about corruption in China. When there is corruption you do not place intelligent and/or experienced people as important leaders of companies, cities and so on... you choose your family and friends. And they make stupid decisions. One of such is wrong investments, like building part of a city with trains, supermarkets, new houses ready for use by 100k people.... where nobody lives. Corruption (inside country) is not effectively spent money. Waste. This waste can be handled when economy is fine. When it is not fine - people will start noticing it more and more.

economic crises over the last 30years have revealed that the rapid growth of the economy, which is not supported by the level of consciousness and democracy in the economic development stage, ends with hard-landing. we are just waiting for time to confirm the principle again in China. (there are hopes for young people in China, but it will take a very long time.)

If the linked Xinhua report is correct, it is highly likely that the regulation that limited the term of Chinese President and his successor to a consecutive term will disappear. I think China will open up Xi Jinping's long-term rule and enter the hard-landing path at the same time. http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/25/c_136998770.htm

expect to experience hard landing by the end of 2019. It will be Japanese economy that sees the most profit in this situation.

Part of it is coinbase batching transactions as well, but yea kind of weird conclusion üòÉ

[23-Aug-18 11:35 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this conclusion comes from believing that december/january volume was a deliberate "spam" attack instead of natural usage for the bubble

[23-Aug-18 11:37 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the probable outcome is that, at every bubble, BTC will hit the same ceiling and more users will switch to other coins
