still got obamacare, but in many areas there is only one health insurer so you go on the welfare care or you pay the piper. welfare care means you get no choice in doctors or hospitals.

I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.

I went to an Ethereum hackathon today and the scalability/security issues + dissonance between developers is quite remarkable

Another fun fact... JP Morgan launched their first Ethereum-based chain years ago as ‚ÄúQuorum‚Äù

Never knew!

[09-Mar-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
dissonance between which devs?

[09-Mar-19 08:32 PM] ErikB#3019
I prefer not to single anyone out here, but as I moved around the space and spoke to several people, I discovered that there are basically 2 camps, 1.0-minded and 2.0-minded devs

And when I say 1.0 vs 2.0, I mean to say that there was no consensus as to how Ethereum could properly scale and remain secure

[09-Mar-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
probably due to it not being possible

[09-Mar-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
or at least so complex as to not be practical

[09-Mar-19 08:36 PM] ErikB#3019
There are also a bunch of unrelated protocols/networks sponsoring the event... 

Probably a sign as well^

[09-Mar-19 09:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
Imo Ethereum has a superiority complex due to their first mover advantage. If it‚Äôs not solidity it‚Äôs of no interest to many eth devs. Oracles only exist on the eth network, and on and on ad nauseam.

PSA: Neutrino (BIP 157 block filtering protocol) VS. Neutrino (Coinbase acquired hacking team company)

There is an [open PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14121) to merge the [BIP 157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki) aka [Neutrino light client block filter protocol](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/neutrino-privacy-preserving-light-wallet-protocol/)

tldr; Neutrino block filtering protocol will allow mobile non-custodial LN wallets to exist because it can shrink the disk space required to fully validate on-chain tx to only 3.8 GB which can sync to the tip of the blockchain in under an hour! This is means even years old mobile phones can easily handle client side verification. **This is VERY GOOD.**

Do not get it confused with the Neutrino Company coinbase recently acquired and the whole hacking team fiasco.

**The important Neutrino to remember is BIP 157 neutrino.**

The Bitcoin daily transaction count dropped by 42% in the last 10 days. The timing coincides with the end of Veriblock's testnet on March 4. While still in testnet, Veriblock captured anywhere from 25-45% of Bitcoin's transactions.

Si, probabilmente √® inguardabile. Magari pieno di clich√©. Ma ehy, sai quanti meme ci possiamo tirare fuori da qui?

"Yes, it is probably unwatchable. Maybe full of clich√©s. But ehi, you know how many memes we can get out of it?"

the AML compliance officer is the cool, swarthy protagonist and the bad guys are using a (gasp) anonymous cryptocurrency wallet. Just your garden variety hollywood govt contract propaganda.

what about the women and children? who will protect them?

[13-Mar-19 02:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the government always has your best interest at heart ofcourse

[13-Mar-19 02:26 PM] PTYX#6840
women don't need protection anymore. soon children won't either :troll:

@Deleted User the comment section of that thread is gold. bsv fans and managers are probably in crisis mode.

The real crypto movie: a bunch of guys sitting in front of their computers a couple carbonated drinks around maybe a bag of Cheetos , just waiting for the chain to sync

[13-Mar-19 02:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seriously though who in their right mind puts an AML compliance officer as the protagonist of a movie

[13-Mar-19 08:12 PM] joe2x4#5987
Drugs. Lots of drugs. If you're not on the newest FDA approved miracle cure (warning might cause anal bleeding, memory loss, or death) then you just might be hopped up on MDMA/ectasy/Molly or too much Burningman LSD and DMT to the head . I've heard horror stories from San Fran hedenistic "love" fest, taxis cover their seats with saranwrap. Bay Area thought leaders LOVE drugs. It's as simple as that.

$TOTAL CRYPTO MC 

I just thought that I would revisit these for some perspective

$TOTAL showing MC has responded to previous historical support areas

Zoomed in from August 2018 shows MC is just ranging, as we have done previous

Perspective. Don't be mislead by CT rheto...
