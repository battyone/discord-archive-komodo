even now my mind attempts to project a vector of allignment or acclimation of a scene, assoiciated from the sensory inputs my brain is receiving, yet this is a perspective that changes in time persuaded by the environment and my choice. Perceptual adversaries appear to everyone, these imo are not problems, they are a chance to find out more information about the system.

It is quite different to tell the truth and to say socially acceptable words. Social conventional wisdom sometimes not makes the truth out of the mouth. because safer to be included in a group that follows the spirit of the times, right or wrong.

what about Nick Szabo ? He denied it but he could be Satoshi right ?

[24-Apr-19 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Given that people are looking for a "solution" to the "problem" of tx fees driving the chain as blck rewards reduce (something by design and stated in the wp), it's safe to say that whoever it is isn't active....

Kleiman's story is compelling

[24-Apr-19 09:43 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Szabo isn't possible, too different views from Satoshi.  I read many believing it was Finney and his death matches with the disappereance of Satoshi . Then there's the Scronty-Kleiman-Wright story that is plausible too but not provable

[24-Apr-19 10:00 PM] PTYX#6840
Didn't Szabo's text match almost identically to the white paper though? He must have had a role in the beginning.

[24-Apr-19 10:00 PM] PTYX#6840
Who blames him for saying he didn't though. Only Craig wants that type of attention.

[24-Apr-19 10:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I mean Szabo designed Bit-Gold and he has always advanced the 2-layers solution that is now on Bitcoin roadmap, but Satoshi never had similar views. They seem completely at odds.

Is Craig Wright #Satoshi or #Faketoshi?

According to @_Phil_Wilson_ the answer isn't that simple. Satoshi was comprised of three people, one of which was Craig.
