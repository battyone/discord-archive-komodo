We keep witnessing people going crazy because the system is crazy  I firmly believe that government needs to be updated. I think that smart contracts or in our case crypto conditions can eliminate alot of waste, mismanagement, bad decisions, political nonsense and hopefully lead to a better society. These excerpts are taken from a Martin Armstrong article but are great points that could be adapted towards a block chain integrated democracy. A crypto condition Congress if you will.

[15-Mar-19 04:39 PM] joe2x4#5987
```The first criteria are¬†TERM LIMITS¬†and the elimination of any power to borrow. No spending bill may be merged with another. Every bill must stand on its own and the people must vote by a computer on each bill. They cannot be passed without more than 50% of the people voting. Therefore, we restore a¬†DIRECT¬†form of Democratic government.```

[15-Mar-19 04:40 PM] joe2x4#5987
```There may be no law that is based upon any religious belief or seeks to impose any restriction upon any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Some people will object. But we must understand that we have to protect even people we disagree with in order to protect ourselves. There can be no exception to basic rights.¬†Arnaud Amalric,¬†prior to the massacre at B√©ziers, was reported to have said: ‚ÄúNovit enim¬†Dominus¬†qui sunt eius,‚Äù which is a direct translation of the Latin phrase¬†‚ÄúKill them. For the Lord knows those that are His own.‚Äù¬†It is not our station to sit in judgment over others pretending to know what God wants. That is his role, not ours. Laws should never be allowed to be written for the purpose of forcing the belief of one group upon another as we have today with the left v right.```

[15-Mar-19 04:41 PM] joe2x4#5987
```Next, we must eliminate all forms of¬†Direct Taxation¬†(income tax), which requires people to report to the government even to confirm you are not rich. All taxation¬†MUST¬†be indirect as the Founding Fathers intended. The people will pay taxes based upon their consumption. Naturally, raw food and rent should be exempt. Then you cap the government expenditure at a max of 5% of GDP, not to exceed the population growth rate.```

[15-Mar-19 04:42 PM] joe2x4#5987
```Money is simply the medium of exchange. It is¬†NEVER¬†a reservoir or store of wealth. It is merely the unit of account that is no different from a language. If someone says something to you in German, you immediately try to translate it to your native tongue to understand what they said. Money serves the same function. We call Trump¬†a billionaire, not because he has cash in the bank, but because people look at his assets and translate them into money to judge his worth. That is the role of money. We must understand and embrace it. Only then can we comprehend a monetary system.```

[15-Mar-19 04:43 PM] joe2x4#5987
```These are just a few of the necessary elements. The crisis is¬†NEVER¬†the quantity of money. It is those who seek to rule us from above. Direct reform at the powers that be and the monetary system will quickly fall into line. There is no possible ‚Äúperpetual prosperity‚Äù because everything is connected and nature also plays a role in the business cycle. Marx to Keynes have all tried to create the perfect system that will produce endless prosperity. That is an impossible fictional dream.```

I just wanna say that during days like today where mass surveillance and big gov dominate, and yet we still can‚Äôt seem to stop the hate or the murder of innocent human beings, we really ought to reconsider our reaction after what took place in NZ.

If they rob us of our right to privacy, and can‚Äôt even guarantee our safety after the multitude of possibilities to uncover information/intervene, they certainly don‚Äôt deserve to govern.

And by ‚Äúthey‚Äù I mean whoever the puppet masters may be.

New post on offtopic üòõ 
*Airdrop* **arrrrdrop**

For the fellow Komodians and Pirates in this channel, I am offering an airdrop of OUR tokens (OCryptoUnion)
OCU has rececntly acquired ZADDEX/ZEX  and we are well on the way of opening fiat gateways for komodo ecosystem coins as well as other projects.

OCU are focusing on Crypto to Fiat loans, traditional banking instruments, launchpad and VC with startup companies in Ivory coast (exclusive partnership with their largest SME and government) as well as many other aspects.

Due to the overwhelming amount of newcomers, I will need to constantly change the airdrop amount, but as of now can offer 2000 OUR tokens to anyone who wishes to join the discord üòÉ 

Active komodo devs/community support members will receive a bonus, as a thanks for working so hard on our favourite platform!

Can the glass transafer part of this  be used to create a truly offline laptop for coldstorage?

The way I think it can work:
- Buy a good laptop like a thinkpad
- Install a linux variant OS from a trusted source
- Download a crypto wallet that supports offline creation of keys and signing transactions 
- Physically remove Wifi adaptor, Ethernet , USB ports
- leave the camera as the only available input source
- Use through glass transfer to transfer the transaction data from online device to this offline device, sign it
- use the same thing to transfer the signed transaction back to the online device and publish it.
- this way there is no reason to worry about hardware wallets upgrading software in time or supporting whatever your favorite  Crypto coin/token we like

https://www.ccn.com/sleeping-with-the-enemy-why-institutional-adoption-is-bad-for-bitcoin
Deleting unfavourable comments from a crypto subreddit isn‚Äôt all that surprising, especially given how much rabid coin holders want to protect their investments. But there‚Äôs ample evidence to suggest that the rampant censorship on r/bitcoin began only when the institutions arrived.

Those institutions are the financial backers behind Bitcoin‚Äôs leading development group ‚Äì Blockstream. They include AXA Venture Partners, an investment wing of AXA Group ‚Äì the second largest financial services firm in the world. Blockstream has helped guide the development of Bitcoin since 2016, and if you didn‚Äôt already know that, then it may be because the Overton window has been set up specifically so that you don‚Äôt.

whats wrong with 16yr olds voting?

[18-Mar-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
likely will end up with similar result

[18-Mar-19 07:31 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think age of voting should be based on a test, like the driving license but independent of age. Quiz on basic economics, consitution and history

[18-Mar-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
then only 1% would vote and it would be so unfair to require actual knowledge to vote!
