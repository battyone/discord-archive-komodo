his Internet is worse?

[25-Jun-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
Something to do with mining a bunch of blocks while there is a pending notarization

[25-Jun-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
but the purpose of testing it was to see if it rewound properly

[25-Jun-18 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the notary should be like every 20 or 30 blocks, no?

[25-Jun-18 06:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really

[25-Jun-18 06:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the freq is 2 blocks per AC but 10 blocks of KMD

[25-Jun-18 06:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that assumes every notarizations happens... and that doesnt happen every time... its a lot better than it was i the past but stil not 100% perfect

[25-Jun-18 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It can't be every 2 blocks (going by my SN numbers)

[25-Jun-18 06:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... each AC gets a notarixzation every 2 blocks of its chain but only if 10 KMD blocks have passed.

[25-Jun-18 06:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If KMD is in f4a and no blocks are mined for 25mins... then SN can have a shit load of blocks before a Notarixztion

[25-Jun-18 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, like I said, 20-30 üòõ

[25-Jun-18 06:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if your mining it that fast yes

[25-Jun-18 06:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
btw if your minign AC can you please add my node

[25-Jun-18 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not on-demand = ~ a block per minute average

[25-Jun-18 06:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
103.6.12.112

[25-Jun-18 06:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless your trying to fork.... lol then dont haha

[25-Jun-18 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol I wasn't "trying to"; it spun up to the full 16k faster than I expected

[25-Jun-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[25-Jun-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i was joking

[25-Jun-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, either it didn't fork or someone followed and mined the fork (consolidation payment just got confirmed)

[25-Jun-18 06:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well KMD is in f4a so notarizations are not really working.. thats when I do updates etc... even if it is 2:30 am here

[25-Jun-18 06:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
how lazy am I that I never even know when the f4a is üòõ

[25-Jun-18 06:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
one of these days, I'll probably do the smart thing and mine something else and buy KMD

[25-Jun-18 06:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[25-Jun-18 06:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with your hash power, you might be able to mine the entire f4a, with an auto statum... might help KMD out too, still se 20-30mins blocks in it. Miners dont mine, until diff drops lots then hit it ahrd and mine all the 64 blocks super fast.

[25-Jun-18 06:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
all my KMD miners are 24/7 KMD

[25-Jun-18 06:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... thats prolly best way to go with the new algo for NN... f4a should be shelved as soon as its possible, likely next year at hard fork though üò¶

[25-Jun-18 06:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nearly 15mins for a block rn...

[25-Jun-18 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
irony is that I normally get more during the NN 33hrs than I do during the f4a

{Reactions}
üëè 

[25-Jun-18 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
last f4a, I got 1 block üòñ

[25-Jun-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
looks like I got 3 so far this time

[25-Jun-18 06:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all I need it this next one lol... man its getting late

[25-Jun-18 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
with the market how it is, I wouldn't mind one of those magic blocks right about now

[25-Jun-18 06:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha.. biggest one here is 13 üò¶

[25-Jun-18 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I hit 1 for 1500, but most of them that I've hit were like 4-7

[25-Jun-18 06:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
4, 7 and 13 I think here so far.

[25-Jun-18 06:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
most of mine have bee like 6

[25-Jun-18 06:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it isn't mega, but I'll never complain about a 2fer

üëç 

[25-Jun-18 06:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
got over 1800KMD first month of NN, this month lucky to make 1500, but the long block issue outside of f4a is gone, so its worth it.

[25-Jun-18 06:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and theres more for you

[25-Jun-18 06:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[25-Jun-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbt, this month SN is paying my bills üò¶

[25-Jun-18 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no joy üò¶

[25-Jun-18 07:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol sorry we got a block... afte 30mins had to attend to something

[25-Jun-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[25-Jun-18 07:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lucky I bothered to stay here talking to you and didnt just go to bed, as I left PATH out of my cron tab and nothing was working lol

[25-Jun-18 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
been there

[25-Jun-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
one cracks and they all fall like dominoes

[25-Jun-18 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
looks like RXuFayVXUyKLu9d8tDwfHMnecmSPNrpAJJ came late to the party with a rental üòõ

[25-Jun-18 07:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[25-Jun-18 07:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the notarizations even on my node went insane... when the blocks started flowing

[25-Jun-18 07:46 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I just plugged in the z9 and it sounded like a rocket ship taking off hah

[25-Jun-18 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I take it you have no S9s?

[25-Jun-18 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
double the fans and that's 1 S9 üòõ

[25-Jun-18 07:53 PM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie u did you pulled my miner off on a fork of DEX again? I am mostly the only one who keeps a GPU on it (since you left, that is)

[25-Jun-18 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
wasn't me, I almost never touch DEX

[25-Jun-18 07:55 PM] jansako#3330
thought it was you pushed that 10ksol on it

[25-Jun-18 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think I maybe mined it for 1 day :/

[25-Jun-18 07:56 PM] jansako#3330
hmm... someone has a lot of hash to throw around . Oh well, not sure what they expect to get, it has been like 0.1/day or less for a while

[25-Jun-18 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, for ~5k people, 10-16k fits in your hand üòõ

[25-Jun-18 07:58 PM] jansako#3330
no idea what that means... time to go to bed I think. Later!

[25-Jun-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the z9 minis are, literally, mini

[25-Jun-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
~ 1/2 the size of an S7 or S9

[25-Jun-18 07:59 PM] jansako#3330

pool mining ü§¶

[25-Jun-18 08:01 PM] jansako#3330
just testing. did not even settle for an algo yet

[25-Jun-18 08:02 PM] jansako#3330
I might set up my own stratum, once I settle on a coin. Would it really make that much difference with just one z9?

[25-Jun-18 08:03 PM] jansako#3330
yes, I did settle for an algo, of course... I meant coin

[25-Jun-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
aside from variance, all mining in a pool does for you is give you:
(pool mining) = (your profits) - (coinage you give away)

[25-Jun-18 08:05 PM] jansako#3330
I save the cost of time spent on setting up the stratum, and the cost of VPS...

[25-Jun-18 08:05 PM] jansako#3330
is that worth the 1% fee?

[25-Jun-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
fek a VPS, take 40 minutes and set up a local virtual machine

[25-Jun-18 08:06 PM] jansako#3330
that still costs in power

[25-Jun-18 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you believe in a coin, you should already be running a full node for that coin anyway

[25-Jun-18 08:07 PM] jansako#3330
I have too many irons in the fire for that. Or maybe not enough free computers.

[25-Jun-18 08:07 PM] jansako#3330
I see what you saying though.

[25-Jun-18 08:08 PM] jansako#3330
I do run at least 1-2 instances of KMD + a bunch of assetchains at all times.

[25-Jun-18 08:08 PM] jansako#3330
on a VPS üòÉ won;t touch it now that it is finally running well

[25-Jun-18 08:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so you're talking an extra 12 cents a year for the stratum and vm üôÑ

[25-Jun-18 08:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
why would you bother with a vps?

[25-Jun-18 08:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I don't get the over fascination with them :/

[25-Jun-18 08:09 PM] jansako#3330
cause I do not have to run my company PC at home at all times.

[25-Jun-18 08:10 PM] jansako#3330
and because it is a company PC so there is that little moral dilemma

[25-Jun-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[25-Jun-18 08:11 PM] jansako#3330
who would you sell your obsolete hardware to if not hobbyists? LOL

[25-Jun-18 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
What's "obsolete hardware"?

[25-Jun-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If it still makes a penny, that's a penny I didn't have b4

[25-Jun-18 08:12 PM] jansako#3330
There will be such at some point unless your electricity is free

[25-Jun-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yeah, that only happens when you piss away profits on pools üòõ

[25-Jun-18 08:13 PM] jansako#3330
LOL. I need to go cry in bed now...

[25-Jun-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
LOL

[25-Jun-18 08:13 PM] dan.#2473
lol

[25-Jun-18 08:14 PM] Tyrael#0138
@ComputerGenie how many miners do you have right now ?

[25-Jun-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think, like 40 1080TIs and so far, 1 z9 mini

[25-Jun-18 08:15 PM] Tyrael#0138
400 z9 mini on the way ?

[25-Jun-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and a few sha asics
