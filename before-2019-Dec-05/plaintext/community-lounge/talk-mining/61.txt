make orders for shit prices that will never activate, wait until price drops, edit the price to around the minimum to start hashing

[23-Oct-18 07:15 PM] Alright#0419
do tiniest orders you can

[23-Oct-18 07:15 PM] jansako#3330
I don;t get the last part... why tiny orders when there is a 10kSat fee for each order?

[23-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
the price won't always stay around what you set it to

[23-Oct-18 07:16 PM] jansako#3330
I mean my order sizes are usually 0.05-0.1

[23-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
yea....

[23-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
nevermind 😛

[23-Oct-18 07:16 PM] jansako#3330
no, too few zeros

[23-Oct-18 07:17 PM] jansako#3330
0.005-0.01

[23-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
oh right, read that as .005-.01 myself too

[23-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
.05 - .1 would work fine

[23-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
the thing is that, you cannot lower the price of an order

[23-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Alright#0419
so you need to have orders that will hash for relatively short periods of time

[23-Oct-18 07:18 PM] jansako#3330
right, only up

[23-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Alright#0419
you can edit them down, but it's better to just make a new order

[23-Oct-18 07:19 PM] Alright#0419
can only lower it by like .001 every 10 minutes I think

[23-Oct-18 07:19 PM] jansako#3330
I will check it out though, thank you!

[23-Oct-18 08:14 PM] WeyezOD#1176
UGH!!  Ive been mining over on @TheMiningPool for the past 2+ days. Found the last 3 blocks.  21 straight hours since the last block Along comes a single wallet with 2.8Msols/s, finds a block in 10 minutes and gets 1/3 of the block reward. Doesn't seem fair.

[23-Oct-18 08:20 PM] WeyezOD#1176
... and now has left the pool. Thanks a LOT!!

[23-Oct-18 10:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hmmm anyone think this delay with restocking z9s is fishy?

[23-Oct-18 10:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, it's highly suspect that 1 week after the last day of shipments they aren't restocked with 100s of thousands of specialized items 🙄

[23-Oct-18 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810

[23-Oct-18 10:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Considering they did preorders for all the ones before  it seems suspect they don't have a timeframe for next shipment and with an albeit liquid cooled 180ksol for 2200 watts out there already maybe a new model in the not so distant future is all I'm saying

[23-Oct-18 10:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I bet that if you do the R&D, they will push them faster

[23-Oct-18 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
they lost their main chip designer

[23-Oct-18 10:59 PM] Hermes#6934
interesting so Innsilicon   has an open way to sell their  A9 Z master units

not me, I don't buy overpriced toys 😛

[24-Oct-18 04:43 PM] gmr#4027
gj but i found lowest price 👌

[24-Oct-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Hope you're paying less than $78

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 have you ever done stuff like this, sharing 1 psu across multiple rigs? http://blog.stuffedcow.net/2014/01/more-cardboard-boxes/

More Cardboard Boxes

[24-Oct-18 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, boxes cost too much 😛

[24-Oct-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, as far as the PSU sharing goes, yes I have

[24-Oct-18 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is what I am most interested in

[24-Oct-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
that page has nice pictures, more than most other descriptions

[24-Oct-18 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 do you have advice on calculating how much to hook up to 1 PSU? I know power usage is variable and spikes sometimes

[24-Oct-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am only looking to do very low power CPU rigs, no GPU, very few if any peripherals

[24-Oct-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think the CPU+mobo are the biggest power users, and RAM I guess

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it seems that a 650w psu can supply at least 2 ryzen rigs, but i am not sure how much buffer to allow

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
will probably have usb 3.0 HD and usb wifi adapter, that is about it

[24-Oct-18 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I usually figure out the max pull of each item and add 15% (even though most say 10%) and that's where I set the limit

[24-Oct-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 thanks, that is great advice

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[24-Oct-18 05:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
i like the idea of these cardboard boxes because they use space efficiently, right now I have mobo's lying flat on a wire rack

[24-Oct-18 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
i wouldn't fully close them, but having "cardboard blades" would be nice

[24-Oct-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
space efficient yes, but once they get any real use (especially mining) that space is a detriment

[24-Oct-18 05:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you are saying that the density creates heat problems?

[24-Oct-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
because i got too many of those already 😹

[24-Oct-18 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not "density alone" but airflow is a **huge** factor in mining

[24-Oct-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
i could see maybe 50% of the density that those pics show, he wasn't making mining rigs

[24-Oct-18 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
and no need to restrict airflow

[24-Oct-18 05:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am looking to make these wire racks I have hold more mobo's, a simple placement only gives about 8 per rack, but I think I could probably make 16 work with some stacking

[24-Oct-18 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
at least now I know, 1 psu for 2 mobo's is viable, which really changes some statistics

[24-Oct-18 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wire/steel racks and some aluminum "L" stock can go a long way to standing MBs on their side 😉

[24-Oct-18 05:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
that sounds like a nice idea

[24-Oct-18 05:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is it safe to stack PSUs on top of each other, or should they be given room to breathe?

[24-Oct-18 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as you're not blocking air to/from, I've strapped 5 1300 watters together before

[24-Oct-18 06:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
only using 1 psu for between 2-4 rigs leads to quite some savings at scale

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[24-Oct-18 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be using a more expensive PSU with more capacity can end up with a lower PSU cost perrig

[24-Oct-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏼 That's what I did with my 13 GPU rigs (running with 1x 500W for the mobo/risers and 1x 4k watt for the GPUs)

[24-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
4kw! like a small power station

[24-Oct-18 06:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh a guy on bct used to make a breakout that combined 2x 2k watt server PSUs (he had custom made fan brackets for them too

[24-Oct-18 06:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sadly he no longer makes them 😭

[24-Oct-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i need to calculate how much power one of my units will draw, then I can see which PSU size will minimize costs

[24-Oct-18 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
look up the TDP and add 5%

[24-Oct-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
adding 5% to each **or** 15% to total
It doesn't math the same, but both seem to workout with enough overhead

[24-Oct-18 07:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
i didn't realize the ryzen 7 2700 and 2700x were actually different (65w vs 105w TDP, 3.2 vs 3.7Ghz cores)

[24-Oct-18 07:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are almost the same price, but power draw is a lot more on 2700x

[24-Oct-18 07:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
the 2700x doesn't come with a fan and was $10 different, thought it was the fanless model. need to read fine print

[24-Oct-18 07:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
a 45w TDP model just came out as well, interesting possibilities for those wanting to minimize power costs

[24-Oct-18 07:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is a really nice resource: ```https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_7```

[24-Oct-18 07:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, they make us do all kinds of math and shit picking a CPU anymore 😦

[24-Oct-18 07:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 does each mobo have it's own TDP, in addition to each part?

[24-Oct-18 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nothing really meaningfully measurable for the board itself

[24-Oct-18 07:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, they don't really provide any stats in easy-to-find places

[24-Oct-18 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
not finding any stats for TDP of ddr4 ram, which is probably low (i guess the +15% at the end accounts for small stuff)

[24-Oct-18 07:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
the CPU seems like 80% of the total TDP, other draws will be cpu fan + 2 usb sticks, pretty small power draw

[24-Oct-18 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
65w for CPU + 20% for everything else + 15% safety buffer is 89.7w, pretty amazingly low

[24-Oct-18 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is 6-7 cpu rigs per 650w psu, depending on some fuzzy math

[24-Oct-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
less than a 100watt lightbulb and does billions of instructions per second

[24-Oct-18 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
modern hardware is amazing. i started off playing with 386's + 486's

[24-Oct-18 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
you only get 4 2700x's on that same psu

[24-Oct-18 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
or else you need a 1000w psu to do 7 2700x's

[24-Oct-18 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure how viable it is to split cables to so many machines, i am shooting for 4 rigs per 1 psu

[24-Oct-18 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
which fits nicely, 4 rigs per shelf, 4 shelfs per rack. which gives 4 psu's and 16 rigs on a single rack

Pirate "team" and devs are eligble to enter, and I explained why in the #pirate channel.

[24-Oct-18 09:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Here is my official stance:
These people work hard on pirate.   They are really not compensated for their time in any set terms.   This is a product of learning and the passion to develop.  If they want to facilitate the growth of the community in ways that most others are unable to, then you better bet your sweet peg leg having, eye patch wearing,  swine sweat swiling pirate ass that I am going to let them.  If I could give them more entries I would.

This isn't some waltonchain goof where I'm gonna post from the Pirate chain account - 
🚀 🚀 🚀 ❤ ❤ ❤  OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE I WON.  @PirateChain YOU'RE THE BEST!!!❤ ❤ ❤  🚀 🚀 🚀


These are hard working community members working very hard on very cool behind the scenes stuff and I hope you agree with me on the above.
And if ya don't, well shove off ye land lubbers.
I will be video taping the draw results as well so rest assured, everyone who is playing fairly will have the appropriate  chance to win!
