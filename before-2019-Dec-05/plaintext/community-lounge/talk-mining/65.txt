Can you mine arrr on mac?

[01-Nov-18 10:36 PM] Hermes#6934
You can try some of these options, I will recommend GPU mining if you can use your Mac for this purpose https://piratepool.io/getting_started

hello guys, how can i check my status in this pool https://piratepool.io/

[02-Nov-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it takes an hour to process payments, maybe a bit more. look at your worker stats and you can also see payment status

[02-Nov-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810

that one doesnt have a hyperlink to the completed tx

[02-Nov-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
that means the tx isnt completed

[02-Nov-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
wait for that to complete, then all the payments for that round will be done

[02-Nov-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
until it is done, it isnt done

[02-Nov-18 12:06 PM] flo0#0517
k, thx

[03-Nov-18 03:25 AM] Seek#0355
hey guys, I've never done mining before and would like to get into it,is there a mining rig you guys recommend me buy to start with this? i am looking to experiment with about $500 as budget

[03-Nov-18 04:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'd recommend a Z9 mini, it is a bit above your price range ($750 USD plus postage) but it is your best bet.

[03-Nov-18 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think they are making minis anymore

[03-Nov-18 04:45 AM] Seek#0355
ok thanks

[03-Nov-18 04:45 AM] Seek#0355
if mini isnt available whats the next best one i can try

[03-Nov-18 04:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Oh is that right? What are they selling now? I think the full Z9 but that is a lot more expensive.

[03-Nov-18 09:29 AM] jansako#3330
He can always buy a second hand mini... the prices are very different based on the location though

[04-Nov-18 10:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Looks like you don't have a config.json file. Make sure you've followed the installation instructions and created that file

mining km d on my z9 has been solid

[04-Nov-18 07:45 PM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
averaging about 14k sol on each z9 mini (2) OC to 650

[04-Nov-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Ric of Ric & Thadeus I'm assuming those are batch "1"?

[04-Nov-18 08:15 PM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
i have no clue...i would assume so...i bought mine used

[04-Nov-18 08:15 PM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
I just got them fully setup last night...was mining some kmd...just switched them over to pirate...

[05-Nov-18 04:32 AM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 from what ive seen the batch 2 ones can be oc'd if they get a different firmware

[05-Nov-18 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Ric of Ric & Thadeus yes, or by simply using browser edits, but they tend to be "hit and miss" as to stability when overclocked (so that's why I assumed B1)

[05-Nov-18 04:47 AM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
forsure. I know bitmain isnt making them anymore...Found a site that has them new for 770 but dont know what shipping costs would be as its in france i believe...2 more would do me well

[05-Nov-18 04:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're thinking of 2x used minis @ 770, you might as well spend 500 more and get a nib Z9

[05-Nov-18 05:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Nib?

[05-Nov-18 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326

`United States        8471.50.0150        0%` <- FedEx has used that on every shipment I've gotten in the last 2 years

[05-Nov-18 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 this custom z9 firmware looks cool, you can set a custom hashrate for each hashboard: https://releases.broked.net/

[05-Nov-18 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's possible to overclock batch 3 z9 mini's via `ssh`, at least to 550. More requires binary patching the `cgminer` binary :abusedsmily:

[05-Nov-18 06:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
```ssh to miner.
edit /config/cgminer.conf
see bitmain-freq in config file, change value.
save file.
"/etc/init.d/cgminer.sh restart"```

[05-Nov-18 06:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
values more than 550 will be ignored, but hey, free 10% OC, I'll take it

[05-Nov-18 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll pass on 3.5% of my hashrate going to someone else

[05-Nov-18 06:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i didn't see that 😃

[05-Nov-18 06:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
but if you can OC 30% more, paying somebody 3.5% makes sense

[05-Nov-18 06:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Please note that this firmware is "free", but does include a small developer fee consisting of 10 minutes of developer mining time for every 280 minutes of regular mining. The exception to this is when the miner is first started, it will mine for the user for 10 minutes, and then developer for 10, at which point it will cycle 280minutes user, 10 minutes developer.`

[05-Nov-18 06:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` OC 30% more,` only applies if you have 1 bad board

[05-Nov-18 06:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
these are for late batch z9's

[05-Nov-18 06:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
that can't be overclocked

[05-Nov-18 06:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's hard to keep track of all the sheisty stuff Bitmain is doing

[05-Nov-18 06:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
later z9+z9m have a hardcoded limit of 550 in the cgminer binary

[05-Nov-18 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wouldn't call any of it "sheisty" other than cherry-picking chips for B1

[05-Nov-18 06:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe you know all this, I am just trying to OC my little batch3 z9m

[05-Nov-18 06:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
10% OC for reading bitcointalk for 10 minutes, I will call that a win

[05-Nov-18 06:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't seem hard to binary patch `550` to `650`, just one character binary patch, right????

[05-Nov-18 06:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
kind of doubt my batch 3 will be stable at much higher than 550, i am sure they chose that for a reason

[05-Nov-18 06:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

that is why I hang out in here, to learn 😃

[05-Nov-18 06:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
every shitty YouTube video wanted me to download a shady binary from some rando site and flash my miner, but I figured there should be a way with good ol' ssh

[05-Nov-18 06:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
i would rather use SSH than that shitty web interface

[05-Nov-18 06:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's no part of me that's paying for closed-source fw from some random guy that didn't exist 4 months ago (or even in the alternative, giving him free hash credits at my expense)

[05-Nov-18 06:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but that's just me

[05-Nov-18 07:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto If you get that fw, this is where your hash is going: https://www.poolin.com/zec/stats

[05-Nov-18 07:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dude is making $4k a year per 1M sols

[05-Nov-18 07:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[05-Nov-18 08:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I am just trying to OC my little batch3 z9m`
Why not just bump it to the May fw?

[05-Nov-18 08:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wonder what happens if you put the newer cgminer into the old fw.... or vice versa ....🤔

Hey I’ve a question, I read on the net that gpu cards consumes 500W. Is it 500W per month?

Example: The R9 295XT has a hash rate of around 1800 H/s, and a power consumption of 500 W. 

What’s the 500W here? How long do they mention in general
