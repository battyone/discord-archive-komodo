[02-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Alright#0419
could be, seems you can't  connect to it

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
may need to use a vpn if you can't connect to any of them

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] wookie#7663
can a vpn hide me from my service provider?

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
they can't block traffic if you use a VPN

[02-Sep-18 06:40 PM] wookie#7663
but can they know where I'm visiting and who I am?

[02-Sep-18 06:40 PM] wookie#7663
sorry, but the stratum.komodo.services didn't connect either

[02-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
if you use a VPN properly, your ISP can only see that you're using a VPN, that's it

[02-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
some VPNs are better than others for privacy, if you plan on getting one, pm me

@acp what is your pool's `KMDversion` from `getinfo` call?

Anyone else find it odd that "Awesome Miner" doesn't accept crypto as payment?

[03-Sep-18 04:23 PM] $tefano.#3560
pool has banned many addresses with fake shares today.

[03-Sep-18 04:27 PM] $tefano.#3560
"50 out of the last 50 shares were invalid" 
please contact me in PM if you want so i can help you

[03-Sep-18 04:29 PM] $tefano.#3560
if you use VPN probably address is banned for some other reasons

[03-Sep-18 06:24 PM] Voight#4922

@Voight you could mine VRSC

@Alright I guess it was solo mining

[03-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
sorry, what?

[03-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
VRSC has pools now

[03-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Voight#4922
@Alright oh there wasnt last i checked. Thanx, i will look

[07-Sep-18 04:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
Can someone recommend a KMD pool that is easy to get going in?  I used suprnova months ago, prior to the software upgrade but I couldn‚Äôt get my batch file right after the update. Pretty noobish, so i am looking for a pool that has super clear instructions on how my batch file should read. Thanks.

[07-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Alright#0419
what mining software are you using @meatspoon

[07-Sep-18 04:22 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I can help you out too @meatspoon

[07-Sep-18 04:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am not at home right now. I have an old Nvidia gaming rig.  I have tried a few different mining programs, none with luck tho since earlier this year. I am open to whatever, tho. Dont mind downloading something new. My problem usually lies with there being insufficient instruction on how to write the batch file.

[07-Sep-18 04:29 PM] xRobeSx#5136
what operating system?

[07-Sep-18 04:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
I want to say Windows 7, 64 bit

[07-Sep-18 04:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@meatspoon there's download links for the EWBF miner on that thread. 

then your  start.bat should be something like this `miner --server stratum.komodo.services --user <yourKMDaddress>.MyWorker --pass x --port 3333` from what I've found. 

That's my pool, but you can change it for others.

[07-Sep-18 04:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
Thanks, when i get home i will try the suggestions. I am sure i will find some way to muck it up, so i will likely pester y‚Äôall with questions. Thanks again.

[07-Sep-18 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
does anyone know the operator of mining4.co.uk pool?

[07-Sep-18 05:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
ok, i am back.  so before I go reinventing the wheel here, I currently have the nheqminer-btg.  And I am currently set up on Suprnova.  so if anyone could help me get the text of my batch file correct, that might be easiest solution...?

[07-Sep-18 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
what's your current batch file look like

[07-Sep-18 05:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
its a mess.  heh...
nheqminer.exe -l stratum+tcp://kmd.suprnova.cc:6250 -u RUe6vtr4WzKV7E7uK21wtSuYyeysGgxdEQ.meatspoon.Desktop -p meat

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
`nheqminer.exe -l stratum+tcp://stratum.komodo.services:3333 -u RUe6vtr4WzKV7E7uK21wtSuYyeysGgxdEQ.meatspoon -p meat`
should work I think

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
i got to the point where i was just making random changes, heh

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
not familiar with nhequiminer tbh

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
oh that didn't work previously?

[07-Sep-18 05:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
no, i have a really hard time finding posts from people who use Suprnova (or any other pool for that matter).  I need my damn hand held!  hah

[07-Sep-18 05:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
one would think Suprnova would just give an example of the batch file text on their site

[07-Sep-18 05:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i think what @Alright posted should work. I think the error with the one he posted was the `.meatspoon.desktop` (2 worker names) but not sure if that's allowed

[07-Sep-18 05:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
when i run it right now i am getting a repeating message saying "resolve: the specified class was not found"

[07-Sep-18 05:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
then it tries to reconnect.

[07-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
I edited, what I posted originally

[07-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
try what's there now

[07-Sep-18 05:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
still same error message

[07-Sep-18 05:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am using the "start_1gpu.bat" file for this, dunno if that matters

[07-Sep-18 05:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
there is a start_2gpu.bat file as well, but I only have one card

[09-Sep-18 05:40 PM] Baka#2988
Anyone knoe if it is possible to mine komodo with asic ( z9 mini )
I have used supernova pool on hpu but doesn't seem to accept shares if i set up the z9 as a worker?
Sorry if this is a silly q, am new to mining.
Cheers.

[09-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Baka its possible

[09-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[09-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
just a minute, I'll show you an example

[09-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
for URL you could do something like `stratum+tcp://stratum.komodo.services:3333`

[09-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
for worker put your KMD address

[09-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
for password put anything

[10-Sep-18 12:16 AM] Baka#2988
Awesome thanks guys! I'll try the url above when home later. I think i was using port:6250 at the end of url from memory. Also might try changing username.workerid to my actual wallet address. Cheers :)

Anyone know of a program that's the opposite of Bitmain's "IP Reporter"? One where I can know the IP of an errant rig and make it beep so that it can be located...

New to kmd.  Have some 1080ti's and 1070s, is it worth mining on right now?  Whats the daily return currently with one 1080ti.  Thanks guys

[11-Sep-18 04:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So... is everyone solo mining with their Z9s?  Seems better than joining a big pool if you have a few rigs, yeah?

[11-Sep-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
my rule of thumb is never join a public pool if you have enough hash to get at least 1 block a month

{Reactions}
üêô 

[11-Sep-18 05:10 PM] coinr#7073
Risk mitigation.  One month is too much of a long shot for me.  If its a hobby, then i guess thats fine but pools for larger hash coins average out to the same anyway over long periods

[11-Sep-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@coinr Provided you have the hashrate to cover the overhead without digging into your own pocket (aka "one block per month"), if you enter into a public pool you are only accomplishing 3 things:
1) providing for some random stranger's retirement fund
2) helping to centralize hashrate
3) giving up all consensus rights in the efforts of 1) and 2)

[11-Sep-18 05:21 PM] coinr#7073
Yeah i get it, but that "overhead cost" is a killer when you are spinning a lot of machines.

[11-Sep-18 05:22 PM] coinr#7073
2 or 3 bad months is brutal

You getting any of the regular 9s?

[11-Sep-18 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
probably not, since space isn't an issue, minis are still a better bet for me

[11-Sep-18 05:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have 2 minis I ordered later than the rest.  
Paid big tarrif and they don't seem as stable above 625.    Thankfully I can OC them.
