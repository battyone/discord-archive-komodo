if it were for other miners to connect to yes... not planning on that so for a solo pool this seems to be working for now

[03-Jul-18 02:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
baby steps

[03-Jul-18 02:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
i have a dedicated node already hosting several coin daemons and personal block explorers

[03-Jul-18 02:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
and i had tested previously connecting to an external daemon instead of the local komodod... even had it polling the VRSC version of AGAMA with KMD loaded up

[03-Jul-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
never be less concerned about the stability of your solo pool than you'd be about the stability of it if others were involved; after all, your main duty is to yourself üòâ

[03-Jul-18 02:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
its a work in progress building to see if an idea I want to try is feasible...

[03-Jul-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd so love to play with VRSC, but I don't have the time or inclination to upgrade my OS and/or mess around with fixing their dynamic linking

[03-Jul-18 02:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
My company is moving into AZURE hosting and I really want to try and put together a project to host internal asset chains and block crawlers... get dev testing blockchain for retail ops use

[03-Jul-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You do know that Azure != win10, right?

[03-Jul-18 02:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes lol

[03-Jul-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

baby steps

[03-Jul-18 02:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
i dont have that access yet so at least getting itup on a 64 bit win instance helps prove some of the key steps

[03-Jul-18 02:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
id really like the dev team to write our own IIS driven webcrawlers and interfaces

[03-Jul-18 02:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
scale this onto MSSQL

[03-Jul-18 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I used all my free azure with a debian setup back when NEOS was minable

[03-Jul-18 02:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
we are approaching 1K retail locations worldwide and breaking $6B USD in global sales

[03-Jul-18 02:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
if i can drag this company into blockchain i see a ton of good they can do for it

[03-Jul-18 02:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
and KMD has a lot of the pieces i believe my idea needs

[03-Jul-18 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_pissed himself off thinking about NEOS üò°_

[03-Jul-18 02:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
dont feel bad... I held mine through the split and then cashed out at a high... then it went nuts

[03-Jul-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I dumped enough NEOS to cover 3 masternodes in order to pay for the Bittrex chain swap üò¶

[03-Jul-18 03:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
and my sob story is worse...

[03-Jul-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The only reason I dumped them was because I was lied to about the updates and the whole mn thing was kept secret until it was done

[03-Jul-18 03:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
I held 4400 BTCD when @jl777c  took over... and i spent them on various things shortly after using some to buy two antminers

[03-Jul-18 03:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
at peak in Dec that was $1.76M USD

[03-Jul-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I sold 35k NEOS for .3 BTC, and all I got out of the deal was 1/27th of 2 NEOS üò≠

[03-Jul-18 03:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
ouch

[03-Jul-18 03:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
i learned my lesson after...

[03-Jul-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
last I looked, they were sitting at like $2

[03-Jul-18 03:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
ive been holding James' project tokens since then

[03-Jul-18 03:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
there is something about realizing you pissed away over $1M USD that changes how you look at crypto...

[03-Jul-18 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my NEOS take away: never donate to a project if they are not willing to give you the **full** details

[03-Jul-18 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've been too lazy and ashamed to figure how much I lost not holding and buying mn

[03-Jul-18 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
ashamed... good word... exactly how i felt getting a few thousand $s for what would have been my early retirement

[03-Jul-18 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
LOL better one....
If you figure BTC ath value, I spent $44k per S9 for my 1st 2 üòõ

[03-Jul-18 03:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah me too... got the BTCD traded to BTC and bought S4s when BTC was in the hundreds

[03-Jul-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
but I did make out quite well on my 1st BTC buy....
Bought at $460 locked in price from coinbase, by the time the bank transfer cleared BTC was at $720 and a week later I cashed out at over $900. 2x in 2 weeks was golden

[03-Jul-18 03:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
but, then I did something stupid and bought a dozen S7LNs a week before S9s were released üò¶

[03-Jul-18 03:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
i got started with slush pool... and mined a little of 6 BTC from late 2010 into 2012

[03-Jul-18 03:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
over*

[03-Jul-18 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
crypto was a shitshow for me before I found KMD

[03-Jul-18 03:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
i held mine until it popped at the end of 2012

[03-Jul-18 03:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
or 13 i dont remeber now

[03-Jul-18 03:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
whenever it broke 1K and i sold it all at 1200

[03-Jul-18 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I didn't get in until 2016
kick myself every day for passing on a GPU group buy in 2010 because I thought Bitcoin was "just a fad" üò≠

[03-Jul-18 03:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[03-Jul-18 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah...

[03-Jul-18 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
i had lots of ppl roll their eyes at me too in 2010 and 11

[03-Jul-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I literally compared BTC to MySpace üòõ

[03-Jul-18 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
back then all i had was a Phenom II and an AMD Radeon 5670

[03-Jul-18 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
2oo KH/s

[03-Jul-18 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
200*

[03-Jul-18 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok scyrpt

[03-Jul-18 03:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
hell i was one of the first ppl to sell LTC on eBay

[03-Jul-18 03:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
that was fun

[03-Jul-18 03:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
I even made a few $$$ on MEC when it first popped after Dr Kimoto created Gravity Well

[03-Jul-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my best per hash mining was UNB. about every 16 months the diff drops super low and I make a killing doing rentals on it, the flip side is it spends 6-9 months after that at insane high diff moving like 1 block a day

[03-Jul-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
last low it was $100+ per block and the diff was like 100k; me and one other guy doing rentals rolled 4032 blocks in like 27 hrs

[03-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Alright#0419

I literally compared BTC to MySpace üòõ

Might be an accurate comparison

[03-Jul-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Given that we're still trading BTC and I don't know anyone that's been on myspace in close to a decade, I'm gunna say, "no" üòõ

[03-Jul-18 03:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
^^

[03-Jul-18 03:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
But BTC is quickly becoming Facebook... and too big for its own good and showing signs of stumbling

‚òë 

[03-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
I make that comparison all the time while trying to explain blockchain to normies

[03-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
like "bitcoin might not grow, but cryptocurrencies overall will"

[03-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
"*could* be like myspace"

[03-Jul-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think @daemonfox is more right with farcebook

[03-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
MySpace is still around

[03-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
yea so is BTCD

[03-Jul-18 03:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
lololol

[03-Jul-18 03:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
touche

[03-Jul-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
especially, now, with all of the economic driven changes fb keeps making and all of the backend deals to drive the "tech"

[03-Jul-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
#LN :troll:

[03-Jul-18 03:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
So when do we get FaceBlock?

[03-Jul-18 03:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
someone has to be working on that lol

i kid...

[03-Jul-18 03:29 PM] wookie#7663
Is anyone here dual-mining? I'd like to find out how to do it. Any help is appreciated.

[03-Jul-18 03:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
Utrum should be taking care of that in a much more respectable manner

[03-Jul-18 03:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
reputations and all...

[03-Jul-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is morally opposed to dual-mining (and his argument is ironically counter to his argument in favor of asset chains)_

[03-Jul-18 03:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
wait...

[03-Jul-18 03:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
whats wrong with dual mining?

[03-Jul-18 03:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
its been in existence sinc eBTC/NMC

[03-Jul-18 03:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
from merged mining to actual dual ming

[03-Jul-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If your shitcoin doesn't have the community to sustain it without leaching the hash of some other coin (also lessening the efficiency of mining that higher coin), then your shitcoin should die

[03-Jul-18 03:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok...

[03-Jul-18 03:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
merged mining was not originally a choice by dev...

[03-Jul-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no one ever had a merge core that wasn't by choice

[03-Jul-18 03:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
it was a "feature" cloned from BTC coinbase that all clones that didnt change the parameters could do

[03-Jul-18 03:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
just like low diff SAFE mining for KMD notaries...

[03-Jul-18 03:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
SAFE messed up there

[03-Jul-18 03:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
other old coins found out later and chose not to change it

[03-Jul-18 03:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
and merge mine

[03-Jul-18 03:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
today...

[03-Jul-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yeah, that's not even close to right

[03-Jul-18 03:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
you think NMC and the earliers ones merge mined out of the gate?

[03-Jul-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think someone (I'm too lazy to think of who, when, etc) said .... hey, if we do this, then we can promote "security" without having to have any miners of our own and our shitcoin will pay us free $

[03-Jul-18 03:36 PM] wookie#7663
can kmd in theory be dual mined with smthg else?

[03-Jul-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@wookie ware you asking dual mine or merge mine?

[03-Jul-18 03:37 PM] wookie#7663
I'm fairly noob to mining. I was asking about dual.
