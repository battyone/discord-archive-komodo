sounds nice but also sounds like a code nightmare

[19-Jun-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be much harder for a utxo based coin. i think DCR solves it via creating "ticket"

[19-Jun-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so each ticket has equal weight and has an owner and a staker

[22-Jun-19 02:16 AM] bishop#9773
@jl777c Does discord have a bot that allows autobanning/deleting on content strings? Seems these spam posts all contain the same content. Or blocking urls would work too

[22-Jun-19 02:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
they often change URLs and slightly change text

[22-Jun-19 02:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
seems like harassment at this point

[24-Jun-19 02:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They are offering refund,  so if I can get the btc back no worries also offering an option of waiting and getting a coupon

[24-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
do you get the btc amount back you paid x months ago

[24-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or the fiat equivalent

[24-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because if the first then you are better off cancelling?

[24-Jun-19 02:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They better do the btc, or else will look at coming at them with a “theft by conversion” suit

[24-Jun-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Since they price in USD, I think that might be a hard case to win

Mosques receive free energy in Iran. Iranians have set up Bitcoin miners in them. There’s around 100 here, producing around $260,000 USD a year. This money goes a long way in Iran’s choked sanctioned economy. https://t.co/fczwdqCPAd

@Pool-Operator  friendly reminder to update your pool daemon to `KMDversion 0.4.0a` ASAP if you haven't done yet. Otherwise, you will be on fork on 15th July. Please post here or ping me as soon as you have updated. More than half of the pools are not updated according to our knowledge. So far the following list of pools already updated.
```
http://chickenpool.com/
https://minethechains.com/

If your pool is on the list, please ignore my message. If your pool is not on the above list, you need to update. If you have updated and your pool is not on the list, please let us know.
Thank you very much for your support.

About Hush. 
I was wondering about that.
As the official git has no updates.
What's the deal with HUSH exactly ?

Anyone have experience over clocking Blackminer for Verus ?

[28-Jun-19 06:57 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
depends on the quality of chips used in the blackminer. saw reports running them on 520, personally can't go above 508, saw folks having problems at 420... It's a trial and error thingy

[28-Jun-19 08:28 AM] rainbro7#4735
Would anyone here be willing to mine a coin  for me if I paid? I would pay in advance and in monthly increments.

[28-Jun-19 08:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
You could use nicehash and rent the hash.
There is also mining rigs rental is you google.

[28-Jun-19 08:35 AM] rainbro7#4735
Most online mining rentals don't allow for coins with new/modified algorithms :/

[28-Jun-19 11:25 AM] phm87#7395
You will find more algos where you can find hashrate to rent on hashtap.ca

[28-Jun-19 11:26 AM] phm87#7395
If the algo is not on it, it can be added maybe. What is the algo ? Lyra2z variant ? Yescrypt variant ?

[28-Jun-19 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@rainbro7 that kind of coin/algo and how much equipment are you wanting/needing?

[28-Jun-19 03:18 PM] rainbro7#4735
An interesting equihash variant: https://ergoplatform.org/basics/

[28-Jun-19 03:20 PM] rainbro7#4735
Seems like a gtx 1070 is a decent option according to the team. Anything anyone can provide.

[28-Jun-19 03:22 PM] rainbro7#4735
Wow, hashtap seems interesting.

[28-Jun-19 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, you're looking to rent **1** GPU?

[28-Jun-19 03:26 PM] rainbro7#4735
Maybe a better gauge is price. Like 2k per a month.

[28-Jun-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, I'll rent you 1 GPU for $2k per month :troll:

[28-Jun-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You'd pretty much have to put out there what you're looking for out of that $2k and let folks decide from there if they'd be willing to do it

[28-Jun-19 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's several people, besides myself, that have equipment "to spare"

[28-Jun-19 03:37 PM] rainbro7#4735
Just looking for someone to set up and mine the coin. Not looking for anything too special 😂 I wish I could mine it myself but it is pool resistant (so nicehase wont work I think) and I dont have the hardware. I rather trust a miner on here.

[28-Jun-19 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Just looking for someone to set up and mine the coin. `
right, but what I mean more specifically:
1 GPU? 10? 100?
what split percentage are you seeking on the rewards? Or are you looking for all of the rewards it brings and they just get the $2k?
etc.

[28-Jun-19 03:43 PM] rainbro7#4735
Ah, I understand. Is payment of 1.35 electricity costs fair? Or at cost payment and a coin split of 70 30. Something like that.

[28-Jun-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"fair" is relative, that's why I'm saying your best bet is to be specific and see if what you want is attractive to folks

[28-Jun-19 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
example:
```
I want to rent 15 GPUs for an entire month to mine CoinY.
I have a $2,000 budget and I expect:
x
y
z```

[28-Jun-19 03:54 PM] rainbro7#4735
Got it, thanks computer genie. That is best. I think I need to look more into the costs first.
