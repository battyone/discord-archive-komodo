[17-Jun-19 04:08 PM] radix42#3743
yeah I'd say so

[17-Jun-19 04:08 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
Okay

[17-Jun-19 04:09 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
Have you ever experimented with Docker or Kubernetes?

[17-Jun-19 04:09 PM] radix42#3743
not really no

[17-Jun-19 04:09 PM] radix42#3743
I'm into porting so I've got tons of crazy boards all over

[17-Jun-19 04:09 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
that could be fun to try mining from a container 😃

[17-Jun-19 04:10 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
SBC or MCU?

[17-Jun-19 04:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn if you want to mine slowly, you can mine Equihash in a browser :troll_thuglife:

[17-Jun-19 04:10 PM] radix42#3743
SBC

[17-Jun-19 04:10 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
@dukeleto I already heard the name somewhere

[17-Jun-19 04:10 PM] radix42#3743
I've got a pi, a nano pi m4, a couple of rock64's

oh god

[17-Jun-19 04:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn what name?

[17-Jun-19 04:10 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
is the algorithm processed with the js machine?

[17-Jun-19 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a README that explains it

[17-Jun-19 04:11 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
@dukeleto equihash

[17-Jun-19 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
Equihash is the algorithm behind ZEC/KMD/HUSH and many chains

[17-Jun-19 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is what we are talking about, Equihash (200,9) mining

[17-Jun-19 04:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 fancy seeing you here

[17-Jun-19 04:12 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
I kinda want to do the thing hardcore like command line but thanks maybe I'll give it a shot

[17-Jun-19 04:12 PM] radix42#3743
heh

[17-Jun-19 04:12 PM] radix42#3743
got pinged about rasp pi stuff 😃

[17-Jun-19 04:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn do you want to learn, or make money?

[17-Jun-19 04:13 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
learn

[17-Jun-19 04:13 PM] pinkcookie#4334
@dukeleto I heard that Kmd may move to a different algorithm . Is that still a part of the plan?

[17-Jun-19 04:13 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
I'll make money later with some project I'm baking

[17-Jun-19 04:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@pinkcookie i think you heard wrong

[17-Jun-19 04:14 PM] pinkcookie#4334
Cool, just wanted to double check

[17-Jun-19 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
Learning about mining basically means becoming part sys-admin

[17-Jun-19 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
If that doesn't interest you, you probably don't want to be a miner

[17-Jun-19 04:15 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
I see

[17-Jun-19 04:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
Or you can use GUI programs that will take a large % of your earnings. I don't use those

[17-Jun-19 04:15 PM] radix42#3743
heh, I'm all sysadmin, I just never have the money for the mining gear lol

[17-Jun-19 04:15 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
I like sys admin

[17-Jun-19 04:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 i still need to setup mining on my nanopi, i don't have a good power source for it

[17-Jun-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you use a 4amp barrel connector?

[17-Jun-19 04:16 PM] radix42#3743
don't have the right one!

[17-Jun-19 04:16 PM] radix42#3743
its on usb C and always bitches about under voltage

[17-Jun-19 04:16 PM] radix42#3743
or current whatever

[17-Jun-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, usb C maxes out at 2.5amp but it can pull 4amp when all cores are in use

[17-Jun-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you maxed out all cores you would make it shit

[17-Jun-19 04:17 PM] radix42#3743
it's powered off right now

[17-Jun-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn learning still costs money, is my advice. z9 mini's are the cheapest way to learn to mine Equihash coins. You can use GPU's, but they will never be profitable on Equihash ever again. Your learning adventure is up to you

[17-Jun-19 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
z9 mini's cost less than almost all GPU's now, which is really funny

[17-Jun-19 04:19 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
ok thankks

[17-Jun-19 04:20 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
can you interface it to your board?

[17-Jun-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
no comprendo

[17-Jun-19 04:22 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
it requires a high current of 25 amp?

[17-Jun-19 04:22 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
*do you interface your z9 mini to a single board computer?

[17-Jun-19 04:23 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
* can you actually power it with a external power source?

[17-Jun-19 04:26 PM] pinkcookie#4334
@StEvUgnIn  z9 mini utilizes roughly 300 watts which equates to close to 1.4 amps and there are power supply’s available for a power source

[17-Jun-19 04:32 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
the voltage source is 12 Volts

[17-Jun-19 04:32 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
*okay got it

[17-Jun-19 04:33 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
have you ever experimented using renewable energy for mining?

[17-Jun-19 04:33 PM] pinkcookie#4334
on a 120 voltage source you’re looking at 2.3 amps

[17-Jun-19 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
with efficiency losses, is more like 2.5amps on the wall

[17-Jun-19 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
PSU efficiency depends on 120/220v and ambient temp

[17-Jun-19 04:51 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
okay thanks

[17-Jun-19 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn you are early in your journey, just keep learning as much as you can. Having a journal where you right down what you learn and what is not making sense also helps you learn faster

To mine and get paid in LABS:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u LABS_ADDRESS -p c=LABS,zap=LABS``` 
Exchange to BTC:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC```
Exchange to BTC but mine only LABS:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC,zap=LABS```

That’d be nice. Needs a whole new RPC framework embedded.  Haven’t found anyone with the desire add it to yiimp code.

I’m sure all of you guys already know this, but let me tell you about my scam experience on eBay. First off never send any crypto to eBay sellers! I’m sitting chomping at the bits to get a Z11 because I want to my mining op to grow, so I venture over to eBay because all z11’s are sold out. I see this ad and buy the machine because this guy has great reviews but he wants to be paid in crypto, at first I find it strange but then again I have bought so many machines from bitmain that it doesn’t seem that odd. Long story short this guy says the listing was never his and basically I sent my btc to a scammer address either it be him or someone that “hacked” his eBay account. So let me lose out on money so you don’t! Don’t send crypto to eBay sellers, bad idea friends!

[17-Jun-19 11:57 PM] bishop#9773
Ugh, that scam has been going on for so many years now.

[18-Jun-19 01:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since before ASICs even

[18-Jun-19 03:47 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
@dukeleto I still live at my parents home I can't afford to deploy mining rigs as I don't pay for electricity

[18-Jun-19 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn i think you have that backwards 👼

[18-Jun-19 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
best time to mine is when electricity is free

that is a coin geared for CPU mining. KMD/HUSH/ZEC are all ASIC coins, where you need to buy special hardware

big early asic buyers and the asic manufacturers themselves wind up with huge amount of the collective coins mined by asics

[18-Jun-19 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that may well be true, but that doesn't counter-balance an "asic resistant" chain and my ability to drop $400k on GPUs and you can only buy 2

[18-Jun-19 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in fact, it doing it makes your barrier to entry greater than on an "asic friendly" chain

[19-Jun-19 03:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User luckpool ZEN is custodial, it's a convenience to stake your funds and earn some extra. You can choose between 0 and 100% of mined earnings to be staked on pool, then request a payout

Maybe some exchange wallet which got used after they reopened

[19-Jun-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a 1.5mil utxo depositned 250k into binance, it was one months of rewards!

[19-Jun-19 10:03 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes correct just noticed Vo9KWjXT was the deposit so RqqkQmi was a cold store
So maybe they claim rewards only on the hotwallet

[19-Jun-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought it was a user that deposited to the binance address?

[19-Jun-19 10:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
I dont think so Vo9KWjXT is the hot wallet and got 250k it did not go to a user deposit address which than would be swept to Vo9KWjXT

[19-Jun-19 10:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
More from cold to hotwallets is a sign that more people are withdrawing now, so good sign 😃

DCR did, but it made special protocol changes. so did NXT and even HEAT

[19-Jun-19 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c did they use "shared" keys or something?

[19-Jun-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
they support delegating your stake to another pubkey

[19-Jun-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so address X -> gives stake power to Y

[19-Jun-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
when Y stakes it uses Y + sum of all Xi as its staking power
