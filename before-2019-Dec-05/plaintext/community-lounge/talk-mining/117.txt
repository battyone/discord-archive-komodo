simple stuff: find equihash solver written in C, copypasta

but sure, it's only for miners 🤦🏽

doesn't matter if it's used or not.. i can add a dep for barracuda, doesn't mean you actually need it

good luck with C/C++ combination. won't work.

[18-Apr-19 10:30 PM] phm87#7395
And honestly, I don't know why there is some code related to CUDA (using nvidia gpus) within the stratum that run on my server. Usually, CUDA is within miner (ccminer or else)

[18-Apr-19 10:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`good luck with C/C++ combination. won't work.`
I guess we should just scrap komodod and iguana and start some new project then

[18-Apr-19 10:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's probably there to provide support for whomever wants to mine with an AI rig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[18-Apr-19 10:31 PM] Ondalf#1318
works i guess... C written solver is enough. just forget the random tryout of including equi in yiimp. it simply doesn't work.

another way would be to get node-stratum-pool from s-nomp project to talk via mysql with yiimp frontend. there's actually examples already in github

[18-Apr-19 10:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
s-nomp = 🍝

[18-Apr-19 10:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
have you actually looked into what cuda is used on that?

[18-Apr-19 10:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
have you tried taking it out and see what happens?

so, stop pointing into utterly useless repo, that has just *whatever found from corners* code in it

[18-Apr-19 10:42 PM] Ondalf#1318
and what comes to equi solving bits, seek for C solver. that's all you need. you can interface that to do 200,9 and rest of the variants. i proved it by writing those.

[18-Apr-19 10:45 PM] Ondalf#1318
i won't say, it is/was easy, but result is viewable on zpool anyways. sapling (one row into coinbasetx header more and tons of zeros at the end of coinbasetx) was done in collaboration with phm.

[18-Apr-19 10:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
PRO Tip: Since KMD core will soon learn -ac_NK params and every new asset chain will be able to choose it's N,K values, it's smart for mining pool operators to plan on supporting any combination of N,K

[18-Apr-19 10:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
that code is in LABS komodo but hasn't landed in mainline yet

[18-Apr-19 10:51 PM] Ondalf#1318
Got it already. Stratum sniffs the header

[18-Apr-19 10:52 PM] Ondalf#1318
Will be adding more variants once they pop up

[18-Apr-19 10:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
😲

[18-Apr-19 10:55 PM] Ondalf#1318
Basically it works now as so; we could throw all equi coins into one kitchen sink and it will send via stratum the variant and needed personalization string and mine the most profitable from single port. Hopefully I didn't overdo it

[18-Apr-19 10:57 PM] phm87#7395
@dukeleto  as we'll have n,k params in -ac_ do you know if it will handle -ac_pers for a personalization string per AC ?

[18-Apr-19 11:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PRO Tip: ComputerGenie will not be supporting any K&N values that require more RAM than 200,9

_says let them stay on their own mess if they want their own not equihash thing in equihash 👆🏽_

`i won't say, it is/was easy, but result is viewable on zpool anyways. sapling (one row into coinbasetx header more and tons of zeros at the end of coinbasetx) was done in collaboration with phm.`
@Ondalf I'm not sure how/why you dragged yourself into an elongated months-long conversation, but....
While I always welcome valuable input, pointing to the pool that's the cause of the topic as an example isn't that. This entire feken conversation started because zpool had the equihash bits and crackerz wanted to pay someone to write KMD into his pool but he refused to share the equihash bits.
In other words, he wanted someone to start with less than he already and redo everything he already had, blind.

[18-Apr-19 11:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And now, him and phm want to control 4 NNs between them and I asked if they were going to share those bits with the community they intend on benefiting from.....

[19-Apr-19 01:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 i think adding -ac_pers seems like a good option, it just makes sense for KMD to support that and my guess is that James would merge it

[19-Apr-19 01:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are at least 7 "pers strings" in use already: https://forum.bitcoingold.org/t/list-of-equihash-coins-by-implementation-parameters/1929

[19-Apr-19 01:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
the combination of -ac_NK, -ac_blocktime and -ac_pers means you could exactly replicate other coins purely with KMD CLI arguments

[19-Apr-19 01:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can't help but wonder at what point we stop adding more sideshow tents for no purpose other than "we can" 🤔_

[19-Apr-19 01:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
what if I want my new coin to not be compatible with all existing ASICs?

[19-Apr-19 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at some point, the uniqueness of being something special for doing what no one else does is going to give way to the uniqueness of doing what *everyone* else does

[19-Apr-19 01:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD could easily provide that, via -ac_pers

[19-Apr-19 01:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am not saying it's a good idea

[19-Apr-19 01:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am saying, let the blockchain devs creating the chain make that decision. We are making the tools in the toolbox

[19-Apr-19 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what if I want my new coin to not be compatible with all existing ASICs?`
K&N alone can do that

[19-Apr-19 01:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's much less change/work to keep N/K the same and just change ac_pers

[19-Apr-19 01:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
mining programs can stay the same/etc

[19-Apr-19 01:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
but not ASICs

[19-Apr-19 02:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am not saying I think I would do this, or it's a great idea, but that is not the point

[19-Apr-19 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it's much less change/work to keep N/K the same and just change ac_pers`
because it takes more than 3 minutes to change the value in cgminer and recompile it?

[19-Apr-19 02:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 i think should definitely make the PR now, just to piss of CG

[19-Apr-19 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤣

[19-Apr-19 02:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
has anybody heard about any new equihash asics, for instance (150,5) for Beam ?

[19-Apr-19 02:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
i heard rumors that they are being developed, maybe

[19-Apr-19 02:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
(150,5) is the new hotness, evidently

[19-Apr-19 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, they've been too stuck on making just 1 thing to bother, but who knows

[19-Apr-19 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my point is/was that a variable string is wholly silly because if ASIC makers like BM alter their version of cgminer enough to make K&N variable, one more string isn't going to be an issue

[19-Apr-19 02:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i agree that it's barely a band-aid, that newer miners will be able to deal with any pers string. It's really only useful for invalidating existing HW, does nothing to protect you against future HW

[19-Apr-19 02:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It's really only useful for invalidating existing HW`
Is there some way that the var alters the algo that I'm not aware of?

[19-Apr-19 02:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other than feeding a different input into the blake?

[19-Apr-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have all nk params supported now, it would be trivial to height activate the number to change I think. Just keep rotating around... Basically means daemon solo mining is the only thing that works

[19-Apr-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
(height % N) selects the N/K from a list

[19-Apr-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 and FSM has merged the -ac for N/K params 150,5 is supported. I guess any combination is supported? even ones that are nonsensical

[19-Apr-19 08:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
nonsensical N,K support?!?!? I must be dreaming

[19-Apr-19 08:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 changing the pers string is a trivial way to change the output of all hashes without any real algo changes, so if you wanted, you could make a new 200,9 coin for which no currently available  ASICs would work for.

[19-Apr-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is that only a small subset of N/K values are valid

[19-Apr-19 08:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, and furthermore

[19-Apr-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a list of all the valid ones would be very good to have

[19-Apr-19 08:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
only a very few combinations have the ratio between N/K optimize the ratio between GPU and ASIC mining efficiency

[19-Apr-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so some are GPU centric and others ASIC?

[19-Apr-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but if there is no ASIC...

[19-Apr-19 08:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c very small %

[19-Apr-19 08:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
before 150,5, it was never true that N % 8 != 0

[19-Apr-19 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
people didn't want to look at it

[19-Apr-19 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
because unrolling 8 loops at a time, there was deep code about that

[19-Apr-19 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
but beam I think decided to research N%8!=0 and found 150,5

[19-Apr-19 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC never looked in that corner

[19-Apr-19 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c some combination are straight up invalid, I believe. K > N should give an error, for instance

[19-Apr-19 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
can't remember if N = K is technically valid or just dumb

[19-Apr-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i think our NK support is based on beam, so maybe it isnt limited to n%8 == 0

[19-Apr-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
would be nice to have something that lets people experiment with all the possible combinations

[19-Apr-19 09:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, I think allowing any "valid" combination of N,K, regardless of whether we think it's a good idea, makes our tool that more general

[19-Apr-19 09:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
Perhaps somebody wants to study all possible N,K values. The very best way to do that would be with KMD tools

[19-Apr-19 09:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c and yes, blackjoker ported beam code to support 150,5, i am not sure how "general" it is, I think it can support any N%5=0, but it doesn't support N%17=0 for instance

[19-Apr-19 09:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe it supports any N! that would be cool

[19-Apr-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i think efficiency doesnt matter much for the reference miner. just getting it to support all possible values alone is very cool

[19-Apr-19 09:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
agreed

[19-Apr-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r i think you ported the beam miner, did you see how hard it would be to support any N value?

[19-Apr-19 10:08 AM] Ondalf#1318
the C++ version of the solver will do generally quite many of those - the C one needs a bit fiddling as it will run into assert errors quite easily
