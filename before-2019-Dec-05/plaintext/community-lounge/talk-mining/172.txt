By wasting as much electricity as possible, the coin value is more closely connected with joules instead of speculation

[10-Aug-19 05:56 PM] zawy#5864
To be dreamy about the "ideal" it would *be* joules, transferrable over the internet, exchangeable for electricity anywhere, immediately.

[10-Aug-19 05:56 PM] zawy#5864
and vice versa

[10-Aug-19 07:47 PM] MCB999#4841
Question, in launching a smart chain using antara, what are the drawbacks from AWS nodes for mining. Does the centralization of the nodes thru Amazon pose a threat to my project

[10-Aug-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
having a few seed nodes being on AWS wont matter much as long as you will also be having people run full nodes

[10-Aug-19 08:06 PM] MCB999#4841
And that  @jl777c comes with building a community, correct? Would it be wise to have more than just seed nodes running on AWS initially until a community of ppl start to develop

[10-Aug-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you are making a corporate chain, it seems without any users it is better to get a few users. just need half a dozen to start. i guess another way to look at it is if you cant get half a dozen people interested enough in your project, then probably a bit more work is needed on getting users side of things

[11-Aug-19 12:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I am very interested in this new type of coin creation, what @zawy  is describing i know there are already interested parties on open market/exchangability end of things for a coin production tied to electricity consumption

[11-Aug-19 01:15 AM] zawy#5864
I was being really dreamy about what the ideal currency would be. I meant literally putting a kilowatt hour into a ball you could magically transfer over the internet. I'm only interested in a stable stable coin (without a peg to fiat) which would be creatde by explicitly wasting POW electricity. It's more efficient over the long term because there is no energy waste for consensus.

[11-Aug-19 01:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The idea of a ‚Äústable‚Äù stablecoin  without pegging  and proportional to electricity expenditure is what I was referring to in regards to interested parties .   Very much along the lines of what you are describing

[11-Aug-19 01:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just will keep watching you two at work

[11-Aug-19 02:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
so instead of a stablecoin you would have a "stabler coin" where it's satoshi's are more roughly equivalent to watts consumed.

[11-Aug-19 02:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@zawy when pre pre pre seed round? I am in üòÑ

[11-Aug-19 02:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Also it seems like  you have just fallen down the Komodo hole........nothing else would be good enough now üòõ

[11-Aug-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how to store the electricity on the blockchain, so redeeming it could be a problem. maybe with a physical coin, there can be something that is charged up and so possession of the coin allowed to actually use the stored energy. and somehow its usage can be detected and updated on the blockchain. seems a few years before we have all the tech for such

[11-Aug-19 09:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wait, are we talking about decentralised energy storage?

[11-Aug-19 09:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Where the currency is energy itself

[11-Aug-19 09:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You pay for things with energy, you buy food with energy, you buy things that increase your energy storage/regeneration

[11-Aug-19 09:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Your net worth is backed by the amount of energy that you have, that you can create, that you control. Holy hell, think about that. We use/d gold as the backing for currency, then created something that represented it (dollars). Why not create something that represents what is the driving factor of the modern world, energy.

[11-Aug-19 11:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
Private keys are a way to store energy. You just can't get it back out.

[11-Aug-19 02:21 PM] zawy#5864
I would like to delve into "currency as a ball of energy storage and transfer" but I need to model kmd's RST+Digi+exp.  But here's my article on curerncy.  https://zawy1.blogspot.com/2019/02/all-properties-of-money-are-derived.html

[11-Aug-19 02:31 PM] zawy#5864
The ideal currency  is constant value in all context As part if this it is proportional to the net work (energy) output for a given  time period (velocity) of the commodity infrastructure that it controls. It's the control of net work.    However, 3 people actually showing an interest (or misunderstanding that I was being both serious and ridiculous)  in "ball of energy" got me thinking about it.  The ball of energy is not supposed to be exactly energy, but should store,  transfer, and release of  net work energy.  Joules of heat are completely useless, or at least wasteful if driging a steam engine.   But look at this: we work for money and that work we do puts some amount of net energy into society.  Then we spend that money to extract net work energy back out.  So although it is more immediately precise to say money is control of net work energy, the amount of currency in our hand is a control of a ball of energy floating around in society.  If law and economics are acting correctly we put that energy out there in exchange for the bills and the bills can extract it back out.

[11-Aug-19 02:39 PM] zawy#5864
Szabo's comments on currency are very interesing and true. He reveals some interesting things such as pointing out a history of use and cost of creation are often the foundation of money.  This is extremely important to how we view BTC.  My article is trying to give a better and deeper picture  of the forest.

[11-Aug-19 04:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Was more thinking of the currency as an access token to a network of power generators.  Not literal ‚Äúenergy‚Äù .  Going to delve  into the article today .

[11-Aug-19 04:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Still exciting stuff

@jl777c These are the 0.5% per blk numerator constants for W=2 to 16 if denominator is 100.   I could not find a simple equation to generate this.  Let me know if you want to go to a higher or lower trigger threshold than 0.5%  My belief is that they will not provide much help over 2, 3, 6, 12, but if  your code is well-suited to scanning and doing these, here they are.  I just started trying to mimic what you're doing today. This was a preliminary step.

[11-Aug-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i ended up going with 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and it is working very well. it does get occasional false positives, but in such cases it almost always catches up and stops after half a dozen or less blocks and really it seems that false positives only balances out the normal luck based fluctuations

[11-Aug-19 05:35 PM] zawy#5864
What is your W = 1 num/denom?

[11-Aug-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
1/60 if blocktime is 60

[11-Aug-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if over 100, then 1/100

[11-Aug-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if less than 60, it is disabled

[11-Aug-19 08:26 PM] zawy#5864
You changed the < to <=  ?  If it is too sensitive you can try another trigger on a W = 2 that includes tipdiff as the 2nd block with num/den = 8/100 ....but it will require different RST equations

[11-Aug-19 08:26 PM] zawy#5864
I mean sum 1 < 1/60 should never trigger.

[11-Aug-19 08:27 PM] zawy#5864
But <= will

[11-Aug-19 08:27 PM] zawy#5864
And it will not hardly affect RST

[11-Aug-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i adjusted for the 1 case

[12-Aug-19 08:34 AM] zawy#5864
Can I see all your testing results?

[12-Aug-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
mostly just the initial 9x attack, then after a while down to a single core mining. mostly testing the false positive activations. overall blocktimes are close to 60 seconds

[12-Aug-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty confident that any large hashrate is just stopped in its tracks and the ave blocktime for the duration is back to normal

[12-Aug-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
there was going to be some testing of timewarp attacks, but so far it is not working

[12-Aug-19 08:44 AM] zawy#5864
MTP=1 and FTL=4?

[12-Aug-19 08:44 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c 4-second timestamp attacks?

[12-Aug-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
probably the reason it was hard to get working, i think a 51% attack is combined to rewrite past 7 blocks and then make then 1 second from each other to get exp() diff many times

[12-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright can explain clearer what he was trying, but so far it only ends up on an orphaned chain

[12-Aug-19 08:47 AM] zawy#5864
what was hard to get working?

[12-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the attack that most likely is not possible

[12-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
truly impossible things tend to be hard to get working

[12-Aug-19 08:48 AM] zawy#5864
you mean the best attack you can think of is not working?

[12-Aug-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i think anything done to gain time, ends up triggering RST

[12-Aug-19 08:48 AM] zawy#5864
so everything is good?

[12-Aug-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so far, no known attacks

[12-Aug-19 08:48 AM] zawy#5864
I can tell you the best way to attack....let me think

[12-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
RST changes the 51%, as to catch up 7 blocks, you need to do a lot more than 51% when RST kicks in. doesnt seem to matter how much, though at 10000x maybe you can brute force past 7 blocks (by then maybe 10 blocks and notarized)

[12-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so a very small window to do a very difficult thing to get a very minimal reward

[12-Aug-19 08:51 AM] zawy#5864
it will require on-off mining every block, and exploit the RST.  There should be a way to make it jump higher than yuor hashrate

[12-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the 2 quick blocks and stop seems the only exposure

[12-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, just wait for 30 seconds on each block before mining

[12-Aug-19 08:51 AM] zawy#5864
OK, so the attack would be to get 2 blocks and set them both to 1 second

[12-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or 40, or 50, wherever you want to set your threshold, you get easier than the steady miner

[12-Aug-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but if there are more than one doing this, RST kicks in

[12-Aug-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
what we might have here is a way to allow CPU to mine in conjunction with ASIC

[12-Aug-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly the ASIC will get blocks, but so can the CPU. whether it is fair to get more blocks per unit time with 10000x the hashrate, well it doesnt seem so wrong. and if ASIC are mining steadily, then the CPU cant mine

[12-Aug-19 08:53 AM] zawy#5864
lol, yeah, if CPU can mine on-off and ASIC can't, then all CPU miners cheat by design?

[12-Aug-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, need half a dozen such chains and CPU miners will have a really good ROI

[12-Aug-19 08:54 AM] zawy#5864
I supposed there's no way to make CPU advantageous over GPU

[12-Aug-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and two blocks of 1 seconds each is only a 118 second deficit, which is made up in half a dozen blocks

[12-Aug-19 08:55 AM] zawy#5864
try to cause oscillations.....during active triggers, have big miner set 1 second

[12-Aug-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there are ways, like verushash2.0 that equalizes CPU and fpga to a large degree. GPU mining is just 10x worse than cpu

[12-Aug-19 08:55 AM] zawy#5864
when difficulty is easy

[12-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
such things happen already. miners get lucky and mine at 100x the actual hashrate

[12-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
then RST kicks in, but exp() needs to rescue it

[12-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
now diff is back to 1

[12-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and easy blocks happen and RST kicks in again

[12-Aug-19 08:57 AM] zawy#5864
OK, I'll look at your data.  I shoudl be doing spreadsheet testing today...don't know when I'll have your code inside modellign

[12-Aug-19 08:58 AM] zawy#5864
I'll send it to you when it looks like the spreadhseet is close to your code.

[12-Aug-19 09:30 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c  If RST is active whenever targetB column is zero, it looks like something is wrong because the last block in a series should always be >60

[12-Aug-19 09:32 AM] zawy#5864
unless a longer window is triggered, but that's not what's happening

[12-Aug-19 09:33 AM] zawy#5864
block 268 is a good example

[12-Aug-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
RST is dormant if targetB is 0

[12-Aug-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i see what you mean, but there was a 481 right before it. maybe there is an off by 1

[12-Aug-19 09:37 AM] zawy#5864
block 1224 is just the opposite....it should not have shut off at that point

[12-Aug-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
28 seconds for prior 3 blocks

[12-Aug-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
aha! what happened was the exp() kicked in on 1225

[12-Aug-19 09:46 AM] zawy#5864
It looks like W=12 should have kicked in at 262 which is 2 blocks ahead of when it did

[12-Aug-19 09:46 AM] zawy#5864
i mean 263

[12-Aug-19 09:46 AM] zawy#5864
oh, W+1

[12-Aug-19 09:48 AM] zawy#5864
OK, so how did 336 and 337 be the last two in triggered state when both are < T?

[12-Aug-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
27 and 25 are less that the 7, 2, 3 second blocks that triggered this

[12-Aug-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is strange indeed as the deficit isnt made up unless solvetime > T

[12-Aug-19 09:51 AM] zawy#5864
I can't see why that sequence began

[12-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
268 is the first one that did this, so it is only in the false positive sequences

[12-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i think W=12 triggered it as many fast solves within 12 blocks

[12-Aug-19 09:53 AM] zawy#5864
The sum at that point was 9 instead of < 7

[12-Aug-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
11 of 12 fast blocks

[12-Aug-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
255 seconds for 12 blocks

[12-Aug-19 09:58 AM] zawy#5864
What?   255 for which 12?  Are you removing the longest solvetime or something?
