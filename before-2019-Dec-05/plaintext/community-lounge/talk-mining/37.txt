Be prepared, when they get to your house they only take check or whoever shipped mine did.

[25-Aug-18 04:25 PM] SHossain#0007
can't comply. will tell them to take them to depot, and i'll collect from there after paying.

[25-Aug-18 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
nearby depot is 15 minutes away by car

[25-Aug-18 04:27 PM] bishop#9773
I think I paid $58/unit on batch 1

[25-Aug-18 04:27 PM] bishop#9773
from ups. Trying dhl this go around as I hear they do not assess customs fees

[25-Aug-18 06:30 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
Sorry if I'm using wrong terminology but I downloaded a miner suggest by @Alright on bitcointalk....my 1060s are working fine. Sol/s is like 300. My 1070s are founders edition and adjusting settings does nothing. They are at like 100 sol/s.
Overclocking changes nothing.

[25-Aug-18 06:31 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
Do I need to download a different miner that's more compatible with 1070s founders edition

[25-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
I have no experience with anything other than 1080 and 1080tis

[25-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Alright#0419
what OS?

[25-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Alright#0419
and what miner again?

[25-Aug-18 06:32 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
Windows 10

[25-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Alright#0419
All the cards are in the same machine?

[25-Aug-18 06:32 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
I was mining Nexus. And it was performing about 1.5 times better than the 1060s

[25-Aug-18 06:33 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
1060s on one miner 1070s on the other

[25-Aug-18 06:59 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
Got it figured out

[25-Aug-18 07:00 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
My bios settings were not correct

[25-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Alright#0419
👍

[27-Aug-18 05:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Miners shipped.  Got my email notice.   Now to get this thirty amp breaker and plug installed.  How long do they take, 5 days to ship?

[27-Aug-18 07:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Depends where you live 😛

[27-Aug-18 07:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Mine are shipped, receive them in two days

If anyone is interested in mining STAKED, there should be a pool up after the chain starts. This week is 50% POW, so now's your chance to grab some

[27-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
if you have no idea what I'm talking about, check out the #private-staked channel

[27-Aug-18 07:02 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 would there be a reason not to use a PC power supply with a mini while I'm waiting for my PSU to arrive

[27-Aug-18 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
300 watts @ 12v is 300 watts @ 12v

[27-Aug-18 07:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
haha

[27-Aug-18 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wasn't trying to be funny; just meant that there's no "special" PSU for them (other than having all 10 PCIe connectors)

[27-Aug-18 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm using similar setup to these:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007CBGC8O
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078SHZKBC

[27-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Alright#0419
10? O.o

[27-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Alright#0419
I see one for the control board and 1 for each of the boards

[27-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Alright#0419
am I missing something here? 😅

[27-Aug-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, 4 not 10; my bad

[27-Aug-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[27-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Alright#0419
I do need to short one of the ATX pins or something?

Why does this things fans keep ramping up for a minute then slowing down >.>

[27-Aug-18 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because they did some math and decided how to control fans automatically because morons kept burning up S9s by setting fans to 40% and freq to 700

[27-Aug-18 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And now that auto is applied to all miners

[27-Aug-18 10:23 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
At height 983921 , the suprnova pool reward was 1597.1974 KMD - thought the block rewards were  always 3 KMD (plus mining fees) - how is this possible?

[27-Aug-18 10:26 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There are blocks that have unclaimed rewards sometimes

[27-Aug-18 10:31 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Thanks - could you please explain a little bit more? Unclaimed by whom? I was just surprised to receive in the past few hrs what would normally take over 2 weeks to mine...

[27-Aug-18 10:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Some exchanges,  some from sending fromledger

[27-Aug-18 10:51 PM] bishop#9773
When you move coins that do not have the nlocktime set, the rewards go to the miners who mine the block those tx's appear in

[28-Aug-18 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
actually, with nLockTime set, but when the reward isnt claimed

[28-Aug-18 06:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CheeseBaby some platforms, either choose to not implement or don't understand how to implement KMD interest, and by the rules of bitcoin protocol, if the inputs add up to more than the outputs, the difference goes to the miner of the block

[28-Aug-18 06:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
some KMD notary nodes have received very large "lottery blocks", it's pretty random and usually the lottery amount is very tiny, but sometimes it's not 😃

[28-Aug-18 10:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wow these suckers are loud!

[28-Aug-18 10:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it takes force to create velocity and since energy cannot be created nor destroyed the result is flow + noise

Interesting reports about UPS charging quite a bit for their brokerage fees this go around on the Z9 mini batch

[28-Aug-18 01:18 PM] bishop#9773
I went DHL this go around in hopes of avoiding them. Approximately $180ish per unit according to BTCtalk

[28-Aug-18 01:18 PM] bishop#9773
I know I was around $58-60/unit on batch one from UPS

[28-Aug-18 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
got a bitmain notification about shipping, and I didn't expect one yet since I was on the tail end of the ordering I think

[28-Aug-18 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bishop they all charge brokerage fees (unless you go to the terminal or hire a private broker)

[28-Aug-18 03:09 PM] bishop#9773
Not true

[28-Aug-18 03:09 PM] bishop#9773
plenty of people got packages without brokerage fees from DHL

[28-Aug-18 03:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the US?

[28-Aug-18 03:09 PM] bishop#9773
yep

[28-Aug-18 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from China?

[28-Aug-18 03:10 PM] bishop#9773
yep

[28-Aug-18 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, wait until they get the bill in the mail 😂

[28-Aug-18 03:10 PM] bishop#9773
lol... over 2 months and no bills

[28-Aug-18 03:10 PM] bishop#9773
The clearing code shouldn't require a true assessment

[28-Aug-18 03:11 PM] bishop#9773
just fyi

[28-Aug-18 11:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
5 of my units have arrived and are plugged in.

[28-Aug-18 11:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Id post a picture of the hashrate but it says 65K and it's beautiful 😃

[28-Aug-18 11:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I'm going to run them there for one week, then on a pool for one week and see how it varies 😃

[29-Aug-18 12:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Waiting for mine still 😭

[29-Aug-18 12:31 AM] bishop#9773
Mine come tomorrow

[29-Aug-18 12:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I got the full size so they aren't even shipping yet,  have some minis otw too but didn't order them til later on haven't heard word yet from bitmain on them

[29-Aug-18 06:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Any change in kmd hashrate yet?

[29-Aug-18 06:45 AM] jansako#3330
I see lots of new ones coming online on miningrigrentals...

[29-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hash for rent will become a lot cheaper I guess...

[29-Aug-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 15ksol on STAKED3 all week for like $30 or something.. it wasnt much

[29-Aug-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
seems about 50% higher hashrate now

[29-Aug-18 09:27 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
And not all miners have been shipped yet

[29-Aug-18 02:52 PM] $tefano.#3560
@jl777c komodo will continue to support equihash algo 200,9 or there is a plan to switch to a different solutions  ?

[29-Aug-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
we will have the same response as when the 1080 GPU came out and made 1060 GPU not so effective

[29-Aug-18 04:02 PM] SHossain#0007

@dukeleto I paid the customs charges online as soon as they notified me and they just delivered the minis in time without any delay

[30-Aug-18 12:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
they haven't asked for money yet, just sensitive personal information
