I corrected it

[28-Jun-18 12:43 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And you took it off topic

[28-Jun-18 12:43 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Don't act for 5 seconds like you didn't.

[28-Jun-18 12:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@Beetcoin im driving I’ll answer more about kmd in a few minutes. But computer genie is right in the fact that a lot of octanes are mixed to make different levels. But if I run lower octane it does throw off my fuel/timing maps and preform worse.

[28-Jun-18 12:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
But we should drop the gas because it’s irrelevant hah

[28-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Just as soon as he admits his claim was wrong, that there are cars made that in fact REQUIRE 91

[28-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Beetcoin#9049
As proven by my link

[28-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And then he can step off his soapbox about being a 4th generation mechanic

[28-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Like he's not speaking to someone in the same fucking field

[28-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Probably hasn't even passed his ASE master certs'

[28-Jun-18 12:44 PM] xRobeSx#5136
They only require it based on the way they are tuned. If they were just tuned for lower octane it wouldn’t be required

[28-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Correct

[28-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And he came back with "no, they are recommended not required", and i gave him several examples of REQUIRED vehicles

[28-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And then he went on to ignore, slander, and attack

[28-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Beetcoin#9049
all side tracking my question, of whether or not that was anyone who could point me in the direction of the logic concerning the inaction of a fork

[28-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Specifically, was it debated? Voted on?

[28-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Is there a log?

[28-Jun-18 12:46 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Well required is still sketchy. It will run with lower octane but not as well.

[28-Jun-18 12:46 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Required differs from Recommended, but some are in fact required

[28-Jun-18 12:46 PM] xRobeSx#5136
As for komodo there is just no reason to fork. ASICS are fine on our network

[28-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I've heard that answer

[28-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Beetcoin#9049
But is that under the knowledge that it will throw off more miners from the network whom were supporting it?

[28-Jun-18 12:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Why change something that isn’t broken or a problem?

[28-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Beetcoin#9049
To adhere to the fundamental construct of equihash?

[28-Jun-18 12:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Every other z fork wants to fork to prevent ASICS

[28-Jun-18 12:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Hence they are forking

[28-Jun-18 12:48 PM] xRobeSx#5136
In a dumb way too

[28-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Right, because that's what Equihash was made for

[28-Jun-18 12:48 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Not with kmd

[28-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Asic resistance to keep mining from being centralized

[28-Jun-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"To adhere to the fundamental construct of equihash?"
Are you over at BTCG giving them shit about a GPU not being a CPU? With their "one CPU one vote" mantra

[28-Jun-18 12:48 PM] xRobeSx#5136
In komodo it’s been established that notaries mine 75% even since the start

[28-Jun-18 12:49 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There’s no need to fork to prevent ASICS mining the other 25%

[28-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Beetcoin#9049
There is, if the community wants it, no?

[28-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You're affectively alienating supporters.

[28-Jun-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Asic resistance to keep mining from being centralized"
Stay tha fek off reddit and come back with a real claim

[28-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Beetcoin#9049
CG

[28-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Go read up about crypto, please

[28-Jun-18 12:50 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Well the claims that ASICS make centralization is wrong. As Genie said yesterday (you can scroll up), you can buy a 850$ gpu or 850$ asic. What’s it matter?

[28-Jun-18 12:50 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I already linked you straight to the wikipedia for equihash which uses that claim verbatim

[28-Jun-18 12:50 PM] Beetcoin#9049
its in half the white papers

[28-Jun-18 12:51 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Except for neither the asic or the gpu is $850

[28-Jun-18 12:51 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That argument is completely trash

[28-Jun-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"mining from being centralized": because some guy with $1million can but 90,000 ASICs but somehow can't buy 900,000 GPUs? ffs, enter reality

[28-Jun-18 12:51 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Try buying 900,000 gpus CG

[28-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Christ, you probably only have 4 gpus in the first place

[28-Jun-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
There's this little site called "ebay", you should chek it out

[28-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Ebay doesn't have 900,000 gpus

[28-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Stop talking

[28-Jun-18 12:53 PM] Beetcoin#9049
@xRobeSx the point was the alienation of equihash miners who are vehemently against asics, therefore supporters of the equihash movement, which is anti asic

[28-Jun-18 12:53 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And the logic behind not forking

[28-Jun-18 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Christ, you probably only have 4 gpus in the first place"
Kindly fuck off back to your unSafeCoin troll hole

[28-Jun-18 12:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Just since KMD uses equihash doesn’t mean we have to believe it can only be used for gpu miners....

[28-Jun-18 12:54 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Specifically, who speaks for the Equihash miners when a decision like this gets made

[28-Jun-18 12:54 PM] Beetcoin#9049
@ComputerGenie I don't even know what safecoin is, please stop responding, you're clearly drunk, or trolling, or both.

[28-Jun-18 12:55 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I agree, equihash isn't just for gpu miners, but it is specifically anti-asic

[28-Jun-18 12:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@Beetcoin day 1 as soon as the z9 got announced we asked @jl777c if KMD would fork or not

[28-Jun-18 12:55 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Like, NEVER asic

[28-Jun-18 12:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
literally I asked 30 seconds after seeing the miner

[28-Jun-18 12:55 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i know someone screenshotted it

[28-Jun-18 12:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
James answered instantly and said we would not fork....

[28-Jun-18 12:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
there is no reason to

[28-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Beetcoin#9049
So, one man saying "we're not going to fork we have no reason", makes that final? And nobody brings up the concern for supporters and losing that support?

[28-Jun-18 12:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Well that one man is our Lead Dev, and no one else cared...

[28-Jun-18 12:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
where were you then?

[28-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Not aware this discord was even here, apparently

[28-Jun-18 12:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
the discussion was on slack before we even came to discord

[28-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Probably busy in my mineshaft mining kmd to be honest

[28-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I don't do slack, so that's certainly a reason why

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
well that was the primary chat for KMD

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Beetcoin#9049
But its actually alarming that nobody said anything.

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
its not really that alarming, as anyone who can buy GPU's can buy ASIC's...

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
for about the same exact price

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and its more efficient

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Beetcoin#9049
They are not even close

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And that's also a terrible argument

[28-Jun-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
its better than the argument to switch...

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Beetcoin#9049
The hell it is

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
to change some values that need more memory...

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You're literally losing support for not switching

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And that's not even a remote concern for the lead dev?

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
losing support from what?

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
haha

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Beetcoin#9049
The community

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
whos that?

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you're the only one who's even mentioned it

[28-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Beetcoin#9049
The people mining KMD, discussing KMD, using KMD

[28-Jun-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Beetcoin What if I told you that the equihash paper was flawed and by the logic and math set forth in the paper, a Z9 mini can't even exist?

[28-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Please quit taggign me with nonsense CG

[28-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You're about to the limit of my allowance for trolling

[28-Jun-18 01:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
computergenie is a very established miner, he knows what he's talking about

[28-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Is he?

[28-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I can't imagine he was ever higher than myself

[28-Jun-18 01:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@Beetcoin a few other community members questioned the non fork that day, and brought it up, and we all talked it ou

[28-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I used to be #3 on Suprnova pool before I pulled support

[28-Jun-18 01:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not questioning your hash, just speaking for CG

[28-Jun-18 01:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not saying your concerns aren't valid, I'm just saying we discussed it, and doesn't really have any effect at all on our network

[28-Jun-18 01:02 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Right, but you also said jl answered within 30 seconds, and that was that, and that nobody brought it up

[28-Jun-18 01:03 PM] xRobeSx#5136
well he answered, right away, and then a few other people chimmed in, and the decision was made and talked about

[28-Jun-18 01:03 PM] xRobeSx#5136
no one else complained
