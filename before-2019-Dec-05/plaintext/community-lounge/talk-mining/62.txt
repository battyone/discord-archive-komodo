it could be on your end or it could be on the pool's end
no real way for me to troubleshoot a thing like that from here, maybe one of the networking folks around could help....

[24-Oct-18 09:26 PM] wookie#7663
I doubt it's the pool's end. I tried different pools on different coins too.

[24-Oct-18 09:26 PM] wookie#7663
maybe I'll just reboot my pc and try again

[24-Oct-18 09:41 PM] wookie#7663
ok...rebooting pc did not work. I would appreciate any help or suggestions anyone has.

[24-Oct-18 09:41 PM] wookie#7663
cpumining continue to work. Only my gpu.

[24-Oct-18 10:02 PM] wookie#7663
I think I figured it out. It's the zm miner.

[24-Oct-18 10:05 PM] wookie#7663
I switched over to ewbf's cuda miner .3b and everything is fine now. Not sure what's the difference between yesterday and today in terms of the zm miner.

[24-Oct-18 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
never used it, so I couldn't even begin to guess

[24-Oct-18 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@wookie for some reason the TLS negotiation is choosing SSLv3, which is usually turned off or disabled for security, it shouldn't be using that

[24-Oct-18 11:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
at compile time, a binary can link to different ssl libraries locally, which could effect how it tries to negotiate with a remote server

[24-Oct-18 11:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
most likely, the code that works does not try to use sslv3, which is a security hazard

"onboard graphics only work with intel athlon/etc CPUs" in tiny fine print on page 17 of the manual. well that is lame

@dukeleto, you mentioned earlier VRSC can be mined using GPUs. Could you point me in the right direction in mining pools for this? It's the coin for Verus that is on the Komodo tech right....?

Hey guys I have a MSI AMD R9 390 and I wanted to know what the best setting for the afterburner to use less power but still function efficiently cheers in advance

[26-Oct-18 11:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That's a hard question, each card performs differently. My advice would be to google some settings based on your card type, and then adjust the settings, check if it's stable and repeat until you're happy. I'm sure there are some specs out there for that card

[26-Oct-18 11:14 AM] Omar Samuels#3279
Ok ok cheers

you will get more broadcast addresses that way but that works too

[26-Oct-18 10:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's generally easier for new folks to understand than subnetting, in my experience

[26-Oct-18 10:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
How to do that?  Do I just change subnet and make all the miners have static up in the miner config screen?   I was tinkering with router ,  made  subnet mask there 255.255.255.0  but didn't do what I wanted

Well locked myself out of a miner lol,  I'm gonna have to get a networking guy to set it up.  Thought I could just chang the mask

[27-Oct-18 12:48 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`percPoS.1` says to me a ton of PoW and no PoS being done

[27-Oct-18 12:48 AM] hypocalese#3688
it was at 0 earlier today

[27-Oct-18 12:48 AM] hypocalese#3688
should I turn off the PoW miner?

[27-Oct-18 12:48 AM] hypocalese#3688
does it matter at this point?

[27-Oct-18 12:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
do you have any nodes that are trying to stake (`setgenerate true 0` or `-genproclimit=0`)?

[27-Oct-18 12:50 AM] hypocalese#3688
3 nodes genproclimit -1

[27-Oct-18 12:50 AM] hypocalese#3688
1 node genproclimit 2

[27-Oct-18 12:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
well, that's the issue then
You told the chain "I want an average of 50% of the blocks to be PoS and 50% of the blocks to be PoW" and then you did no PoS, so the diff is massivly high to allow PoS stakers to stake

[27-Oct-18 12:52 AM] hypocalese#3688
Ah now that you are explaining it makes sense.  I didnt know setgenerate true 0 was for staking
