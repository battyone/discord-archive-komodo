32 threads @ 4Ghz gives about 1.5 GH/s, according to unconfirmed reports

i can build so many low end rigs, full machines, for just the cost of that single CPU

@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 threadrippers require newer + more expensive mobo's, and don't come with fans, I am just now learning. Increases costs more than I thought. can't use no $65 mobo on these beasts, TR4 mobo's *start* at $300

@SHossain which batch? 游땎

[22-Oct-18 10:12 PM] SHossain#0007
first batch

[22-Oct-18 10:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
since those are very hard to come by, seems like a reasonable deal, as long as they are oc'able

[22-Oct-18 10:17 PM] SHossain#0007
i run them at 500. no overclocking

[22-Oct-18 10:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Been running at 700 no prob for 15ksol

[22-Oct-18 10:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 and not overclock? don't make sense

[22-Oct-18 10:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 were made to be overclocked, bitmain QA allowed the gui to overclock in them, not running them at some kind of OC just seems wasteful

[22-Oct-18 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i have the 2nd batch currently

[22-Oct-18 10:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you don't like loud fans, then I get that 游땎

[22-Oct-18 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
sometimes i did overclock them to 650. but, keep them running normal to keep the noise level down

[22-Oct-18 10:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 are stable at 700ish most people say. My batch 2 is stable at 625, and I run a batch 3 at stock because my `curl` trick no longer works there

[22-Oct-18 10:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you don't plan to overclock, buy a batch 3 游땎

[22-Oct-18 10:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
will be cheaper for you, because batch 1 come at a premium, i would guess

[22-Oct-18 10:22 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll wait for the next batch of z9

[22-Oct-18 10:22 PM] SHossain#0007

@SHossain i am allergic to tariffs and researching GPU mining rigs now

[22-Oct-18 10:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ryzen 7 2700 is a sweet spot for cost per MH/s

[22-Oct-18 10:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
about 70 cents per MH/s for a functional bare-bones (and I do mean bare-bones) rig, if somebody can beat that, I want to know

Hello, I'm trying dstm , bminer, and I've used password=anything and password=x but still receive  "Get error: Authorization failed, resetting in 5 seconds " - I'm using Agama to create Pirate z address. Could someone please advise what else I could try? Thanks

[22-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Louis#8450
With Agama wallet must I wait until the wallet is synced before Pirate receiving address (z) is activated? Thnaks

[22-Oct-18 11:14 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[22-Oct-18 11:19 PM] Louis#8450
Hello sHossain - many thanks for your reply, to confirm I need to wait for block chain to sync before I can mine?

[22-Oct-18 11:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes

[22-Oct-18 11:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you cannot mine the proper block if you don't know what the proper block is

[22-Oct-18 11:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
every block is build ontop of the one before it

[22-Oct-18 11:21 PM] Louis#8450
Many thanks indeed ComputerGenie, for clarifying and detailing the reason, much appreciated 游땎

if you're mining at a pool, you don't need to wait

[22-Oct-18 11:21 PM] Alright#0419
only need to wait if you're solo mining

[22-Oct-18 11:22 PM] Louis#8450
https://piratepool.io says when  using the z address and password anything not authroised, I'll wait

[22-Oct-18 11:23 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
You can get your addy without being synced

[22-Oct-18 11:23 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[22-Oct-18 11:29 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
is piratepool.io @webworker01's pool?

[22-Oct-18 11:31 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@webworker01 Do you imagine if your getting started page didn't tell folks to use an R addy that less would do so?

Hi Miners, can anyone explain this apparent Nicehash nonsense? 
https://imgur.com/a/NMWtg3G

I have 2 orders, the 'standard' one has twice the hash and half the cash remaining compared to the 'fixed' one, yet both show the same estimated time. What gives?

their algo is to maximize their revenues, what else matters?

[23-Oct-18 06:09 PM] jansako#3330
well they won't me maximizing much from me any more... first and last 'fixed' order that I placed if that is the case...

[23-Oct-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
dont be so harsh, they need to have their "bugs" to maximize their profits

[23-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
@jansako don't ever try to make sense of what NH does

[23-Oct-18 06:18 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@jansako "remaining time" is the value of current hash cost / btc remaining

[23-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jansako#3330
right, so I would expect the fixed order, with a larger cost remaining and less hash being used to have a longer time remaining

[23-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the sooner it runs out the sooner you have to put more in

[23-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the nicehash percentage?

[23-Oct-18 06:19 PM] jansako#3330
5% when placing the order

[23-Oct-18 06:19 PM] jansako#3330
+ random fees for payouts, deposits & such

[23-Oct-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
5%??

[23-Oct-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
no wonder they do what they do

[23-Oct-18 06:20 PM] jansako#3330
yep, a 0.01 BTC order starts off as 0.095

[23-Oct-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
not exactly "random"

[23-Oct-18 06:42 PM] jansako#3330
Fees they charge you for various operations (deposit, withdraw, 'payout' if you are selling hash) seem random to me. I am sure they are all listed somewhere on page 683 of the T&C.  Yes, I admit it is my fault for not reading up on them beforehand.

[23-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jansako#3330
Not exactly complaining, but it is one of the reasons I stopped selling hash through them as a backup for MRR.

[23-Oct-18 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_stopped selling hash because solo mining pays more_

[23-Oct-18 06:46 PM] jansako#3330
So based on your experience, the fixed vs standard order performance is comparable? I can certainly understand that comparing two 'estimates' may not give 100% reliable results...

[23-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Hermes#6934
So you guys use Alibaba?

[23-Oct-18 06:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
If you "babysit" your order, standard will always be cheaper; "fixed" = you pay a premium for "set it and forget it"

[23-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Hermes#6934
