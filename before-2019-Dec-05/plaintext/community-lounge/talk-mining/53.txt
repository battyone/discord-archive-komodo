👍🏼 that's why we're all here

[09-Oct-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@$tefano. Given current pricings and half the wattage, I think you just talked me into buying a few A9s

[09-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Mark81#4505
yep!

[09-Oct-18 02:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not opposed to adding new coins, it just hasn't really been a priority for me tbh. 

I tried adding MGNX the other day, but it was having some errors, so I disabled it until I get around to figuring out what's wrong with it. 

I added CALL a few weeks back when the dev asked me and no one at all used it for like 2 weeks so I took it off for now

[09-Oct-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@xRobeSx Unless you're staking with the same node, there shouldn't be any MGNX issues

[09-Oct-18 02:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yea I used to have MGNX v1 and v2 working fine, I think its just something weird I missed between all the versions.

[09-Oct-18 02:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Overall my point is, no one really even uses my pool for KMD as it is. So I don't really have much interest in other coins unless people really express interest that it will be used @Mark81

[09-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Mark81#4505
Aah! Ok so you are already onto it. Yeah i think its just could be nice to have one pool for komodo ecosystems coins without any husshle to set your own pools to be able mine with gpu..

[09-Oct-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't mined it since PIRATE went to dPoW, but the komodod from the pull the day before that worked like a dream

[09-Oct-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other than out of mem error when staking, I don't think I ever had any issue with MGNX

[09-Oct-18 03:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
komodod isn't the issue, it was something pool related specifically for MGNX which made me think it's something to do with the db carrying over from the v2 or whatever

[09-Oct-18 03:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I honestly couldn't really be bothered at the time, I simply did MGNX `enabled=False` hah

[09-Oct-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to setgenerate true 1

[09-Oct-18 03:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
trust me, i had

[09-Oct-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[09-Oct-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
false works now too

[09-Oct-18 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
james changed the default in komodo a while back

🤔 

[09-Oct-18 03:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I ran into that issue when I first tried adding mgnx v1 @blackjok3r 😃

[09-Oct-18 03:02 PM] Mark81#4505
when those error were shown?

[09-Oct-18 03:03 PM] Mark81#4505
right on launch or when work was put on that coin?

[09-Oct-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the out of mem error is/was sporadic, mostly dependent on how many UTXOs you have

[09-Oct-18 04:34 PM] Resistor#1215
could somoene join me in voice channel i have some questions. . for people who have mined and traded ...

so if i want to use a different pool i just change the port, right? sorry im a newb

[10-Oct-18 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure.. .I solo mined it

[10-Oct-18 10:47 AM] юрий#6665
HOW CAN YOU RECEIVE A MACHINE MANETA PIRATE? IT HAS YOU CHANGED ON KMD ON A COURSE, 1A THEN IS SOLD ON THE EXCHANGE, RIGHT

[10-Oct-18 01:24 PM] wookie#7663
I'm considering getting a z9 or z9mini for "hobby" mining. I've never used these miners before. I've watched a bunch of youtube videos and read some websites, one question I can't find an answer to is: is it possible to use a vpn to route the data?

[10-Oct-18 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anything is possible, but why would you want to?

[10-Oct-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you want *less* hops, not more

[10-Oct-18 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't think they care about VPNs, but latency matters

[10-Oct-18 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
slow internet is worse for mining, fast internet is good

[10-Oct-18 01:30 PM] wookie#7663
the internet I go through has blocked me from mining before

[10-Oct-18 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, well then

[10-Oct-18 01:30 PM] wookie#7663
so I have a vpn on my gpus now

that piece of software is art, a full blown vpn in a single python app, can do tcp/udp/dns and more

[10-Oct-18 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i often use it to tunnel all my traffic thru a remote server

[10-Oct-18 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
say you are getting blocked because of your country from a website .... perfect use case there 😃 And your use case, it tunnels all traffic over ssh, so screw the people filtering your internet

[10-Oct-18 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are people here much more knowledgeable than me, but basically, the z9m is just a linux box. You can ssh into it

[10-Oct-18 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
it gets a DHCP IP address by default

[10-Oct-18 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
but as long as it has internet somehow, it doesn't care

[10-Oct-18 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
all it cares about is sending hashpower to a pool URL

[10-Oct-18 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the z9m is just a linux box. You can ssh into it`
more specifically a nix box running cgminer (well a bastardized version of it anyway)

[10-Oct-18 01:35 PM] wookie#7663
thanks, will definiitely take a look!

[10-Oct-18 05:16 PM] 7seas0311#7197
Is there a list of KMD mining pools here in the discord?

[11-Oct-18 11:22 AM] barv#0867
what is the best project to do some cpu mining on? I have a spare cpu this month. Or is it just a waste of time?

[11-Oct-18 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in a month of time, depending on the CPU, you might have some luck with VRSC
beyond that, maybe pick a low diff asset chain

[11-Oct-18 11:24 AM] barv#0867
Nice. I hoped, but figured vrsc might already be too difficult

[11-Oct-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, that's why I said "some luck", for the CPUs I have VRSC has been over in the CPU range for quite some time

[11-Oct-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh my GPU made more in 1 day on VRSC (and it wasn't even an impressive amount) than my CPU did in a month

[11-Oct-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what I get for buying weak CPUs 😛

can someone modify z9 mini to mine VRSC? :trollface:

[11-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, but not at anything worth a damn 😛

[11-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
computer-on-a-chip has minimal computing power

[11-Oct-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
RYZEN 2700X is getting a block of VRSC a week... at 4.175GHZ 1.35v

[11-Oct-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
motherbvoard is too shit to go higher, it just locks up, but as it is thats at 70C.. in summer here it will be near 80C

can i mine KMD with the GPU of my  pc?

[11-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Hermes#6934
Yeah you will have to find a pool

[11-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Hermes#6934
but still is profitable I think

[11-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Hermes#6934
just gonna start mning today

[11-Oct-18 06:41 PM] modereck#4269
I never mined, how can i start? i will burn my graphic card?

not sure if it's power supply

[12-Oct-18 12:49 AM] Hermes#6934
but my firmware is from August so it should work

[12-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Hermes#6934
is like it doesn't let you do it

[12-Oct-18 01:25 AM] gt#2812
loading  the old firmware did the trick

[12-Oct-18 01:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hermes It's more than likely a shit chip on that board. None of the new batches are near as strong and stable as batch 1.
