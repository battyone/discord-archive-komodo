I have the private key... I just really really dont want to import a rivkey full of dust into a deamon.

ahhhhhh, so in other words you cheated the system üòõ

because I'm greedy like that, there will likely be few mine-on-demand chains left after Sept

since htat public pool went live, the number of AC notarizations has gone through the roof.

My consolidation script is to fire up the stratum address on another PC every couple of days & send the 'harvest' out 0.05 at a time :-).

[30-Jul-18 10:40 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie you expect your script to be more responsive than the one someone else has been running for some time now? (I can usually catch  one o the blocks if I send out a 'cheap' chain TX first, then another 'expensive' chain right away)

[30-Jul-18 10:41 AM] jansako#3330
Did I just make your decision tree twice as complex, or did you already factor the 'value' of a chain in?

[30-Jul-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jansako I'm not sure I follow what you're asking

[30-Jul-18 10:41 AM] jansako#3330
someone else is already running a script that puts a hash into an AC if a tx is detected in the mempoo

[30-Jul-18 10:41 AM] jansako#3330
l

[30-Jul-18 10:41 AM] jansako#3330
I 'assume' that is what you are working on too?

[30-Jul-18 10:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ahh, yes

[30-Jul-18 10:42 AM] jansako#3330
so how is yours going to be better besides me having to try to trick 2 bots instead of one?

[30-Jul-18 10:44 AM] jansako#3330
maybe I will just make sure the auto-payout on my stratum is run exactly at the same so it generates a tx in 6 chains at the same time üòÉ

[30-Jul-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, for one, I'm personally going to have a ton of Z9minis (more than enough to dedicate 1 per chains)
beyond that, I'm looking at making a "profit switcher" that's based both on coin price as reported by mm and any transactions in the mempools

[30-Jul-18 10:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
higher price + lower diff = bettter .... etc

[30-Jul-18 10:45 AM] jansako#3330
a z9 per chain,  that for sure means bye-bye for GPU ac mining

[30-Jul-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could you not detect the mempool TX on KMD, and flood hash on that to mine huge interest blocks?

[30-Jul-18 10:46 AM] jansako#3330
hope you can eat the cost of that mining for a while, or do you expect actual liquidity to come to the chains?

[30-Jul-18 10:46 AM] jansako#3330
soon (tm)

[30-Jul-18 10:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the shortest answer is that it will work akin to "weighted averages" in math
a waiting tx gets the most weight
then comes "personal preference" ( I like SN, the next guy likes DEX...)
then comes "profitability"
lastly, all other things being equal, all hash goes to KMD

[30-Jul-18 10:49 AM] jansako#3330
@blackjok3r I would think that is risky cause you never know how fast that block gets mined...

[30-Jul-18 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jansako I made my profits for this year in Dec of last year

[30-Jul-18 10:49 AM] jansako#3330
üòÉ

[30-Jul-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the blocks cannot be faster than 60s by notaries...

[30-Jul-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so if you put more hash than the diff to make a block in less than 60s you would get the large itrest block 100% of the time

[30-Jul-18 10:51 AM] jansako#3330
yes, but the huge tx could come in 10 sec before the block is found no?

[30-Jul-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
provided you got the TX fast enough

[30-Jul-18 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've been ultra lucky in mining and could never start today and duplicate my "success" because of certain events that happened in the last 2 years in crypto

[30-Jul-18 10:52 AM] jansako#3330
Thanks guys, workout time... gotta bail!

[30-Jul-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
--------------------------------------
`yes, but the huge tx could come in 10 sec before the block is found no?`
it will not be something that "turns on a dime" for many different reasons, but it will scrape the mempools quite often

[30-Jul-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's far from a "low overhead" system

[30-Jul-18 10:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I literally started this monstrosity that I now have with 1 GTX 1080 that I could barely afford to buy üòé

[30-Jul-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and now my per-order import "brokerage" fees are more than that cards üòõ

[30-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Was it hitting a monsterblock for kmd? üòÑ

[30-Jul-18 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Cryptoon no, I actually started out in Stanford's distributed computing project, it paid out in FLDC and CURE, and they both mooned at a really good time for me

[30-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sweet

[30-Jul-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, then I got more cards and equihash became profitable

[30-Jul-18 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
then last May-July brought a ton of unexpected income on top of it all

[30-Jul-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Ironically, I have so little liquidity that the one "monsterblock" that I did hit went into car repairs on wife's car üòõ

[30-Jul-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The real question is why they'd ever release ASICs to the public....

[30-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Every time they have a new generation for themselves, they use the more efficient ones for themselves

[30-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Limited power supply or so?

[30-Jul-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm still waiting for someone to tell me why they'd invest 5-10 million USD to design a chip and **not** use it for themselves

[30-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They use it first for themselves and when they are paid back and then some for the development of a new chip they sell it to the public and use the new chip?

[30-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They probably figure that after x months/years these chips also start showing wear/tear

[30-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So better to sell them as 'new' and leave the risk of a faulty product to the customer that buys them

[30-Jul-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no clue on the actual numbers, but from a business standpoint, I can't see why that wouldn't be the way to go

[30-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can see a case for both

[30-Jul-18 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
even "non-profits" exist for the sole function of earning as much income as possible

[30-Jul-18 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
99% of bitching about BM comes from people that are just pissed because they are making pennies for every $1000 BM makes üòõ

[30-Jul-18 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ask one of them feks if they had 10 million USD to design a chip, would they release it to market with 0 pre orders and 0 self-interest usage
all of the ones that say "yes" are all of the ones that have never been and will never be in a successful managerial position üòâ

[30-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh

[30-Jul-18 02:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would do indeed exactly the same

[30-Jul-18 02:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maximise profit and they will keep doing this untill an incumbent enters the market and threatens their profitability

[30-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As you say, untill someone steps up and coughs up the money to develop a new chip

[30-Jul-18 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbh, if it were me (like I said initially), I'd make the damn chips and sit back and collect my billions of every algo and say fek the public

[30-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But then they would destroy the ecosystem they are making money off of

[30-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So they need other miners to also support price for for example btc or whatever

[30-Jul-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not really, I mean we still mine KMD knowing that at best we can only get a max of 36% between us on a good day

[30-Jul-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
look at the bottom end ot top 20 BTC pools:
`17     CKPool     0.64 %     269.64 PH/s     
18     KanoPool     0.64 %     269.64 PH/s     `
That represents quite a few people looking for their "piece of the pie" knowing that there's really a nominal chance of getting any "big" payout

[30-Jul-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if BM kept all their own stuff, those 2 pools alone would be ~ 45k Avalon units

[30-Jul-18 03:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm that's a lot, but still, it's not like they can keep adding miners to their pool untill they stop working

[30-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As I said, after a while electricity consumption and other logistical stuff becomes an issue I can imagine

[30-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, they are making millions upon millions upon millions, they probably have a good view over the operation/ecosystem and found the equilibrium that maximises long term profits?

[30-Jul-18 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
given how much pressure I'm told they impart on suppliers and transport lanes, I'm not sure "equilibrium" is anything that even enters into the equation; more like "How much can we do before more people start bitching again?"

the only parameter that defines someones succes in mining is the price of electricity.. to let run some gpu or asic is childplay.
unfortunatly that parameter works against my mining ambition .. therefor selling all rigs by end of year.
has been interesting.

[30-Jul-18 04:26 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
yeah bye.. no point to lose money

[30-Jul-18 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you're loosing $ mining equihash, even in the current "down" market, then you couldn't afford to be mining in the 1st place

[30-Jul-18 04:29 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
i pay 0.35$/kwh that draws a line in the sand.. no mining for you 
only Ethash is somehow netting just over breakeven.

[30-Jul-18 04:29 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
and i pay in ‚Ç¨ üòÇ

[30-Jul-18 04:31 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
So.. your elec bill defines the mining succes.. nothing else

[30-Jul-18 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
even at 35 cents, if you're not big enough to be making $5 a day, then (as I said) you couldn't afford to be mining in the 1st place

[30-Jul-18 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
scale determines success, because that's how business operates with large overhead

[30-Jul-18 04:37 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
true.. i only bought for 10k‚Ç¨ hardware.. so stupid.. but selling everything would return a lot..

[30-Jul-18 04:39 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
a 200 to 250k‚Ç¨ initial investment for hardware AND have cheapest elec would be a good step.

[30-Jul-18 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure how you spent $11712 and are operating at a loss üòï

[30-Jul-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lemme guess, you mine in a pool and give your profits away?

[30-Jul-18 04:40 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
a single 1070 was at it cheapest here 469‚Ç¨
a single 1060 at 299‚Ç¨

[30-Jul-18 04:40 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
i only mine in pools yes.. too small for solo mining realy

[30-Jul-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ahh, so you invested badly to start with

[30-Jul-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and then compounded it by giving $ away

[30-Jul-18 04:41 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
i know everything is cheaper in US.. here in europe it is realy the cheapest cards

[30-Jul-18 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
anything short of a 1080 was a waste of investment

[30-Jul-18 04:41 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
not realy
