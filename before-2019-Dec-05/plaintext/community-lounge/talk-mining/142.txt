then when it solves we get a much more meaningful onchain diff than the current gradually increasing diff

[03-Aug-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
even if we 10x it, if there is 10000x the hash, it still finds a block in a second and we emitted coins we didnt have to

[03-Aug-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe calculate the max possible hashrate, based on recent blocks

[03-Aug-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
exponentially decay from that, to the current calc

[03-Aug-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the estimate is above the actual hashrate, then we can get a real valid diff sample

[03-Aug-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
which will then make the estimate for the max possible hashrate more accurate, though maybe we double it as we are dropping exponentially back to normally increasing diff

[03-Aug-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
and not much harm in overestimating the max possible hash

[03-Aug-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the question is, based on current solve times, how to calculate the max possible implied hashrate

[03-Aug-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
well all denominated in bnTarget

[03-Aug-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I am viewing the time less than expected for the recent blocks as a resource that we really want to spend. and the best usage of that is to get as close to the real hashrate as possible with the next sample. not sure on the math of how to calibrate the exponential decay to use up as close to all the time possible on the next block. but we now can temporarily have very large difficulty, but still decay it fast enough so it can be solved normally

[03-Aug-19 08:29 PM] zawy#5864
Just thinking out loud......
if sum last 3 block < 0.2xT then bnTarget = (bnTarget \* min(1000, 1000*tipdiff/180)) / 1000;

[03-Aug-19 08:30 PM] zawy#5864
to be done at very end, after min()

[03-Aug-19 08:31 PM] zawy#5864
sum 3 blocks < 0.2T is almost 3 blocks behind, so don't let anyone have a block for 3 minutes even if they have the hashrate the SMAs have estimated.

[03-Aug-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but SMA estimate is how close to reality?

[03-Aug-19 08:32 PM] zawy#5864
close.....it's always an underestimate

[03-Aug-19 08:32 PM] zawy#5864
by those factors

[03-Aug-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
at first, it will be grossly underestimating as it only has the most recent low diffs

[03-Aug-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so 17 blocks zoom by

[03-Aug-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we need a time based estimate, which will naturally decay as time passes

[03-Aug-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
need to overestimate

[03-Aug-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
then let the decay find the actual

[03-Aug-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what i see when CPU is mining

[03-Aug-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the mult value ticks up each second, but until it is easy enough, nothing happens

[03-Aug-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
same thing, just in reverse

[03-Aug-19 08:35 PM] zawy#5864
tipdiff is decaying

[03-Aug-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes but above is max of 180x, right?

[03-Aug-19 08:35 PM] zawy#5864
yes, in 4th block of the attack

[03-Aug-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
too slow

[03-Aug-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
10 blocks almost for free and this extra coin emission cant be recovered

[03-Aug-19 08:36 PM] zawy#5864
let me run the test

[03-Aug-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
can we use all extra time, start at crazy high diff, exponentially decay down to normal, with 10 seconds left in the budget

[03-Aug-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
like a Sphygmomanometer

[03-Aug-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
where the high pressure is the higher than blood pressure diff

[03-Aug-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is released until it can be solved. then immediately we have a valid estimate of actual hashrate, on block 4

[03-Aug-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe only 3 easy blocks are lost, regardless of how much hashrate. since we recover in 5 blocks, but 10 to 15 minutes, the coin emission is preserved

[03-Aug-19 08:39 PM] zawy#5864
600 seconds to get 5 blocks

[03-Aug-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so we can lose only 5 fast blocks

[03-Aug-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i know this is close to impossible, yet it shouldnt be impossible

[03-Aug-19 08:41 PM] zawy#5864
I'm saying that's the result of my test

[03-Aug-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
oh! thats a perfect match

[03-Aug-19 08:41 PM] zawy#5864
100000 can't get the 6th block in less than 10 minutes

[03-Aug-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
```if sum last 3 block < 0.2xT then bnTarget = (bnTarget * min(1000, 1000*tipdiff/180)) / 1000;```

[03-Aug-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that?

[03-Aug-19 08:41 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[03-Aug-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so calculate this after the min() triggers

[03-Aug-19 08:42 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[03-Aug-19 08:43 PM] zawy#5864
this is crazy shit ðŸ˜ƒ

[03-Aug-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
before the averaging with prior bnTarget

[03-Aug-19 08:43 PM] zawy#5864
no, after

[03-Aug-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[03-Aug-19 08:44 PM] zawy#5864
but it needs some work.  An attacker will just make sure it's 4 seconds per block  to avoid this trigger

[03-Aug-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[03-Aug-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why i had multiple boosters

[03-Aug-19 08:44 PM] zawy#5864
it needs a single function

[03-Aug-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
its ready

@SHossain up for another test? a single ASIC can test whether we can slow it down or not

[03-Aug-19 08:58 PM] SHossain#0007
sure. updating

[03-Aug-19 08:58 PM] hellcatz#5825
i got x2 Z9M ready to go... (~30Ksol)

no other nodes on network. setting up 2nd node

[03-Aug-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
just start with ASIC whenever ready. i got the 15 CPU threads to trigger the new booster, but it never found any blocks

[03-Aug-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
my 210 node is online

[03-Aug-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
there should be 2 nodes now

[03-Aug-19 09:00 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. i have 2 as well

[03-Aug-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
@zawy with trigger at 0.2T, it will only delay it for 12 seconds per block

[03-Aug-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it solves the much higher diff...

[03-Aug-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure a one size fits all will catch all the cases

[03-Aug-19 09:04 PM] SHossain#0007

maybe your boost is blocking mine

[03-Aug-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i only implemented your boost

[03-Aug-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i took mine out

[03-Aug-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the boost is working

[03-Aug-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but diff isnt increasing as the blocks are too slow

[03-Aug-19 09:08 PM] SHossain#0007
single CPU thread shows over 2 sol/s

[03-Aug-19 09:08 PM] zawy#5864
is it being hit with high HR?

[03-Aug-19 09:08 PM] SHossain#0007
only 10k sol from my miner

[03-Aug-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe ASIC is slow to ramp up?

[03-Aug-19 09:09 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, fan speed is slow as i hear

[03-Aug-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810

for a single mini, thats too high, isnt it?

[03-Aug-19 09:10 PM] SHossain#0007
i thought hellcatz will join
