the ./genscript.sh didn't run so i used the templates to create the json files

[01-Mar-19 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK what is your coins/supernet.json?

[01-Mar-19 02:29 PM] figgy132#7531
how can i paste in here in a block (so it's no a mess)?

[01-Mar-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah just type
\`\`\`
stuff
\`\`\`

[01-Mar-19 02:31 PM] figgy132#7531
``` {
    "name": "supernet",

    "algorithm": "equihash",

[01-Mar-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that should work, but try
```JSON

I can dl webbys pool and see what I can see, but it'll likely take me an hr or so to sync SN chain

[01-Mar-19 02:36 PM] figgy132#7531
no worries, i'm out for a wee while anyway - thanks the help 😃

to use gencgf.sh the daemons need to be running, and I dont think it works for KMD.

is this a config problem or just someone getting a block before this pool submits it?

@Zafer you can use nicehash.com or miningrigrentals.com on basically any KMD mining pool

you shouldnt need to take it offline to run that RPC

[06-Mar-19 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just merge any utxo over X confirms into one using z_mergetoaddress and run the RPC

[06-Mar-19 06:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works for alll nodes that do lots of transactions...

[06-Mar-19 06:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you shouldnt need to take it offline to run that RPC`
No, but since I hadn't set up more than 1 node in config, I have to shut down to *add* that RPC

anybody have recommendations for exhaust fans, which will be installed on a wall to push heat out?

[07-Mar-19 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless that wall is 10+ feet high, I recommend roof exhaust

[07-Mar-19 05:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is a beast, for 1500 sq ft. I am dealing with 100sq ft and it must be on a wall, about ~9ft high near the interior roof line

[07-Mar-19 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have been reading a lot about hot isle containment, that datacenter people write about. It's fascinating stuff

[07-Mar-19 05:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
so the plan is to suck in cold air from under the building at the floor, and push the hottest air out at the top near the roof line

[07-Mar-19 05:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
and i will have some kind of tent/containment system to isolate hot exhaust air and funnel it up and out

[07-Mar-19 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
it can easily get 110F outside here, and unfortunately my structure gets full sun during part of the day. Heat is my biggest issue

[07-Mar-19 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when I started, it was a 6'x12' room with 1 for intake and 1 for exhaust :troll:

[07-Mar-19 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am dealing with 8x14'

[07-Mar-19 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
but before amps or physical space, or ethernet ports, cooling is my biggest limiting factor

[07-Mar-19 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I like the idea of using floor air, but my personal building is on a slab ☹

[07-Mar-19 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i must lock down a better cooling system before i can scale up

[07-Mar-19 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i never insulated the floor of this structure, so it has very accessible cool air, that I can suck up thru the floor, into miner intake fans

[07-Mar-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sweet

[07-Mar-19 05:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
i plan to suck in air on the north side as well, to get the coldest air from under the building

[07-Mar-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the key to remember that exhaust volume is pretty much the main importance

[07-Mar-19 05:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
how do i calculate how much CFM exhaust I should have?

[07-Mar-19 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when the room isn't cooler than outside, you need more 😛

[07-Mar-19 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's sheets of math that one can use, but that's what I stick with

[07-Mar-19 06:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most of the time, in summer, my intake side is 10F cooler than outside and output is 10F higher
