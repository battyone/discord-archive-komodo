`http://chickenpool.com/stats` <- up working, and has payments 
`https://github.com/TheComputerGenie/s-nomp` <- has the proper configs to not error and accept blocks (will check sprout to sapling transition in the am)

[04-Dec-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does a test chain need -ac_sapling= set ?

[04-Dec-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to say anything about it ?

[04-Dec-18 02:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I see s-nomp has the same hardcoded malady left from z-nomp where stats shows 'of 100' rather than whatever config has (will fix that tomorrow)

[04-Dec-18 03:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./komodod -ac_name=SPLTEST -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &`
or
`./komodod -ac_name=RKT -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 &`
were the 2 stated
as far as any other, test whatever you can

[04-Dec-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem so ... its just that before I saw there was a print on start about sapling height/timestamp that is now gone ... I used custom daemon with my own time stamps a few hours aart for sctivation and deadline

[04-Dec-18 03:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not gone, you just didn't scroll to the right placehttps://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/456900588018597918/519309054992973824

[04-Dec-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did that

[04-Dec-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no sapling print on daemons start

[04-Dec-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
investigating .. .found another bug with my code testing this though, which is good... nice easy fix too.

[04-Dec-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems the stratum needs some kind of special sapling root calcuation, so I cant claim that bounty

[04-Dec-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🥉

[04-Dec-18 03:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Is that your way of saying I was right and you were wrong? :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hashreserverd needs to be included ... the old stratum simply ignores it

[04-Dec-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the coinbase tx is right

[04-Dec-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but there is an extra key/value in the getblocktemplate

[04-Dec-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that the pool ignores

[04-Dec-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you make it not ignore it

[04-Dec-18 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just sayign I cnat take the bounty as my pool didnt work with sapling

[04-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should have done this ysterday but litteraly spent the entire day basically alseep... felt like death ... fuckin 99% humidity and 40 degrees C and raining out of no where after no hot weather, knocked me around it seems ...

{Reactions}
☹ 

[04-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
air con doesnt even work in those conditions... its just HOT!

[04-Dec-18 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll trade you, it's like 40F here ⛄

[04-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```// sapling needs this!
    if (rpcData.finalsaplingroothash) {
        this.hashReserved = util.reverseBuffer(new Buffer(rpcData.finalsaplingroothash, 'hex')).toString('hex');
    } else {
        this.hashReserved = '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'; //hashReserved
    }```

[04-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to be what it was missing ..

[04-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
another thig where znpmp just assummed something and hardcoded all 0's

[04-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im with you we need a better startum. that isnt in JS btw ...

[04-Dec-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anything would be better than JS

[04-Dec-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That did the trick

[04-Dec-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was just missig hashreserved

[04-Dec-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I added hashreserved

[04-Dec-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and now it works

[04-Dec-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks @webworker01  I stole the code from your commit 😄

[04-Dec-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dint need the rest though... only the hash reserved

[04-Dec-18 04:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
using nodejs, in and of itself, isn't so much the issue as all of the base code is written for nodejs v0.10 (from like 2014) and no one has taken the time to properly code fekall (it's just a massive bunch of cobbling more and more shit onto more and more shit

[04-Dec-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should offload all the heavy lifting into daemon RPC calls and code it in bash :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 04:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Should offload all the heavy lifting into daemon RPC calls and code it in bash`
don't think that hasn't crossed my mind 😛

[04-Dec-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Knomp works... with all KMD AC now... at least with my "hak"

[04-Dec-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well we should do that then

[04-Dec-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im down

[04-Dec-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of sucks web spent al that time on Knomp tho

[04-Dec-18 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well guess you got paid for it

[04-Dec-18 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so maybe not

[04-Dec-18 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pirate liekte rest of usa

[04-Dec-18 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im still iving off that money 😄

0.02 here

😦

`i at least made knomp work with node 10.x`
a Ferrari works with a 4 cylinder engine, 1 chevy door, 1 ford door, and a hood from a dodge truck too, but that doesn't mean you want one of them either

[04-Dec-18 04:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just once, I'd like to see one of these forks use imports rater than requires and any use of modern, efficient code anywhere

[04-Dec-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so what is needed to do that ... coinbase we need to give a list of address's and %'s for the pool fee so it can build the coinbase in the way you guys like it ... but what else is the stratum doing to the block that adds the solution? I think doing that is more reverting to getwork lol

[04-Dec-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To stay compatible with the current mining software ... we need the stratum protocol in python, (which exists already right?)

[04-Dec-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess python would be the best way to go tbh

[04-Dec-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but what else is the stratum doing to the block that adds the solution?`
I'd swear I linked you to slush's writing on stratum protocol 🤔

[04-Dec-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes you did ... but I laready started with znomp and didnt read a lot of it

[04-Dec-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we need the stratum protocol in python`
and I linked you to that too

[04-Dec-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but Ive lost it 😃

[04-Dec-18 04:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
me: `I'd swear I linked you to slush's writing on stratum protocol`
.....
you: `and didnt read a lot of it`
🤦🏽 
take a moment to let that sink in....

[04-Dec-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was busy then... now Im trying to find things to do, seems like a reasonable thing to look into now .. if we cna make it better, but i dont want to spend a lot of time on somehting no body will use.

[04-Dec-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@webworker01  would there be any new vulnerabilities in Knomp now ?

[04-Dec-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from that info a week or so ago?

[04-Dec-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems like we should be moving away from nodejs to me?

[04-Dec-18 04:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`seems like a reasonable thing to look into now`
How dafuq was it not "reasonable" to look into how the protocol works **before** attempting to change it or tell me how I was wrong about it? 😣

[04-Dec-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not changing it ...

[04-Dec-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least I dot think I am...

[04-Dec-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just used a valid built tx instead of makign it again

[04-Dec-18 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to get a working pool as fast as possible ... now thats done... we can look at makeing it better

[04-Dec-18 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That I have time

[04-Dec-18 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
payouts also working here btw ...

[04-Dec-18 04:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the straum building the cb tx is **literally** part of the protocol

[04-Dec-18 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm why ?

[04-Dec-18 04:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because that's how protocols work...
the guy that writes them decides the rules

[04-Dec-18 04:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so: because, slush said so

[04-Dec-18 04:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so fuck slush ... we make our own, as long as its compatible with the mining software

[04-Dec-18 04:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no issue

[04-Dec-18 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
adding txs indide the daemon is shit load easier than doing it on java script wth hundreds of dependancies that you cant control or verify to be safe.

[04-Dec-18 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also can be written to be backwards compatible easy enough, as my current option already is.

[04-Dec-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That said, the pool still needs to verify the PoW etc ...

[04-Dec-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless we add an RPC to the daemon to do that ...

[04-Dec-18 04:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`...than doing it on java script ...`
Who told you js? you keep droning on about js, but no one said anything needed to be js; in fact, I even linked you to (and have said this a dozen times) the perfect model of a stratum in python

[04-Dec-18 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does that have the correct deps for equihash etc though?

[04-Dec-18 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I figured eveyrone used NOMP because it worked...

[04-Dec-18 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can have a look at that python and see if I can offload all the heavy lifting directly to the daemon ... with verushash, we cna add more algos to AC's very easily

[04-Dec-18 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this seems like a good idea tbh

[04-Dec-18 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
saves having to modigy the pool deps for every algo

[04-Dec-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just add to the deamon

[04-Dec-18 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I figured eveyrone used NOMP because it worked...`
Everyone used NOMP because that many years ago the entire planet was all about "nodejs nodejs nodejs non-blocking nodejs nodejs nodejs non-blocking nodejs nodejs nodejs non-blocking ...."

[04-Dec-18 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it was the new toy

[04-Dec-18 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and it "stuck"

[04-Dec-18 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok ... well I dont want to argue about this... I want us to have the best soltion that doesn require shit load of fucking around and extra work, everytime something is added to komodod...

[04-Dec-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need a pool that "just works with komodod" no matter how may AC params are added to it.

[04-Dec-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I want us to have the best soltion that doesn require shit load of fucking around and extra work`
I've said a gajillion times, those are mutually *exclusive* things

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the best solution is to start something from the ground up and not use patched, chopped, and hacked to death shit scripts that barely work
which is why I started KEMP in the 1st place

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not writing an entire startum, I am the last person you wnat to do that..

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont be very good

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[04-Dec-18 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I am not writing an entire startum, I am the last person you wnat to do that..`
no one *ever* asked you to, in fact I've begged you to go away :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can however look at the python startum, and try removeing everything where it calls 3rd party deps, and offload them to the deamon, so it returns the correct data for the exact chain that is running every time.

[04-Dec-18 04:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
py isn't like node; there's not all that dependency shit

[04-Dec-18 04:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you should know that

[04-Dec-18 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
nodejs is garbage IMO

[04-Dec-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah but you still need to build CC txns in py ... that while being great to have is not somthign we can do, while the protocols are eveolving.
