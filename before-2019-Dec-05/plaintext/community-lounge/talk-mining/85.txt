Wasnt able to get my pool working with sapling payouts, over the change over.. Spent a fair few hours on it, and gave up. Seems like you 100% need to have a seperate sapling port, and there is no way to validate a zaddress via RPC.

[10-Dec-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto  Did you get that working? z address validation in nodejs?

[10-Dec-18 10:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Did you try incorporate both sprout and sapling payouts?

[10-Dec-18 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I started the chain on sprout and connected sapling address miners to it

[10-Dec-18 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once the address was valid after activation

[10-Dec-18 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just crasahed.

[10-Dec-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think most of my problems were not knowing how to setup a private chain mining pool.. Let alone use sapling.

[10-Dec-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as I can tell... just using a sapling address for the pools Z address, and NOT starting the pool, until after saplign si avtivated is the only way.

[10-Dec-18 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as sprout still works for a few months, this should be ok, just for pirate... pools can launch a new port for saping

[10-Dec-18 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt find it lol ...

[10-Dec-18 10:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
``` if (privateChain) {
                        pool.daemon.cmd('z_validateaddress',```
This what you're looking for?

[10-Dec-18 10:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Oh wait, you're using snomp, my bad

[10-Dec-18 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
web is there commits to your Knomp that are not showing ir something.... last one I could see was from like weeks ago?

[10-Dec-18 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No im kn a fork of webs

[10-Dec-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm didnt show at all for me.

[10-Dec-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Strange as It was there before .. .when I grabbed the code to make spling work on mine

[10-Dec-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh lol ok

[10-Dec-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might have another go at it tomorrow, but if yo have private chains wokring already, there isnt a lof o need... As ar as I know all PIRATE pools ar eon your repo anyway.

Thanks @Jules - coinblockers.com

[10-Dec-18 04:09 PM] hypocalese#3688
@SHossain  I had to add two commands after step 6.

[10-Dec-18 04:10 PM] hypocalese#3688
@SHossain 6a.   sudo apt install python-pip

[10-Dec-18 04:11 PM] hypocalese#3688
@SHossain  6b.  pip install cryptoconditions

[10-Dec-18 04:30 PM] hypocalese#3688
Another interesting thing.  I didnt notice this on the other nodes I updated however I am getting this message now.  Should I proceed or do I have to do something else?

[10-Dec-18 04:30 PM] hypocalese#3688
git reset --hard
HEAD is now at 5563cfeb3 resolve conflict

[10-Dec-18 05:34 PM] hypocalese#3688
figured it out.  Had to run 'git pull' after step 1.

[10-Dec-18 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007
the guide should work fine

[10-Dec-18 05:43 PM] hypocalese#3688
Didnt work

[10-Dec-18 05:44 PM] hypocalese#3688
take it or leave it

[10-Dec-18 05:44 PM] hypocalese#3688
just sharing my experience

[10-Dec-18 05:46 PM] SHossain#0007
which OS you are using?

[10-Dec-18 05:46 PM] hypocalese#3688
Ubuntu 18

[10-Dec-18 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll setup a fresh VPS now and test installing from fresh clone

[10-Dec-18 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
with Ubuntu 18

[10-Dec-18 05:47 PM] hypocalese#3688
i moved past these errors.  I was running a build from 2 months ago.

[10-Dec-18 05:47 PM] hypocalese#3688
My guess if you use a fresh build it will be fine.

[10-Dec-18 06:19 PM] Mend0z4s#1159
After fork will it change algo?

[10-Dec-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really

[10-Dec-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
On Dec. 1 they claimed ready to "take on Genesis mining" in an hr long "Can Digital Gold out last Genesis mining? " and 5 days later they are closing?
It's some 12' deep bullshit somewhere in that mix

[10-Dec-18 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from "ready to outlast Genesis" to "closing" __in 5 days__ is a **lot** more than "overextending"

dont do make clean after `git clean -f`

[11-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just git clean -f

[11-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then make

[11-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so when it does that error

[11-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just 
`git clean -f && make -j$(nproc)`

[11-Dec-18 10:52 AM] $tefano.#3560

@SHossain In my experience with CentOS by now, I learned that libraries on CentOS can be pretty old as they update it only with stable (maybe major versions). Here we have gcc error, so my first guess would be too old gcc.

[12-Dec-18 02:19 PM] enver#0753
Maybe try this firts before compile
