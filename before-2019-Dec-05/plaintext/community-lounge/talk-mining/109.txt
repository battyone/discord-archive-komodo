wait a second =) so, if net hash rate is `difficulty / blocktime`....

[20-Mar-19 05:58 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
and if we take these numbers here

[20-Mar-19 05:59 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ah, cannot post screenshot here ^^

[20-Mar-19 05:59 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902

Difficulty:
205,047,128.563

[20-Mar-19 05:59 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
Nethash:
54.68 Mh/s

[20-Mar-19 06:00 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
so, `205047128` should be divided by block time which is for KMD `62` seconds, right?

[20-Mar-19 06:00 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
and that should give us net hash rate

[20-Mar-19 06:00 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
which is apparently 54MH/s at the moment

[20-Mar-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
when i said hashrate to diff is non-linear, did you understand me?

[20-Mar-19 06:00 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
but `205047128/62=3307211`

[20-Mar-19 06:00 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
`3.3M` comparing to `54M`

[20-Mar-19 06:01 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@jl777c hm, well obviously not completely, sorry =))

[20-Mar-19 06:01 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
let me scroll back a bit

[20-Mar-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
being nonlinear means you can calculate it based on simple division

[20-Mar-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
please ignore diff, and just use Msols

[20-Mar-19 06:02 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
lol i definitely will do that =)) but i despite living in ignorance and just "use stuff as i'm told to" =) that's why i'm trying to explain this to myself

[20-Mar-19 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@БОМБ ОН diff/hash in CN coins is not quite the same as in BTC forks, is the first thing confusing you

[20-Mar-19 06:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@БОМБ ОН use your hashrate to calculate your % of network hashrate, then profit based on that. Difficulty is never involved

[20-Mar-19 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@БОМБ ОН another thing is that whattomine.com has KMD, but it doesn't take into account notaries getting 75% of block reward. So basically you can divide the whattomine rev/profit numbers by 4, since other miners get 25% of block reward

[20-Mar-19 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
so for KMD, you need to calculate that normal miners get 25% of block reward, on average

[20-Mar-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
you're sure about that duke?

[20-Mar-19 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe?

[20-Mar-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
divide by 4 thing

[20-Mar-19 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
depends where and when, order of operations matters

[20-Mar-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the effective hashrate would be accurate and alread includes notary

[20-Mar-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
Yea this is how I understood it

[20-Mar-19 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
profit calcuations for KMD on whattomine are not correct, I don't believe

[20-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Alright#0419
you can take that 56msol number and compare your hashrate against it

[20-Mar-19 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe that changed recently? Or maybe it's correct, and I am wrong

[20-Mar-19 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
whattomine doesn't take into account that only 25% of blocks can be mined at that diff

[20-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Alright#0419
Not sure, never used that, but that's always how I calculated it. I never paid close attention to it

[20-Mar-19 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
my miners default to KMD when I'm not using them for testing

[20-Mar-19 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is what it says for 3 z9 mini's on whattomine.com right now

[20-Mar-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
47Msols is a lot more than the sum of mining pools

[20-Mar-19 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
i was never sure if it took into account notary stuff

[20-Mar-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
almost like it is 4x the actual hashrate

[20-Mar-19 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
so the official answer is I am not sure. But don't use difficulty to calculate profit, it's based on hashrate not difficulty

[20-Mar-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure if you have 4.7Msols you would get 10% of the blocks and not 2.5%

[20-Mar-19 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
but if you had 4.7*3 Msols you would not get 30% of blocks

[20-Mar-19 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
because the max non-notaries can mine is 25% of blocks, I think. But I defer to James

[20-Mar-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if you start getting close to 25%, the effective hashrate will adjust

[20-Mar-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i meant that if you have 4.7Msols now when the nethash is 47

[20-Mar-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
not about adding 4.7, as if you add 4.7, overall nethash would go up by 18.8 Msols

[20-Mar-19 07:12 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@dukeleto tyvm kind sir!! what you said about my confusion is 100% right =)

[20-Mar-19 07:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
and as jl777 suggested, i definitely will use net sols from now on... i am still trying to figure out how comes that diff is never involved because i was sure that net hash rate and diff are in direct relation

[20-Mar-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
they are related, but nonlinearly

[20-Mar-19 07:18 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
also, thanks for clarifying about `whattomine.com` calculator, i thought i am doing something wrong here again ^^ but yeah, taking notaries in account (multiply by 0.25) seems like a correct thing...

[20-Mar-19 07:21 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@jl777c could you maybe explain me (in the simplest way possible) how does `komodod` calculate net sols which are returned in `getmininginfo` response?

[20-Mar-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a 2 hour average of the implied amount

[20-Mar-19 07:22 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
i'm sorry for being pain in the ass, if you don't like to go in circles with this, just tell me that i'm pain in the ass and i'll shut up =)

[20-Mar-19 07:23 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ah so it is averaging by some time, not using "expected block time"?

[20-Mar-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it used the expected time vs actual time and averages over 2 hours

[20-Mar-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the source code has the exact logic, i dont remember the details

[20-Mar-19 07:25 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ok, ok i see... does that mean it follows the similar equation like bitcoin? for example `hash_rate = (blocks_found/expected_blocks*difficulty * 2**32 / 600)`

[20-Mar-19 07:25 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
(2**32 being something with `nBits` i think)

[20-Mar-19 07:25 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
and ofc, different block time...

[20-Mar-19 07:26 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
let me try to dig around source code myself!

[20-Mar-19 07:27 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
thanks for being patient and helping out with understanding what i though will be a "simple" thing =)

[20-Mar-19 07:27 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
so naive... "simple" in crypto? yeah, sure ^^

[20-Mar-19 07:30 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
hm, think i found it

@БОМБ ОН zcash is a fork of btc 0.11.2, so unless somebody changed it, that is what we inherited from bitcoin. BUT, difficulty and hashrate are not related in the same way in Zcash world, i remember hearing about this

[20-Mar-19 08:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is some annoying factor to also multiply by, it's not just a normal ratio

[20-Mar-19 08:08 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@dukeleto yeah, that's what i was reading too, that magical number of 8192

[20-Mar-19 08:08 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
which brought even more confusion ^^

[20-Mar-19 08:08 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902

I did some looking, and it seems that if you want to use Difficulty you have to use the sol/block modifier of 8192.  SO the calculation seems to be   ( hashRate / ( difficulty * 8192 ) ) * 10  or hourly as    ( hashRate / ( difficulty * 8192 ) ) * 10 * 3600    Currently that ...

[20-Mar-19 08:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's related to a bitshift, something has the wrong number of zeros in it

[20-Mar-19 08:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
and the result, is that annoying conversion factor

[20-Mar-19 08:08 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ah right, so that's even something different

[20-Mar-19 08:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
2^13=8192

[20-Mar-19 08:09 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
yeah

[20-Mar-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
zex 2.5 minutew

[20-Mar-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
vs 1 minute blocktime

[20-Mar-19 08:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
i remember hearing zawy talk about how zcash difficulty number is broken, but not bitcoin, because of the way some hex value is defined in source code, that requires this conversion factor

[20-Mar-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
also the min diff is different with KMD

[20-Mar-19 08:11 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@jl777c yeah, you are right, block times are not even included in any calculations in this topic i linked...

[20-Mar-19 08:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@БОМБ ОН what is your end goal?

[20-Mar-19 08:11 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ok, well, i gave myself enough material for the whole night to read and understand =)

[20-Mar-19 08:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
you seem very motivated, that is good to see

[20-Mar-19 08:12 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@dukeleto creating extremely simple and not-necessarily extremely precise calculator for how much coins you can get with specific hash rate

[20-Mar-19 08:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
what level of math will be involved?

[20-Mar-19 08:12 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
working on some pools around, so i'd like to have that as a "feature"

[20-Mar-19 08:12 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
and it is "javascript" level of math :D

[20-Mar-19 08:12 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
lol

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
and how long do you expect linear interpolation to be useful? I ask that question very seriously and deeply, and a math nerd who deeply questions profit calculators

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
nothing too serious, really, just a rough estimation...

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can get instantaneous values, but they constantly change

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
"expect linear interpolation to be useful"?? let me try to translate this to simple words ^^

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
trying to predict the future of mining profit, it's like predicting the weather next month

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ah no, no, nothing of that sort

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
no predictions...

[20-Mar-19 08:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
just rough estimation based on current network state

[20-Mar-19 08:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
daily profit given current conditions?

[20-Mar-19 08:14 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
that's all

[20-Mar-19 08:14 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
yeah

[20-Mar-19 08:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, that is reasonable then. whattomine/coinwarz/etc

[20-Mar-19 08:14 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
yeah, nothing more complicated than that... even simpler...

[20-Mar-19 08:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
i would love to see something like you describe, for all zcash-world stuff, zec, kmd and all the forks and freaks
