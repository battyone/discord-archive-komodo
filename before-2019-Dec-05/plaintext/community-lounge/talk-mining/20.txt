Zcash probably has way more short term potential

[05-Jul-18 09:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I fully expect Komodo to come into it's own around 2021-2

[05-Jul-18 09:28 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Plus those are way too expensive

[05-Jul-18 09:28 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I can buy enough minis to match that hashpower at less than half the price... Oc'd minis hit 15-18k sol/s

[06-Jul-18 02:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the OC levels out at ~ 16.6

Hi all, I've got a question about mining reward. I was looking at notary nodes and found that one of them mined a block with ~9900 KMD reward. Anyone can explain it? Are the rewards not claimed redistributed?

[06-Jul-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol, I just answered that in general for you.

[06-Jul-18 01:00 PM] JackLeFou#3655
yes I was answering there XD

[06-Jul-18 01:00 PM] JackLeFou#3655
thanks m8!

[06-Jul-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there's any number of reasons

[06-Jul-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That particular block I was watching as I had just became and notary operator and there was quite a few over a day or so, then large volumes on exchanges not long after.

[06-Jul-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
many raw transactions will lack stamps to collect, be they from exchange or private

Ledger seems to be the culprit for those HUGE blocks.

[06-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Alright#0419
There is also an `-exchange` tag that exchanges may be using to explicitly not claim it

[06-Jul-18 01:54 PM] benohanlon#1119
if APW3++ is sold out but I can still buy the z9 mini - will it be a prob to buy that power supply somewhere else?

[06-Jul-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@benohanlon You can usually find server PSUs and breakout-boards all over the internet

[06-Jul-18 01:55 PM] benohanlon#1119

Yea when the next batch of z9 minis if you have GPU rigs you'll want to find another algorithm

[08-Jul-18 07:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
1 z9 mini is 24 1080tis at the wattage of 1

[08-Jul-18 08:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
*20-22 if full overclock and wattage of ~1.6-1.8 at that OC

[08-Jul-18 08:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Still a ton

[08-Jul-18 08:39 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's 15k~ with of graphics cards

[08-Jul-18 08:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ya, anyone that argues against ASICs and for GPUs in their stead that can't give you a **deep** technical reason most likely spends too much time on social media, has a personal animus for Bitmain (which is misplaced in the conversation to begin with), or both

[08-Jul-18 08:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Genie you better do atleast 20% ZEC :(

[08-Jul-18 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm always on the loosing side of the Law of Averages with ZEC and ZCL for some odd reason

[08-Jul-18 08:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Zcl was stupid I remember when it was 1-2 bucks then a shitfork get announced for a merge drop and it touches 200...

[08-Jul-18 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ZCL is more profitable than one might think üòâ

I'm glad it's around the equihash algorithm is a Goldmine.

hi guys

[09-Jul-18 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Since i did the coqui ANN there has been many people asking for what mining pool mines coqui

[09-Jul-18 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it seems like there is no official assetchains mining pool available

[09-Jul-18 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Do you guys think that a assetchains mining pool is a viable project?

[09-Jul-18 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
not really, 0.0001 rewards seem pretty small, but for high value coins it might be worthwhile

[09-Jul-18 01:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but since the blocks are on demand, the more usage a chain has, the more 0.0001 rewards miners can get

[09-Jul-18 02:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Too demanding/time consuming of a request but finding a way of merge mining assetchain coins would be sweet.

[09-Jul-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
mergemining requires changing the header and it is better to just do a mining rotation for chains with mempool, like decker has

[09-Jul-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Something like that was suggested already, it would be mad for scale chains, we could do some crazy numbers being able to use a single miner for X chains.

[09-Jul-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
In an "untouched by external miners" chain, mergemining would also defeat the benefits of self-mining your own on-demand transactions

[10-Jul-18 11:31 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie have you been testing your ac switching mining-thingie? I have seen some 'suspicious' üòÉ behavior, where I mine 10 or even 20 blocks in a row, but when I drop a tx or two into the mempool, suddenly someone else grabs that block... If it is not you, someone else may be on it too.

[10-Jul-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's decker

[10-Jul-18 04:56 PM] jansako#3330
thx. sending a tx on 2 chains right one after another seems to let me catch at least one of the blocks üòÉ Most of the time anyway...

[10-Jul-18 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
That's been happening for months

[10-Jul-18 06:28 PM] jansako#3330
could be, haven't noticed cause I have not been moving lots of little amounts manually for a while. is that why the mining rewards on assetchains went to shite some time ago?

[10-Jul-18 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and it's not a "tiny bit of hash" that he does it with üòõ

[10-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
He's been doing it for longer than you've been mining them

[10-Jul-18 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
he's scooped some of my COQUI tx even while I was mining it with 2.2K+ sols

[10-Jul-18 06:31 PM] jansako#3330
I get pissed and I point a z9 mini at an assetchain when moving my stuff... üòÉ

[10-Jul-18 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[10-Jul-18 09:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I doubt 100, but based on minis I'm thinking 65-70

[10-Jul-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but arent they evil? it will make you centralized

[10-Jul-18 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the price is just linear multiple of the mini?

`the price is just linear multiple of the mini?`
yeah, at that price-point they are quite underwhelming

[11-Jul-18 12:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I'm going to get both,  mini and full.  Full will have more longevity and with the possibility of OC  may perform very well.  Minis to space hashpowe over multiple coins

[11-Jul-18 12:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
And pools

[11-Jul-18 01:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@polycryptoblog I'm not sure that I agree with longevity, given chips per board. If 1 chip in a mini shits the bed, you are down 3 good chips; if 1 chips in a "full" shits the bed, you are down **7**

[11-Jul-18 01:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes ,  but if nothing shits the bed ,  you will be able to mine longer with the full.  Regardless,  point taken

[11-Jul-18 01:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Still not sure how you come to that conclusion

[11-Jul-18 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Care to share what metric you're using to determine "longer"?

[11-Jul-18 01:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The length of time that a given hashrates production covers its power cost

[11-Jul-18 01:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the hash and power and price are within nominal differences, so you're still not saying anything that would indicate "longer"

[11-Jul-18 01:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
40k sols @ 1200 watts is 40k sols @ 1200 watts

[11-Jul-18 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
beyond that, the "power cost" difference is $9 in cables
