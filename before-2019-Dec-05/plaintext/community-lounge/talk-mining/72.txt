need's to be donne at everry try

[19-Nov-18 08:27 AM] gigoplast#5562
no  way

[19-Nov-18 08:28 AM] gigoplast#5562
60 second with monitor pluged , is that a prob

[19-Nov-18 08:28 AM] gigoplast#5562
u can run 10 rig with 1 monitor

[19-Nov-18 08:30 AM] gigoplast#5562
u run first rig with monitor after 2 min u run the seconde with the first monitor unpluged from the rig 1 and so far ..

sry @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  i miss the reading from the Begin

Anyone in here know about O/Cing AMD cards in linux ... so far I have worked out most of it... but it doesnt seem my clocks are working.

[19-Nov-18 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I managed to use the 4.20 RC3 kernel to enable powerliit increase.

[19-Nov-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and have 1600MH/s on VerusHash on my Vega64 StriX ... but the temp is so low... it should be able to go a heap faster... unless the miner is miss reporting, the vega64 is almost 3x faster than an RX580 üòÆ

[19-Nov-18 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Think I figured it out ... seems you need to use the percentage OC rather than the clocks... Card seems overvolted from factory, so just rais powerlimit and then bump it by 1% at a time until it stops wokring ... I think it will cap out at about 1700MH/s VerusHash @ ~350w

[19-Nov-18 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mempory seems not to affect verus hash at all

[19-Nov-18 05:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gigoplast nope, some MB work just fine, but not others. Specifically, ASUS 450 seems to work, but not MSI

[19-Nov-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Duke just add a VEGA64 to each rig ... down volted they pull 1500Mhs at 200w ... much the same as a 2700x

[19-Nov-18 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely a 56 d the same ... and cost less

[19-Nov-18 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
picked mine up for $465 AUD in think USD thats liek $300...

[19-Nov-18 05:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r do you know your Hash/watt on that?

[19-Nov-18 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r and have you used a kill-a-watt to verify?

[19-Nov-18 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a watt metre on the wall

[19-Nov-18 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its includeing a laptop and 2 screens

[19-Nov-18 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can test it further and more accurate tomorrow and will ping you results 1am here lol

[19-Nov-18 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I defnatly know, its not worth OCing it

[19-Nov-18 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
70w more for 100mh

[19-Nov-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r 2700X's are just OC'ed 2700's from the factory üòâ

[19-Nov-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
same logic applies

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it kept getting suck in a lower power state of 200w in testing too, trying to oc it ... and that was 1500mh/s exactly

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
GPUs look shiny, but when I do the math, it doesn't work out. CPUs mine VRSC the best

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if you can get a very close hash per watt

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it amkes sense to save money

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and have a cpu and gpu on each motherbaord

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
especially wiht hte price of DDR4 LOL

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
GPUs don't compare, when you take into energy use. If you just want highest hashrate, GPUs are nice for that

[19-Nov-18 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is equal to ocd 2700x

[19-Nov-18 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
way way more than any other GPU ive seen in verus chat

[19-Nov-18 05:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
I can get really nice DDR4 for like $35USD, maybe you need a hookup?

[19-Nov-18 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1080tis are only 1100 ha/s

[19-Nov-18 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I cna under volt the shit out of this card and get 1500mh easy

[19-Nov-18 05:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
but divide by energy use, even TDP (not wall) and your hash/watt can't compare to CPUs

[19-Nov-18 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only had it a day ... didnt buy it for mining... but figured id try it out

[19-Nov-18 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, well that is a good score then

[19-Nov-18 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but total cost ... of system ... u have a slot, ram cpu motherboard ... all for each cpu

[19-Nov-18 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
add a vega56 to it

[19-Nov-18 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
more than double  the hash rate of the system

[19-Nov-18 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r oh i can does math üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
total cost of system is less than a used GPU with less hashrate

[19-Nov-18 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not here its not

[19-Nov-18 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
i agree to that. You might as well be on a different planet

[19-Nov-18 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I just got a really good deal on a vega ü§∑

[19-Nov-18 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same cost as the CPU alone here

[19-Nov-18 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no baord or ram

[19-Nov-18 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
your prices and availability to HW is totally different to me, in NA

[19-Nov-18 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but liek I said didnt buy it to mine with ... just figured id try it and was to say the least very surprised how many hash it pulls

[19-Nov-18 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
some GPUs get impressive hashrates

[19-Nov-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
think the trick was using linux 4.20 kernel and some hacked drivers ...

[19-Nov-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
everyone else is using mostly windows

[19-Nov-18 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think

[19-Nov-18 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
compilig MESA dev atm ... but its a really really big thing to compile .. taking hours even on this system üòÇ

[19-Nov-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, don't complain too much

[19-Nov-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326

[19-Nov-18 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when it fails at the tests section, and I had to start again, almost cried ...

compiling X windows, i must be a freak for having ever done that, but it was required for some crazy shit back in the day

[19-Nov-18 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did it on a imac g3 laptop ... only to have it refuse to run ... tookk 2.5 dyas running off a pair of car batteies

Hi guys. Does anyone have a sample how to change the file ,, start ,, in Claymore Zcash? I need an example of how to mine Pirate. Is there a screenshot?

[20-Nov-18 03:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'll make you one.   You're just talking about the .bat file to start the miner @Mixic ?

I think these portions are needed but I've never used Claymore so someone who has will have to chime in...

All that in one .bat file

[20-Nov-18 03:21 AM] Mixic#3188
Yes   I'm talking about the bat file. Thanks captain. That's what i need  @FishyGuts üëç

[20-Nov-18 03:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I believe there are specific settings for GPU.s But I am not familiar with them.  Perhaps the Bitcoin talk thread has more info you need.

You tipped @Mixic **9.9909 ARRR**
A network fee of 0.0001 ARRR was deducted from the amount.

I mine KMD. Now I turn to mining ARRR. Therefore, there were some minor difficulties with the .bat file.

[20-Nov-18 04:19 AM] bishop#9773

Guys, I need help. Now my friend wants to mine the Pirates, but he has an Nvidia GPU. Does anyone know which miner program is better suited for this?

[20-Nov-18 03:33 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
https://minethepiratechain.black/getting_started

I'd recommend EWBF's miner. Link and setup configuration are on that page :)

seem to be the same model style as the new ones,  so built in PSU

thinking of throwing a z9mini towards pirate why not...

pirate.black has all the pools listed @Portypete 
I am mining on piratechain.org to try and spread the hashrates.

Is ARRR trading on an exchange yet?

[21-Nov-18 05:29 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Sure is, this is pulled straight from the #pirate chanel.

DigitalPrice.io: https://digitalprice.io/?inviter=4fdaf7

Please use these ref links.   All proceeds will go towards pirate onboarding. 
Since we have no dev fund or premine, this will help tremendously.
