ok thanks

[14-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
didn't bother to play with the OC until now, trying to find a balance

[15-Sep-18 01:05 AM] Steve10#5203
Hi everyone I'm new to mining and just got a z9 mini. I'm trying to test it by mining kmd but I can't figure out how to set up my miner for miningpools.cloud. Their website is very confusing, any help would be appreciated, thank you

[15-Sep-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
You can just take the link and use it for URL, put your address for worker and anything for password

[15-Sep-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
Just took a look at their site, not sure which port they'd suggest for a z9 mini

[15-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
I know http://pool.komodo.services/stats has an ASIC compatible port. You could just do `stratum+tcp://stratum.komodo.services:3333` for URL

[15-Sep-18 01:15 AM] Alright#0419
and again, your kmd address for worker and anything for password

[15-Sep-18 04:04 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@Steve10 I’d be happy to have you mining on my pool that @Alright posted above 😃 there are some z9’s on there now. Just use the address he posted and you’ll be good to go!

[15-Sep-18 01:27 PM] Steve10#5203
@Alright  @xRobeSx thank you for the info. I got it set up last night for zcash. I'll mine that for a while and then maybe switch over and try kmd just to test it out. Looks like zec is the best financially right now. Might sell zec and just buy more kmd lol

[15-Sep-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is too OCD about daily blocks/coinage to mine ZEC_

[16-Sep-18 05:55 PM] $tefano.#3560
@Steve10 port is 4444 for info click on help page

[16-Sep-18 05:56 PM] $tefano.#3560
anyway mine on komodo.services so we can divide hashes between pools 👍

[16-Sep-18 09:23 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
Hello, I have a problem on a Komodo AssetChain. A miner rented about 20 Msol/s for 5 mins raising our difficulty to 1190428.129796985 (449.56 KSol/s). Our current hashrate is about 40ksol/s and now no blocks are being mined anymore by anyone according to https://call.explorer.mycapitalco.in/blocks Is there any way to low the difficulty?

[16-Sep-18 09:27 PM] PTYX#6840
is it proof of stake

[16-Sep-18 09:27 PM] PTYX#6840
or pow?

[16-Sep-18 09:35 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
Proof of Work

[16-Sep-18 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The diff is 2470.371022068 and it was an owned 500k for an hr not 20M rental for 5 minutes

[16-Sep-18 09:52 PM] Alright#0419
@adrian.marinescu is it still stalled?

[16-Sep-18 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just set a mini on it

[16-Sep-18 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to bring it back down

[16-Sep-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
@adrian.marinescu if you were to make the chain some % of POS, something like that would not stall the chain

[16-Sep-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
even 1% POS would prevent long stalls like that

[16-Sep-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
just need to make sure that someone is always staking

[16-Sep-18 09:55 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 The 20 Msol/s spike was recorded on the chart, but now it's not visible anymore as the incident happened 3 hrs ago (whel last block was mined)

[16-Sep-18 09:56 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@Alright I would prefer not to enable any PoS on the chain and keep it this way, but we are interested in a way to block these type of attacks in the future

[16-Sep-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
keeping hash rate on the chain

[16-Sep-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
or POS

[16-Sep-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
the more hash rate the chain has consistently, the less effective that would be

[16-Sep-18 09:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`@un Haiduc The 20 Msol/s spike was recorded on the chart`
@adrian.marinescu#0328  while that may be what you're seeing on your pool, there's more to a P2P network than just 1 node

[16-Sep-18 10:01 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I understand this, anyone on the network could have done this not just through our pool but now the network is stuck because of this. I want to ask you when the diff retarget would happen to restore the normal state of the network

[16-Sep-18 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
You could unstall it immediately with NH or just wait for @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 's minis to start finding blocks

[16-Sep-18 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, "normal" is going to be relative to if the 1 miner in your pool dedicates the 65k they were running  this morning or not

[16-Sep-18 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because of that miner, I had no qualms with backing off when I did

[16-Sep-18 10:23 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
Seems like the network returned to a normal state now, thank you for your support @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and @Alright

[16-Sep-18 10:25 PM] Alright#0419
ok, hopefully we can figure out how to prevent that @adrian.marinescu

[16-Sep-18 10:25 PM] Alright#0419
Was that someone acting maliciously or ignorantly?

[16-Sep-18 10:29 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@Alright We don't know yet, but I think someone messed up NiceHash order and that may have caused this. If so, I am sorry for his money because he haven't much CALL in this timeframe. I have his address, I don't know if it's ok to ban him or not for this

[16-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
can't really "ban" someone from using the network

[16-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
only reason I asked was because you should explain to that person what they just did

[16-Sep-18 10:31 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
He did that through our pool, that's why I am saying this

[16-Sep-18 10:31 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@Alright I can't find a way to reach him

[16-Sep-18 11:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Was that someone acting maliciously or ignorantly?`
None of the above

[16-Sep-18 11:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I mined ~5k in coins and when I decided to switch back to KMD, there was in excess of 70k in his pool so I didn't think it would be an issue to drop off

[16-Sep-18 11:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the still high diff is a result of the miner that then had 65+k now having less than 25k and the diff kickdown still hasn't kicked in

[16-Sep-18 11:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@adrian.marinescu the initial increase was **not** done through your pool and that 5 minute rental you saw in your graph was basically meaningless in the scope of what happened

[16-Sep-18 11:15 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Is your address: RLp5x6vENBM16weiwYc1C9XAbWQYrivYhW ?

https://call.explorer.mycapitalco.in/address/RVHBCXv4ThM3CXdTPct74uhXQ5duZAuNjd

[16-Sep-18 11:20 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
Then you don't know what I am talking about. If you want I will extract all datas from the database to explain the situation with precise info. In the beginning  this guy RLp5x6vENBM16weiwYc1C9XAbWQYrivYhW connected NH for about 3 minutes with 7 Msol/s, this didn't affect much the difficulty, but after several hours same guy connected NH with 20 Msol/s for 5 minutes raising the difficulty causing the situation. Trust me, I watched the pool activity today and I think he caused this. Maybe he mistakenly placed the order to high, maybe he wanted to hurt us. I don't know exactly, but if you know this guy: RLp5x6vENBM16weiwYc1C9XAbWQYrivYhW tell him to contact us

@adrian.marinescu We have reached the point where 1 of 2 things needs to happen....
1) you can accept the fact that I'm telling you that your wrong and I can prove it
or
2) I allow you to live in your delusion and send folks on a wild goose chase looking for solutions to the wrong problem
😣

[16-Sep-18 11:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The difficulty rose over a 1 hour-ish time period, was driven by my miners, and your pool had a minimal impact on the diff increase

[16-Sep-18 11:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you really need to have a record of what happened, I can trim my logs and show you tomorrow

[16-Sep-18 11:30 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 How much power have you connected to the network in the 1 hour period?

[16-Sep-18 11:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
~500k

[16-Sep-18 11:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
your pool counts for ~12% of the last 200 blocks

[16-Sep-18 11:33 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Thank you for your support, but please don't create this kind of diff waves in the future. I believe your words, I won't say anything else

[16-Sep-18 11:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
https://eu1.call.pool.mycapitalco.in/workers/RQfozSZZSKsN4h2sAzzF3CMkNiF81YQuQD <- is the crux of the issue
when I decided to disconnect, that miner had in excess of 65k (which should have brought the diff down hours ago)
tbh, looking at pool stats vs find luck, either your pool's luck is really sucking or your pool's reporting is off

[16-Sep-18 11:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"waves" can only be avoided by the information I have to go on

[16-Sep-18 11:41 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I will try to fix the luck issue. I see that many pool admins are reporting pool problems with z-nomp software

[16-Sep-18 11:43 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328

Z nomp does not work reliably with KMD assetchains

[17-Sep-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You should use knomp of which there are now  few versions, @webworker01  probably has the best version and knows the most about it.

Hey guys my buddy just got a 8 gpu 1070t nvidia mining rig - question is what’s the best way to mine kmd using this setup?

[17-Sep-18 07:52 PM] infotech-al#5583
I told him I would ask around

[17-Sep-18 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it has a real OS on it, I'd be partial to EWBF's miner

[17-Sep-18 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
otherwise, the choice might rely on the OS (if it has a "mining OS" on it)

Hey guys, I'm using the kmdminingpool and have been for a long time. Today I got way more kmd than a typical day. Is this a result of the difficulty talk mentioned above and will settle down and be okay now? It feels like the pool is on a chain fork happily mining away with low difficulty and I don't want my miners wasting time on a bad fork or something. 

Am I all set or do I need to switch pools?

[18-Sep-18 02:06 AM] Senter#6848
Looks like it stopped a few hours ago but it looks like kmdminingpool was mining every single block for almost half an hour. Really?

[18-Sep-18 02:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe the pool hit a block that had unclaimed rewards rewards

[18-Sep-18 02:07 AM] Senter#6848
Could be. Gotta love those days...

[18-Sep-18 04:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
mining many simultaneous blocks sounds like the pool could have been mining on a fork

[18-Sep-18 04:16 AM] Senter#6848
Hey there DukeLeto, hope all's well. That's what it looked like to me. I've gotten large single mine rewards in the past, which look more like a block with unclaimed rewards (they are sweet) but this was like 25 blocks in a row where normally I'll get 2 to 4 blocks a day from the pool. Anyway, thanks for chiming in on it.

[18-Sep-18 06:23 AM] $tefano.#3560
@Senter  @dukeleto it's not on a fork .. kmd daemon crashes on main server. ( i'm investigating on it )  many simultaneous blocks are paid when main server go up again. the important is that miners set ALWAYS backup server as a second server

[18-Sep-18 06:29 AM] $tefano.#3560
if main server go down, traffic it's redirect to backup pool ( if you have set backp.miningppol.clud as second server on miner software ) that continues to work. 
The interface and payments are stopped temporary.

[18-Sep-18 06:36 AM] $tefano.#3560
maybe after 130.000 kmd paid, wallet it's too big and kmd take time to elaborate payments.
I will try to create a new wallets to speed up kmd daemon resources

[18-Sep-18 06:36 AM] $tefano.#3560
sure this will be fix of this crash
Anyway it's works very well now

[18-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Resistor#1215
soooo.  there's pools that won't mine kmd.. why is this miningspeed dropped kmd?

[18-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Resistor#1215
by the looks of it one pool has literal 98% of the nethash

[18-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Resistor#1215
miners including asic miners can not even help distribute the hashing power.. why? is the question

[18-Sep-18 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Resistor miningspeed dropped KMD over personal issues with a user of another coin that had nothing to do with KMD 🤦

[18-Sep-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As for ASIC miners, if they really want to "distribute the hashing power" in a meaningful way, then they should be solo-mining anyway

[18-Sep-18 11:46 AM] Resistor#1215
solo mining how is this done

[18-Sep-18 11:46 AM] Resistor#1215
because right now 98% of the hashrate is on one pool.. soooo

[18-Sep-18 11:46 AM] Resistor#1215
why isn't there more pools to carry kmd?

[18-Sep-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can only assume that most pools don't have KMD for the same reason that KMD is market valued at ~$1 .... we live in an irrational world

[18-Sep-18 11:51 AM] Resistor#1215
I guess i'm not understanding. to eliminate double spend and 51% network attacks you're going to have to accomodate miners with a reasonable fee for one, then distribute hashing power accordingly.  is this project controlled by nicehash or something?  asic or no asic miners still want to get properly paid and distribute evenly. responsible ones anyway. nicehash is a joke

[18-Sep-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
miners only mine 25% of blocks
