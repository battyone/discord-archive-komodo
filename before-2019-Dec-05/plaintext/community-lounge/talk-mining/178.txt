from what you linked:
`The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency.` 
🤔 where have I heard that before?

[09-Sep-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's great in theory, but irl there's a loss that isn't generally worth in on scale

[09-Sep-19 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah for district heating on a scale that it heats an entire city I think losses pretty much kill it

[09-Sep-19 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but let's say if you can use it to heat a skyscraper or whtaever, that would be pretty straightforward

[09-Sep-19 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I'm a dreamer and I think in the not so distant future better insulation etc will make it possible nonetheless :p

[09-Sep-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I say make coal-fired miners instead

[09-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
then you would be shoveling coal for days :p

@Cryptoon ASIC miners are keeping my pipes from freezing as we speak

[09-Sep-19 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have their exhaust pointed at the pipes under my house that are most likely to freeze

[09-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as we speak? where are you living? Alaska? 😄

[09-Sep-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon somewhere that gets cold 😅

[09-Sep-19 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, they are un-insulated as they are being worked on, so the miners keep them warm until all the new insulation is added

[09-Sep-19 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is temporary until the asics are shipped to a land of cheap power. The plan is to warm the pipes with CPU miners in real winter

[09-Sep-19 03:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sweet

[09-Sep-19 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
my CPU miners make so much heat i must pipe it out all summer and they keep me warm all winter

Hi, will s-nomp work as pool for  KMD ?

[11-Sep-19 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it used to work for KMD itself with the right options selected, but there are many assetchains it will not work for

[11-Sep-19 12:11 PM] Support-RaptorPool.org#3091
Can you explain it closer ?

[11-Sep-19 12:11 PM] Support-RaptorPool.org#3091
I didn't get it 🙂

[11-Sep-19 12:12 PM] Support-RaptorPool.org#3091
It looks like equihash coin chain

[11-Sep-19 12:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@Support-RaptorPool.org genie says that s-nomp used to work for the KMD chain when the correct options were selected
but it doesn't work for many of the smart chains in our ecosystem that use the same komodod daemon

k-nomp works for most of the Smart Chains in the komodo ecosystem

[11-Sep-19 12:16 PM] Support-RaptorPool.org#3091
OK, I am trying to setup KMD 🙂

[11-Sep-19 12:17 PM] Support-RaptorPool.org#3091
so it should work ... we will see

[11-Sep-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it doesn't, then try

[14-Sep-19 02:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Interesting read. I havent finished it yet, but will comment that it takes a very narrow look on how only bitcoin could be used. If you were to look into how Komodo could be used in this situation, it would make more sense. Each planet/colony/ space station could run their own currency(chain) which solves the massive limitation of light lag factors that would be present only using bitcoin. The individual currencies would then be notarized to Komodo (light lag isnt as big of a problem because you dont have to wait for confirmations on your main chain).
Each currency would then have liquidity on the Komodo DEX, which would have light lag limitations, or people could trade direct with each other directly using their native currency using atomic swap tech (p2p atomic swap transactions).

[14-Sep-19 02:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's the perfect use case for the ecosystem Komodo is trying to build

[14-Sep-19 02:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Have atomicDEX satellites in orbit around each planet that runs their own currency, that manages communications between all of the connected planets/colonies/stations.

[14-Sep-19 02:55 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The people trying to trade would then only have to connect to the satellite closest to them.

[14-Sep-19 03:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`To people of the future, new tokens will seem like foolish scams as no token could have features not already provided by the bitcoin ecosystem and no token could amass sufficient hashrate to defend against even casual attacks by small bitcoin miners/pools. `

Say what now

[14-Sep-19 03:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
This situation may also be reason for keeping small black sizes.

[14-Sep-19 12:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka i agree with you. It's fascinating to read, but so dripping with BTC maximalism

[14-Sep-19 12:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
They don't go into how different PoW algos matter and they don't realize DPoW exists

[14-Sep-19 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`For people of the future, words like altcoin or staking will sound as silly as nephrology and laserdisc do to us today.`
Because DVDs exist without the advent of the laserdisk?
_has to agree about the maximalism and add "silliness"_

[14-Sep-19 08:12 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It reads more of a science fiction concept, rather than something that is actually likely to happen. Interesting to think about though

[15-Sep-19 11:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
"center of hash" is a real thing, and Martians will indeed be unable to mine BTC and will definitely launch their own coins, that much I agree with. But without knowing about DPoW, the author went down some rabbitholes that only a BTC maxi would. The future is more complex than they think

Essentially they are places where it's almost free to maintain a satellite, in terms of fuel costs

quantum entanglement

[15-Sep-19 11:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
I think we will see computing advances we can't dream of in the next 30 years, but will we invent tech that helps us communicate information faster than light over macroscopic scales? Highly doubtful, and I would love to be proven wrong! If so, that means I will be going to Alpha Centauri for a weekend vacation

[15-Sep-19 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I see none of the above happening in 30 years, or even in the lifetime of anyone reading this

[15-Sep-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we've reached that point in science (as a whole, but not all specifics) where the larger tenancy is to treat "accepted" things as absolute truths and it's going to take the next 2 or 3 successive "out of the box" thinkers to advance us further at any significant level, imo

[15-Sep-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto hasnt quantum entanglement been verified, and it transmits information faster than light, using existing scientific knowledge

[15-Sep-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
just fly half the entangled stuff out to mars and create a exabit bandwidth with low latency

[15-Sep-19 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```We found  that  (some)  entanglement  can be  certified with  at  least  99.74%  confidence  by  detecting around   20   copies   of   the   quantum   state.   Additionally,   we   found   that   genuine   six-qubit entanglement is verified with at least  99% confidence by using around 112 copies of the state. ```
It may just be my skepticism, but that reads to me like confirmation bias that ignores the fact that the more tests they run the lower the confidence becomes 🤷🏽

[15-Sep-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
observation affects quantum states, maybe that is why

[15-Sep-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
any signal with 80%+ accuracy is good enough, add enough error correcting codes till it is accurate enough

[15-Sep-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true
Not saying that it's not valid or usable (especially since the actual paper is behind a paywall and I cannot read the full thing), just that it reads "off" to me

[15-Sep-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Found a copy...
It is just a wonky wording in the abstract/conclusion

[15-Sep-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99.74% confidence that entanglement exists in 20 copies
99+% confidence of biseparability in 112 copies
