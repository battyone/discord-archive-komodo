"I used to be #3 on Suprnova"
And I ran a netsplit on more MSNChat rooms than anyone in the network's history
Who give a fek about either of those things?

[28-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I guess with ideas like, "the z9 and a 1080ti are the same price", and "25%" I can see why such a decision was made so hastily.

[28-Jun-18 01:04 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Its not about you CG, I was just explaining to @xRobeSx that I'm not marginalized miner.

[28-Jun-18 01:04 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Now, please stop responding unless you have something legitimate to say if you're going to address me.

[28-Jun-18 01:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
The main factor was that NN's mine 75% of the blocks and there's no threat of a 51%. So why not let the hash rise and the network be more secure

[28-Jun-18 01:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I really have nothing else to say, switch your rigs elsewhere if you want

[28-Jun-18 01:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
But I bet most z9's won't be on KMD network anyway, since only 25% of the blocks are up for grabs ...

[28-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Beetcoin#9049
They are, and have been

[28-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Pretty heavily actually.

[28-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Beetcoin#9049
But I probably monitor nethash more than most haha

[28-Jun-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes, more than me. But whats wrong with the hash rising? besides you making less $?

[28-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Difficulty rising is the concern because eventually asics will run into zero profitability, and then simply switch coins

[28-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You'd have to rely on the nodes, and on any crazy gpu miners still left, to continue mining until the difficulty corrects

[28-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Which could technically cause some bumps along the way

[28-Jun-18 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"But I probably monitor nethash more than most"
How do you manage to monitor a non-factual estimate?

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
And why?

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Beetcoin#9049
ü§¶

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Even if all the asic's leave, there is no concern. CPU miners can come back for all i care...

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That's the issue, though @xRobeSx

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You're basically making a stance that says, "we don't care enough to support your needs"

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
NN's mine 75% of the blocks.. even if ASIC's, and CPU's leave, NN's could mine the other 25% as well in open competition

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And then asking for them to return

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Beetcoin#9049
But not protecting them if they did

[28-Jun-18 01:09 PM] Beetcoin#9049
By that point, you'd become centralized, no?

[28-Jun-18 01:09 PM] Beetcoin#9049
If NN's did 100%

[28-Jun-18 01:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm a NN, and I know 100% the NN's will protect the network no matter if the hash rises to the moon, or goes away

[28-Jun-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
'You're basically making a stance that says, "we don't care enough to support your needs"'
No, the basic stance is that your personal economics shouldn't be a pandering factor of the protocol.

[28-Jun-18 01:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
if NN's did 100% its because no one else wants to mine the 25%

[28-Jun-18 01:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
all they'd need to beat the NN's is genproc=3 cpu

[28-Jun-18 01:10 PM] Beetcoin#9049
True or false, Genie. By allowing ASICS to run on the network, GPU miners will become unprofitable over time.

[28-Jun-18 01:11 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I know its not for me... but TRUE. and that's fine. If you're mining you should realize that the technology is better, and you should use some of your GPU profits to upgrade your hardware to the latest, most efficient tech. IMO

[28-Jun-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Difficulty rising is the concern because eventually asics will run into zero profitability, and then simply switch coins

You are showing a full lack of understanding Komodo protocol with this claim.
*If* that were to happen, the NNs blocks would re levelize the diff

[28-Jun-18 01:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
exactly

[28-Jun-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"True or false, Genie. By allowing ASICS to run on the network, GPU miners will become unprofitable over time."
Why does the protocol care about your personal profitability?

[28-Jun-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Are there profitable GPUs for Bitcoin?

[28-Jun-18 01:12 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Ignore the protocol, its not smart from a business standpoint to alienate and marginalize supporters

[28-Jun-18 01:12 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I'm not sure how you haven't figured that bit out

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Ignore the protocol"
dafuq?

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] Beetcoin#9049
If your forked today, and left GPU'S  on the network, would there be a downside to KMD?

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Would KMD be any less secure?

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
more hashrate is better

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
james has admitted its better as in safer

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Safer, how?

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Specifically.

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Other than taking 30 seconds to say "nahhh"

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Has anyone broke down, in the big picture, this decision?

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a higher diff block is ALWAYS more secure than a lower diff block; because, Bitcoin

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] Beetcoin#9049
So far, I'm getting a resounding no.

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
this has been discussed before

[28-Jun-18 01:15 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That's what I'm looking for

[28-Jun-18 01:15 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That discussion

[28-Jun-18 01:15 PM] xRobeSx#5136
That's why we've moved to discord.. because slack doesn't preserve text

[28-Jun-18 01:15 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I'd like to read what the dev team wrote

[28-Jun-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Beetcoin If you want a discussion, perhaps come to the table without the preconceived notion of "Me Ogg. Ogg say GPU good, ASIC bad"

[28-Jun-18 01:17 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm sure eventually @jl777c is going to pop in here and give you quick message explaining everything correct, give him time to get on.    On that note, I'm gonna go try to get something done. I appreciate your concerns and supporting KMD @Beetcoin but there really is no harm in ASIC's on KMD. üòÉ

[28-Jun-18 01:17 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Says the guy claiming to be a 4th generation mechanic who thinks there are cars that don't require 91 octane

_goes back to working on his asset stratum_

[28-Jun-18 01:18 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I actually disagree with that @xRobeSx I think there's significant harm in ASICS on KMD, especially if the NN's are as entrenched as you guys claim them to be.

[28-Jun-18 01:18 PM] Beetcoin#9049
There's significant community blowback to be had

[28-Jun-18 01:18 PM] Beetcoin#9049
But if that conversation isn't saved, I suppose my search is over

[28-Jun-18 01:18 PM] PTYX#6840
entrenched?

[28-Jun-18 01:19 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Firmly established?

[28-Jun-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"There's significant community blowback to be had"
The community says üñïüèø and your narrow-minded refusal to evolve

[28-Jun-18 01:19 PM] xRobeSx#5136
elected annually

[28-Jun-18 01:19 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Ingrained? Solid?

[28-Jun-18 01:20 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Each NN pubkey is directly in KMD codebase and is changed each year for the elected notaries

[28-Jun-18 01:20 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I think you misunderstand me

[28-Jun-18 01:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
so yes that is firmly established. But they are elected. That's kind of irrelevant though, it's more about the fact that they mine 75% and make 51% attacks not possible, so the increase of hashrate with ASIC's isn't doing harm to the network

[28-Jun-18 01:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I get that you think that means certain GPU supporters will stop supporting KMD

[28-Jun-18 01:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but I can tell you that there are certain people I know that never GPU mined, and are excited and now mining with ASIC's

[28-Jun-18 01:22 PM] Beetcoin#9049
The 75% is what I was talking about with the entrenched comment

[28-Jun-18 01:22 PM] xRobeSx#5136
so that's arguing the opposite, that possibly more community support can be gained by allowing ASICS to mine on our network

[28-Jun-18 01:22 PM] Beetcoin#9049
There are far more GPU miners than asic miners, actually.

[28-Jun-18 01:22 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That possibility of "more" support could never be true.

[28-Jun-18 01:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I agree, I'm just saying I know of people who order/and some that have received their z9's minis and are mining, that never GPU mined before. So it's not like we're just losing miners, new ones will come as well

[28-Jun-18 01:23 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Certainly every z9 owner who bought the miner thinking they could mine anything else, will indeed find solace here, though.

[28-Jun-18 01:24 PM] xRobeSx#5136
exactly, look at all those miners we could fine just because every other coin wants to fork

[28-Jun-18 01:24 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Getting 200 new miners at the cost of 1000 isn't plus.

[28-Jun-18 01:24 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but those GPU miners that left at least heard about KMD and most likely own some still.

[28-Jun-18 01:24 PM] xRobeSx#5136
they'll just mine something more profitable

[28-Jun-18 01:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
doesn't mean they don't believe or hodl kmd anymore

[28-Jun-18 01:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
mine something more profitable, sell it, and buy KMD

[28-Jun-18 01:25 PM] Beetcoin#9049
"Today at 3:11 AM
Yeah kmd, zcash and any coins that aren‚Äôt forking are dead to me.
Sold all my kmd and zcash."

[28-Jun-18 01:26 PM] Beetcoin#9049
From one of those messages I received after my post here.

[28-Jun-18 01:26 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Probably not best to assume what a marginalized miner might or might not be doing, now that they can't physically suppport the coin profitably.

[28-Jun-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Getting 200 new miners at the cost of 1000 isn't plus."
Actually, per hash per unit, it'd be a 1.5X bump; but who cares about facts when you're stuck in a rhetoric spewing rut

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
honestly I'd rather have a true supporter than someone mining KMD just to dump

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but thanks anyway

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Beetcoin#9049
CG, it isn't about the hashrate bump, its about the community, you imbecile.

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i realize people have to mine to support costs

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You have to sell some to maintain the ability to hold, as a miner

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but if your whole point is to mine KMD just to dump it all and not hodl any, go mine something else

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i get that

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Therefore profitability must be there.

[28-Jun-18 01:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but then they're hodling some in your situation

[28-Jun-18 01:28 PM] Beetcoin#9049
You removed profitability, you remove mining support.

[28-Jun-18 01:28 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And no, I don't support mining to dump

[28-Jun-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"it isn't about the hashrate bump, its about the community"
evidently not, because the community cares about the tech advancements, not protecting the personal investments of "miners" that refuse to evolve
