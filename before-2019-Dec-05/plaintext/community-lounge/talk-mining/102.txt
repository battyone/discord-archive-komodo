maybe 750w

[26-Feb-19 04:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i want a PSU that will deal with heat well

[26-Feb-19 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have no clue how to run just one, I use server PSUs with breakout boards

[26-Feb-19 04:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will just use a spare 850 I have and call it good i guess 😃

[26-Feb-19 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
50% of max wattage maximizes efficiency and all that

[26-Feb-19 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
but i don't know much about server PSUs

[26-Feb-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I use similar to this:

[26-Feb-19 05:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
interesting

[26-Feb-19 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
using one PSU for 1 or 2 rigs has overhead compared to that, but when something fails, it's a smaller cluster of rigs that fail

[26-Feb-19 05:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am building a "lights out DC" that won't have humans except rarely, so I am optimizing for up-time and low maintenance, because down-time will be long and expensive to fix, if humans are needed

[26-Feb-19 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
at big scale, i can see the reason to use those breakouts, maybe i will get there soon 😃

[26-Feb-19 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 did you get any A9+'s yet?

[26-Feb-19 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is some beef

[26-Feb-19 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
thinking hard of how many a9/a9+'s would be "too many"

[26-Feb-19 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not yet, I need a $1.25 KMD before I can buy new toys

[26-Feb-19 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh gosh yes, that would be nice

[26-Feb-19 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`thinking hard of how many a9/a9+'s would be "too many"`
1 more than all of them

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
for my scale, i am really thinking of whether i should have a9's or the new a9+'s

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
13amp unit VS 5am unit

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
13amps is some shizzle

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is stock, maybe 15amps with OC

[26-Feb-19 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
a9's allow me to fill my 100amps, which are spread across breakers, more efficiently. I could in theory extend to 200amps but i would need add support for that. Trying to efficiently use 100amps before spending on infra to expand to 200amps

[26-Feb-19 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you are running on 220v, yes?

[26-Feb-19 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
nope

[26-Feb-19 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you fill 100 amps @ 110, you're killing your ROI

[26-Feb-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
how expensive to install a 220v ?

[26-Feb-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depends on how close your miners are to your box
if they are close, you just need different breakers, heavier wire, and 15 or 20 amp outlets

[26-Feb-19 05:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I had to buy a new dryer a few years ago... it runs on 110 so I was able to repurpose that plug. 😜👍

[26-Feb-19 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the initial outlay is "pricey", but switching will save a ton in the long run

[26-Feb-19 05:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A9+ 

*Ugh.  Do I really need more miners?*

[26-Feb-19 05:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
🤔

[26-Feb-19 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
___always__ needs more miners_

[26-Feb-19 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the bear and 1 bad day took me from being #2 to like #10 😭

[26-Feb-19 05:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I can’t put more miners at home without stupid prohibitive rates.

[26-Feb-19 05:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They already are.   Time for some hosting action I guess.   Not that comfortable with that though.

[26-Feb-19 05:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can add another 200 amps to the personal setup before they make me get a new transformer
as for rates, living in the middle of nowhere and being on a coop helps 🙂

[26-Feb-19 05:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I guess picking the right algo is important too.

current markets, 11 months isn't "awful" imo 🤷🏽

[26-Feb-19 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 at 5c/kwh, how big would the difference of 220 vs 110 be? I can see adding 220v, and  transitioning all miners to it over the next 2yrs, but not redo-ing my current 110v stuff

[26-Feb-19 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that partially depends on the PSU, but with "average" that I've used there's a 20-25% increase in max watts per PSU and iirc 8-15% in effeciency

[26-Feb-19 06:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Must have been an old link I ended up at.

[26-Feb-19 06:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto  a couple of things if you are residential that 5c/kWh  is probably supply side only , make sure you add up all the costs (distribution, transmission,  fees etc.)  it’s not too hard to run a 240v circuit run. Need 10 AWG 3 wire .  30A double pole breaker and outlet and PDU with appropriate plug.   The main benefits of running at higher voltage is that you can get more miners in per circuit ( I=V/R). and efficiency increase,  Current generates heat ( W=I ^2*R)  , conductors like copper increase their resistance based on heat resulting in less efficiency.

[26-Feb-19 06:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Tldr: costs are a little bit higher with electric company with 110v, generates more heat and run less miners per circuit

[26-Feb-19 09:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog very good details, thanks. There is a $30/month "service fee" and 5.11 cents/kwh, so yes, my monthly cost approaches 5.11 cents/kwh with more power use, averaging the total cost. It's cheap hydro power from a dam a few miles away 😃

[26-Feb-19 09:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will definitely add a 240v circuit in the near term, now that I see all the benefits

[26-Feb-19 09:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
mostly, for the room to expand, on a fixed amperage, but the efficiency and less heat is really nice too. just makes sense

[26-Feb-19 09:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
which leads to my next question, what kind of PDUs should I be looking at?

[26-Feb-19 09:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I use tripplite, https://m.newegg.com/products/N82E16812120346?ignorebbr=true&source=googleshopping&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile-_-pla-_-Power+Distribution+Units-_-N82E16812120346&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInKzqtK3a4AIVj6GzCh2fVQYqEAQYAyABEgIdNPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

[26-Feb-19 09:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
can shop around for price  , haven’t had any issues so far with them

[26-Feb-19 09:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog is the breaker the same, just needs to be double pole 30amp, correct? Or are there 110 breakers and 240 breakers?

[26-Feb-19 09:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
i installed the breakers and gfci outlets of the 110v, so i know the basics

[26-Feb-19 09:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, i hate how there are proprietary breaker types, ugh. Just wanted to complain about it.

[26-Feb-19 09:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just double pole 30amp is right,  don’t think there is a double pole for 110v because that would be ungrounding the circuit ( cutting it off entirely but could pose a safety hazard if somehow device is energized despite switch being off ) ,  your panel manufacturer should have its recommended breaker.

[26-Feb-19 09:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Neutral goes to bar so not sure how it would work on 110v double pole tbh lol

[26-Feb-19 09:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Double poles are 240v so no worries

[26-Feb-19 09:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, like i said, i only know the basics of electrical 😃

[26-Feb-19 09:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can talk about the maxwell equations all day, but I am still learning about everyday electrical stuff

[26-Feb-19 09:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like i need new breakers, thick cable, PDU and compatible PSUs (some do both)

[26-Feb-19 09:56 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
Hi, I really like this project; bitcoin level security, blockchain and Dapp development .. just too much to list.  I have a GPU garden, ( little smaller than a farm ), but found it unproductive to GPU mine KMD.  Can anyone tell me what I prospectively could expect if I pickup a used Z9 mini to start off with?  Please advise .. thank you.  Respectfully, George

[26-Feb-19 09:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Psu is probably compatible already most are 120-240v .

[26-Feb-19 09:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@WoundedxWarr1or welcome. You found the right place. Get comfy and learn from all the smart people in here

[26-Feb-19 09:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i thought so, but my brain always assumes worst case 😃

[26-Feb-19 09:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
i try to buy quality PSUs, EVGA and Corsair for deskstop stuff. I still have more CPU miners than ASICs, but that will change soon

[26-Feb-19 09:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, PSUs rated to 50F, because i have issues with overheating. My biggest concern is overheating in summer

[26-Feb-19 09:58 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
Thank you Duke; I have been lurking for a while .. it just took me to long to mine a handful of KMD with 32 GPU's

[26-Feb-19 09:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@WoundedxWarr1or  kmd is strange with mining because notaries mine the majority, better to mine something like pirate and convert in.

[26-Feb-19 09:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@WoundedxWarr1or 1 or 2 z9m are fine to dip your toe, but otherwise, they are inefficient, and you want a9 or a9+

👍 👆🏽 

[26-Feb-19 10:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, this is not financial advice :abusedsmily:

[26-Feb-19 10:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@WoundedxWarr1or you can mine any KMD asset chain with same HW/software

{Reactions}
👍 

[26-Feb-19 10:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
which gives you dozens of options

[26-Feb-19 10:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
what @polycryptoblog is saying, is you want to speculatively mine a KMD AC, and then sell it for KMD, versus mining KMD directly

[26-Feb-19 10:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's like mining other coins and trading for BTC, instead of mining BTC directly

[26-Feb-19 10:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can also do all of the above

[26-Feb-19 10:02 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
Okay, make perfect sense .. thx.

[26-Feb-19 10:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, ARRR is a good option

some are external coins, but most are KMD ACs, that is probably the best list of them all

[26-Feb-19 10:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH is currently an external coin, but it's becoming an AC. Either way, you can mine it with same HW

[26-Feb-19 10:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can also mine ZEC/ZEN/VOT/SAFE(!) and maybe a few other coins with the same equihash (200,9) variant

[26-Feb-19 10:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD is indeed one of the most attractive, tho. that is why we are all here 😃

[26-Feb-19 10:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
GPU mining on KMD is in the past, i don't recommend it. ASICs are here, and they prevent secret FPGA mining

[26-Feb-19 10:06 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
Does ARRR obfuscate with mixins and rings like LOKI or XMR, or more like ZEC?

[26-Feb-19 10:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_schedules to turn his GPUs back to KMD on Monday just because @dukeleto said not to_
