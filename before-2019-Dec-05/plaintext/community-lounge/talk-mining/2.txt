the latter half of my statement is a major change for orphan interest

[19-Jun-18 03:23 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Definitely I feel like this will be a defining moment for privacy cryptos specifically zksnarks vs. ring signatures

[19-Jun-18 03:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They have clearly taken divergent dev paths now. Funny thing is we know where the asic path leads. *stares at BTC/BCH*

[19-Jun-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If your stratum and your interweb connections are good, orphans are quite minimal
I think I've had like 3 this year and that includes days of 1M+ Sols in rentals

[19-Jun-18 03:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
granted a community split will be less likely I think in privacy cryptos due to the dev team coming from inception with ico's

[19-Jun-18 03:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
orphans are rare

[19-Jun-18 03:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
😮

[19-Jun-18 03:27 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I know  you ordered a ton of z9's You going to do 50/50

[19-Jun-18 03:27 PM] BlackJesus#6161
with your amount you certainly have to be pointing a decent size at zcash

[19-Jun-18 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as it stands now, the plan is that 1 mini will be on a custom stratum for asset chains (I still haven't started writing it yet, though), the GPU power will go towards Stanford's folding program, and most (if not all) of the minis will be on KMD

[19-Jun-18 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
short of some outstanding profit margin jump, I can't see me aiming anything at zcash

[19-Jun-18 03:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
gotcha, same I see komodo on par and most likely better then ethereum. And we all know where ethereum peaked at :/.

[19-Jun-18 03:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Losses today are major gains tommorow.

[19-Jun-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, if you look at value expected (assuming a rehitting of ath), ZEC = 4:1 and KMD = 6:1

[19-Jun-18 03:36 PM] BlackJesus#6161
true.

[19-Jun-18 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and if you expand to 10x, KMD will hit $19.50 long before ZEC hits $1,982.5

[19-Jun-18 03:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's very true.

[19-Jun-18 03:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I  fully expect komodo to go through a fomo phase unlike any other coin.

[19-Jun-18 03:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Due to the self generating interest.

[19-Jun-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's literally the reason that I'm dumping so much under $2.25 in order to buy minis and Z9s too (when they come out)
I'm betting on a far greater future return than holding

[19-Jun-18 03:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
oh wow.

[19-Jun-18 03:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm planning to buy z9's as well.

[19-Jun-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Assuming most mini buyers head to ZEC, I should make it all back before Jan 1

[19-Jun-18 03:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the majority will definitely be on ZEC

[19-Jun-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The evil side of me has a true hope that one of the ASIC makers (hopefully BM since I'm buying so many from them) make their fw open source and they can support RAM upgrades and the KN changers get crushed

[19-Jun-18 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
even if 3GB of RAM sends the BM prices up by 10x, they're still more powerful and profitable than GPUs

[19-Jun-18 03:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
what is a kn changer

[19-Jun-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a few coins are changing the K and N values of their algo to be "more ASIC resistant", based on the myth that ASIC have like no RAM

[19-Jun-18 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
There are supposive  firmware dumps of z9s floating around

[19-Jun-18 03:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
oh yea, I heard about that to break asics they were upgrading the k and n values

[19-Jun-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it doesn't "break" anything; in simplest terms, it just makes a more "complex" computation that requires more RAM and power to solve
with 200 and 9 as values, a 1080TI uses 50 MB of RAM and can do ~740 Sol/s
with 144 and 5 as values, a 1080TI uses 2.5 GB of RAM and can do ~58 Sol/s

[19-Jun-18 03:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
that's dumb why would zcash do tht

[19-Jun-18 03:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Right now they are doing their best to reduce the memory intensiveness of shielded transactions

[19-Jun-18 03:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
making the base algorithm more memory intensive seems extremely counterintuitive

[19-Jun-18 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it reality, the change is driven by 2 camps
those that own GPUs already
those that hate Bitmain

[20-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Quite speedy delivery actually

[20-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Surprised they ship it by air

[20-Jun-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
UPS air is a bit faster and more expensive than FedEx boat

[20-Jun-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
conversely FedEx pre-clears shipments, so less overall issues with customs
It's a coin flip, really; but, since BM has the account page feked for what they link to FedEx when you order I went with UPS this time around

[20-Jun-18 04:09 PM] SHossain#0007
I will never use FedEx anymore in life if I have other alternatives. Would even pay more for other companies.

[20-Jun-18 05:41 PM] xRobeSx#5136
whats your beef with fedex shossain?

[20-Jun-18 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
besides the hidden fees?

[20-Jun-18 05:52 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not disagreeing, just wondering. I've never really noticed fedex fee's being much more than anyone else's.. but most of my shipping comes from amazon

[20-Jun-18 05:53 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I just saw my email from Bitmain. It says that my power supply was shipped but not the z9 mini... hmm

[20-Jun-18 05:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
every international shipment I've ever gotten through FedEx, they "pre clear" customs and then try to charge me for it after

[20-Jun-18 10:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I feel like I need to hang out in here more often.   
None of my minis have shipped.   I am sad fishy. 
I did half my order with UPS and half with DHL.   I hope DHL gets it right.   I've always used them in the past but not so much for international.

[20-Jun-18 10:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
DHL will likely get shipped FedEX part way

[20-Jun-18 10:51 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
Ups z9’s on route woop

[20-Jun-18 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@crackhead, how many did you order?

[20-Jun-18 11:26 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
Limit was 1 :/

[20-Jun-18 11:27 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
For the first batch

[20-Jun-18 11:28 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
All the coins will have run away from the algo by the time everyone get them

[20-Jun-18 11:28 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
Only to do it all again when they produce the new algos too

[21-Jun-18 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... maybe they will all just get pointed at KMD if all other coins change. Should give our hash rate a nice boost 😛

[21-Jun-18 09:06 AM] jansako#3330
Hi folks, anyone here knows about a Dutch company 'Whinkel' (www.whinkel.be)? Looks like I got hoodwhinkel'd by them... ordered ~10K EUR worth in miners, they stopped communicating not long after the Bitmain news... Of course I ordered a bunch of 1080's a week before the  Bitmain news, but that is a different story...

[21-Jun-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136

@jansako if you want I know some lawyers in Belgium

[21-Jun-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is confused as to why you'd even buy one 2nd-hand retail 😦_

[21-Jun-18 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Your package is awaiting release from the clearing agency for formal entry at the export location."
Yay, customs lag in China; because, who wants miners anyway 😔

[21-Jun-18 02:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How much hash coming your way in the first batch?

[21-Jun-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1 from batch 1 and 2 from batch 1.5

[21-Jun-18 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ah so not that much initially

[21-Jun-18 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thought I read that you had something like 50+ units coming your way

[21-Jun-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
In the july/aug batch I have 45

[21-Jun-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
45 confirmed; I'd like to push it to 60

[21-Jun-18 02:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If I had that much hash coming my way

[21-Jun-18 02:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would probably be too tempted to point them at shitcoin x or y and mess around a bit

[21-Jun-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I might do that after they pay themselves off

[21-Jun-18 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So after a month or so? ;p

[21-Jun-18 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm curious to see how many 51% incidents we will see the coming months

[21-Jun-18 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
at current markets, like 4 months 😦

[21-Jun-18 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And how miners will adjust to new equilibria

[21-Jun-18 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As some will change algo etc

[21-Jun-18 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm still of the belief that manufactures will not be too far behind in adding RAM and 3 variables

[21-Jun-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
unless ZEC moons, they almost have to in order to sell any more units past Jan 1

[21-Jun-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
meanwhile, GPU fanboys are betting on the misguided notion that real miners will not be willing to pay up to 10x extra for ASICs that earn 14x ROI over GPUs 🙄

[21-Jun-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wasnt a Z9 mini already 10x more performant for only like twice the price?

[21-Jun-18 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
current batches (with PSU included) are ~ $30 more than 1 single 1080TI card
by the time you count hw, minis are cheaper than 1 card and ~13.5x the sols

[21-Jun-18 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
per sols, you need 14 1080TIs to match 1 mini
and 10k sol GPUs are at 13x the energy costs too

[21-Jun-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a mini at $8,500 is still a discount over GPUs

[21-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
damn

[21-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Was pretty close to buying a 10k 1080ti rig back in march

[21-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Good thing I was too lazy to do more research first

[21-Jun-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a single 10k rig is too much overclock for my taste

[21-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
10k usd

[21-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not sols

[21-Jun-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ahh

[21-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That would have been money down the drain (in hindsight)

[21-Jun-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not really, you could always use it to fold or stick it on a donkey coin

[21-Jun-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'll likely put most of my GPUs back to folding before the end of the year

[21-Jun-18 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
put it back to folding?
