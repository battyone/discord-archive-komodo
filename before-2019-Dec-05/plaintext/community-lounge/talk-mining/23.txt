z-nomp is dead simple

[23-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
not the case at all

[23-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
that's just propaganda from pool operators üòÇ

[23-Jul-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if it requires anything other than dumping redis and debug.log once every 4 months, then you're doing it wrong

[23-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
running a *public* pool can be annoying, but running your own private solo mining pool is dead simple

installing npm from ubuntu repos will give you problems

@Alright installing npm from packages is usually asking for trouble

[23-Jul-18 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
so it comes down to "how much time you spend installing/maintaining znomp" versus 0.5% fee, if we are talking purely financial

[23-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Alright#0419
installing takes 15-20 minutes

[23-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Alright#0419
"maintaining" it is keeping a process running

[23-Jul-18 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
if we estimate $10/day profit per z9, that is 5 cents a day pool fee, or about $1.50/month. If you value your time at all, it doesn't work out

[23-Jul-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@dukeleto short of typing
`nvm use 8
npm start`
after any reboot, I'm still lost as to this "maintaining znomp" you keep speaking of

[23-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Alright#0419
it's the same amount of effort to keep your miner program running

[23-Jul-18 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am taking into account all the time that inevitably comes with "making sure it still works", looking at log files, dealing with stuff that "shouldn't happen"

[23-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
yea that hasn't happened to me in the 6 months I've been solo mining

[23-Jul-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
i usually err on the side of "do everything myself" but I am trying to look at this purely financially

[23-Jul-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright that is a good data point. Y'all give me hope that znomp isn't a total pain

[23-Jul-18 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_hasn't touched his NOMP or znomp is 6 months and short of "fine tuning" profit switcher hasn't done any "maintaining znomp" in over a year_

[23-Jul-18 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie awesome, that is good to hear

[23-Jul-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if any pool operators out there are going to add Verus, it seems they need to do a lot of work to znomp, right? To replace equihash with verushash. I haven't seen any pool actually say they are working on it

[23-Jul-18 03:40 PM] Alright#0419
no compatible miner yet either

[23-Jul-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yeah, since it's a different creature, it's not going to be as simple as "plug and play" dropping VRSC into znomp

[23-Jul-18 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
i haven't heard from Verus core anything about their own pool, either

[23-Jul-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've got a miner close to accepting args well enough to use a remote wallet, from there it should be too massive to make it run on a stratum if I can figure out enough of the "guts" to make a stratum that works

[23-Jul-18 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have vague plans to revive my hushwebminer codebase and make it mine Verus instead, since it makes a whole lot more sense to CPU mine Verus in a browser. So I need a backend znomp/etc to talk to, and it sure would be great if I didn't have to write it myself üòÉ

[23-Jul-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the real hassle, I think (I haven't gotten that far to know for sure), is going to be a verifier to preempt "fake shares"

[23-Jul-18 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
if anybody gets znomp+Verus working or knows somebody that has, please get in touch. I would prefer to concentrate on the "frontend" of webmining and collab with somebody that is developing the backend. Dealing with webassembly and websockets is enough fun to keep me busy

[23-Jul-18 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_writes such a thing, keeps it closed-source, and collects a 2% fee from all the lazy people_

[23-Jul-18 03:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
do it

[23-Jul-18 03:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
i dare you. I prefer to be lazy and enjoy life

[23-Jul-18 03:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
fuck staring at debug.log files, I have done it enough already

[23-Jul-18 03:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just gonna charge a fee to the webminer, i can absorb your cost üòÉ

[23-Jul-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

*attemps to set up a pool*

[24-Jul-18 03:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
has anyone gotten a z9mini to connect to any public pool and/or nicehash?

[24-Jul-18 03:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which z-nomp should I be using? I can make the configs just fine, we made scipts to do that automatically for AC's on the sacling test.

[24-Jul-18 03:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
anything I try to connect mine to, other than my own local stratum, shows as "Dead"

[24-Jul-18 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r z-nomp from zclassic was the one I first used

[24-Jul-18 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@xRobeSx has a z-nomp git too, I think

[24-Jul-18 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
k cool...guess as long as the configs are right it should not matter... I'm not interested in the payout feature or anything, I just want to force empty blocks.

[24-Jul-18 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll try robes one I guess.

üò¶ anyone use TLS (SSL) on znomp?  I have to use claymore and they "steal" 2% of my hash rate unless I use SSL.

[24-Jul-18 04:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r after you get the hang of how it works, this is a good one to use if you have no need for "bells and whistles"
https://github.com/aayanl/equihash-solomining
It does has some issues with stuffing up the JSON for blocks if you are on an asset chain and hit too many too fast, but other than that, it's pretty solid

I never bother with tls/ssl on solo and why do you "have" to use claymore?

[24-Jul-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because my miner is terrible

[24-Jul-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The litteral only way to make it work, was with a custom archlinux wth hacked drivers and claymore software

[24-Jul-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
took weeks to work out...biggest waste of time.

[24-Jul-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If what I am trying out here works, I can at least use it for something, otherswise I'll make a bunch of cheap gaming computers and sell them all.

[24-Jul-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess not using SSL is no big deal, I am not mining for profit here.

exactly why profits come from new, if you don't have "top end" you're fighting uphill instead of earning

d you need the magic value for that simple pool you linked... we seem to have removed it from the scaletest znomp configs.

whats the resource use between znomp and the other one?

I have plenty of ram and cores, but my VM's might need a shuffle to have ti work properly.

[24-Jul-18 04:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the other one?

[24-Jul-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
solo mining one you linked?

[24-Jul-18 04:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it doesn't use redis and just stores basic found block info in a JSON file

[24-Jul-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok sounds like the one I want to use then

[24-Jul-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
BUT

[24-Jul-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's a 1 coin only setup

[24-Jul-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks... might be able to convert that scaletest script to generate all coinfigs for all chains.

[24-Jul-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to point 1 card at each chain.

[24-Jul-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if my miner will let me do that... got a feeling the celeron might explode doing that lol

[24-Jul-18 04:22 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
you can do that, you just need to stick it in multiple dirs and use different port #s

[24-Jul-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm... might just do it for RFOX and my 50/50 PoS/PoW chain see how it goes iwth ram use and stuff.

[24-Jul-18 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I use a heavily modded z-nomp for my profit mining and a modded version of that solo one for SN, DEX and COQUI

[24-Jul-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can that profit switching be changed to a "time based switch" ?

[24-Jul-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it just rotates thorugh chains ?

[24-Jul-18 04:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it can, if you mod the switcher (the one I started like that uses a JSON file with the assets listed in it)
