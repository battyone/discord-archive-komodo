I support mining of quality coins, profitably.

[28-Jun-18 01:29 PM] xRobeSx#5136
it doesn't need to be profitable forever......  it was, they sold some to pay bills, and got to hodl the rest... now its unprofitable so you switch, but you don't have to say "fuck kmd and dump"... if you believe you'll keep hodling, switch to something more profitable, and as i said above, sell the mined profitable coin to buy more KMD

[28-Jun-18 01:29 PM] xRobeSx#5136
that is if you really believe

[28-Jun-18 01:29 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Refuse to evolve is a moot point when you decide to launch on equihash, CG. The coin literally designed from the onset to avoid asics.

[28-Jun-18 01:29 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I'm holding, don't worry

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Its the fact that you've marginalized mining support

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Forcing them out the door

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Forcing some to say "fuck KMD, never again"

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Tangibly more support than any amount of asics would ever have brought.

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
that's their own stupid fault TBH

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
as you said, you are a believer so you're hodling some

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"The coin literally designed from the onset to avoid asics."
And the US embraced slavery from the onset; rational minds evolve into accepting what is right over "what was"

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Beetcoin#9049
They are stupid for supporting KMD?

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That makes no sense.

[28-Jun-18 01:31 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Now your'e really blocked CG

"Its the fact that you've marginalized mining support"
No one is "marginalizing miner support", except those that think "miners should only be x and only have y equipment"

[28-Jun-18 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If the definition of "miner" is limited to that which Joe Burgerflipper can afford to mine while making minimum wage, then miners are marginalizing themselves

[28-Jun-18 01:36 PM] xRobeSx#5136
stupid IMO yes because KMD has way more going for it than just mining. Yes that's one way to get involved, but if it's not profitable, its not profitable... face it. No need to rage out and dump it. Being non profitable doesn't make it a bad coin or have bad features. Smart miners mine profitable coins, sell them, and buy the coins they really want. 

I truly do agree with you that we don't wanna just upset people and lose awhole bunch of people. But i really see you making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. You even agree'd you are still hodling. So you're one of the smart one's, even if you do have to switch your rigs to something more profitable. 

I really don't think there is anything wrong with ASIC mining, its more efficient and it doesn't hurt our network.  The GPU miners can mine profitably elsewhere and continue supporting KMD by BUYING and not dumping for costs. or good luck.

[28-Jun-18 01:42 PM] Beetcoin#9049
"I truly do agree with you that we don't wanna just upset people and lose awhole bunch of people. ", that's actually my point. As a HODLer, I want to support the coin because I believe in the tech. But if you unnecessarily alienate and marginalize supporters, you start working against your own best interests. And if a decision like that is made in 30 seconds with no real dispute like the one I've brought here, that's very alarming. Then you end up with people in my inbox, seeing me sispute some points for apparently the first time ever, who are raging upset with KMD for the decision, and want to see it fail. That's not healthy for the coin or the community, even if its an extremely acute minority of the community. I know this might sound like heresy, but not all decisions can be tech first, community last like this one has been.

[28-Jun-18 01:42 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I certainly do appreciate the conversation about it though

[28-Jun-18 01:43 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Sorry about the off topic tangent with CG, not everyone locks up their trolls at night üòâ

[28-Jun-18 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"But if you unnecessarily alienate and marginalize supporters, you start working against your own best interests."
For the love of crypto, stop conflating miners and the actual support of the coin and the tech.

[28-Jun-18 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it would not me surprised if, statistically, 99% of the supporters of any coin (other than Bitcoin) couldn't mine the coin if you gave them the equipment and set the miner up for them

[28-Jun-18 01:53 PM] xRobeSx#5136
It would be great if you could bring people like that here @Beetcoin vs you having to accept all of their messages and relay into here and back etc. I'm not against open discussion and such. I just feel like if people really believed in KMD, they wouldn't be outraged over the decision.

[28-Jun-18 01:53 PM] Beetcoin#9049
From the sounds of it, there are, but feel like they don't have a voice here if they are filling up my DMs with commentary.

[28-Jun-18 01:54 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And I mean ultimately, if jl777 isn't going to do anything other than what he's decided, I can see why they don't bring it up

[28-Jun-18 01:54 PM] Beetcoin#9049
ü§∑

[28-Jun-18 01:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
James is open to listening to the community and has stuck to things people have decided on in the past. It would be better for all of us to just wait til he's back, as I'm 100% sure he will come in here and post his technical reasoning as to why its the right thing for KMD to do. 

If people wanna argue it with him, then go for it and we'll see. But I know he does have technical reasoning, so that should make the supporters lurking here that don't wanna speak up, believe in him. or give them something to talk about

[28-Jun-18 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
IMO, the whole last 7.5 hours is
It's nice shun-shiny weather outside, why isn't someone willing to do something to stop such a beautiful day since I make more money when it rains.

[28-Jun-18 01:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
now i really gotta get something done, nice talk @Beetcoin hah i hope you continue to support KMD no matter the decision

[28-Jun-18 01:57 PM] Beetcoin#9049
From the sounds of it, the technical reason is "more nethash"

[28-Jun-18 01:58 PM] Beetcoin#9049
But with complete disregard for community support

[28-Jun-18 01:58 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Sure thing @xRobeSx

[28-Jun-18 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"But with complete disregard for community support"
How much of "the community" do you suppose is comprised of GPU miners alone?

[28-Jun-18 02:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Looking to join your ranks, gentlemen

[28-Jun-18 02:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fighting through bitmain shit and shipping requirements

[28-Jun-18 02:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Would rather not give them my ssn

[28-Jun-18 02:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Anyone use customs brokers?

[28-Jun-18 02:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
USSA crew that is

[28-Jun-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Not sure any hobby miner would go through a 3rd party like that (even less sure that many would know how)

[28-Jun-18 02:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I probably need to slow down

[28-Jun-18 02:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I haven‚Äôt even dumped my shitcoins for BTC to pay for the z9‚Äôs yet

[28-Jun-18 02:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doing all this shit off of my phone in my truck

[28-Jun-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[28-Jun-18 02:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs how I roll

[28-Jun-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
just don't roll into a guardrail üòú

[28-Jun-18 02:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Parked on site

[28-Jun-18 02:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Crews squared away

[28-Jun-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just trying to fight my way to financial independence

[28-Jun-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And not have the no-knock door kickers flashbang my kids at 3am

[28-Jun-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
LMAO
I'm afraid of Republicans at 3am too

Randpaulian when it comes to that

[28-Jun-18 03:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What did I just miss

[28-Jun-18 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
?

[28-Jun-18 03:07 PM] jansako#3330
I did, sorry misread your comment

[28-Jun-18 03:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Think I was dumping out?

[28-Jun-18 03:07 PM] jansako#3330
nope

[28-Jun-18 03:08 PM] jansako#3330
thought you are paying for Z9 with USD.

[28-Jun-18 03:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No

[28-Jun-18 03:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC from shitcoin sales

[28-Jun-18 03:08 PM] jansako#3330
yeah, that is why I said sorry.

[28-Jun-18 03:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Np

[28-Jun-18 03:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Might have to dip into some KMD üòû

[28-Jun-18 03:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not much though

[28-Jun-18 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is selling way too much KMD for his liking to buy minis_

[28-Jun-18 03:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well

[28-Jun-18 03:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What generates more

[28-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Kmd interest or a z9

[28-Jun-18 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
exactly, it's a risk but a calculated one

[28-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah, price and hashrate could moon

[28-Jun-18 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If I'm wrong, my profits for last year =0

[28-Jun-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If I'm right, my profits next year = moon

[28-Jun-18 03:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
True

[28-Jun-18 03:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Laying out for these, assuming they‚Äôre even 50% as profitable when I finally receive them

[28-Jun-18 03:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Goes a long way toward unfucking my current situation

[28-Jun-18 03:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or maybe z9 is cancelled due to Zec hardfork

[28-Jun-18 03:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And we will be Kings of KMD hashrate

[28-Jun-18 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[28-Jun-18 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
how many blocks is the f4a supposed to be?

[28-Jun-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
64, right?

[28-Jun-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
fek me, rolling brownouts

[28-Jun-18 03:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gen with UPS backup?

[28-Jun-18 03:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Rather UPS with battery back-up and back up gen

[28-Jun-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
for 240v? I'm too poor for that shit

[28-Jun-18 03:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ha, just going off how they‚Äôre set up where I work

[28-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Lose utility, watch the fuckers scramble when a gen doesn‚Äôt fire up

[28-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Battery back-up being good for maybe 10 minutes of facility load

[28-Jun-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's a struggle, here, to get anything higher than a dual 200amp service, much less what I really need

[28-Jun-18 03:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Considered relocation?

[28-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Of course, not sure about long term sustainability of mining in the USSA

[28-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Seems everything bleeds down in profit eventually

[28-Jun-18 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Considered relocation?"
never

[28-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Mining consolidated in countries with cheap/‚Äúfree‚Äù power

[28-Jun-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'll close it all up and sell parts for scrap before I move

[28-Jun-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
