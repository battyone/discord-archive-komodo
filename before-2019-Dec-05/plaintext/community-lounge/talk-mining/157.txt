you just have to find the distance back to the first trigger in the unbroken sequence

[07-Aug-19 03:55 PM] zawy#5864
Then apply my last equation above where 1, 2, 3, is 1, 2, 3 blocks into the trigger state

[07-Aug-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, first let me get the I state working, for some reason it isnt triggering when it should yet. i just use the first 3 blocks after outeri?

[07-Aug-19 03:58 PM] zawy#5864
what is outeri?

[07-Aug-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the block that triggered the outer check

[07-Aug-19 04:00 PM] zawy#5864
first i is 
ts[0]-ts[outeri+w-1] 
 2nd is 
ts[0]-ts[outeri+w-2]

[07-Aug-19 04:00 PM] zawy#5864
and so on

[07-Aug-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so then there is the set of cumulative solvetimes for the entire range

[07-Aug-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
average them all?

[07-Aug-19 04:02 PM] zawy#5864
1/W

[07-Aug-19 04:02 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[07-Aug-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
1/(outeri+W) ?

[07-Aug-19 04:03 PM] zawy#5864
see my last equation about and I think it will help enlighten what this thing is doing

[07-Aug-19 04:03 PM] zawy#5864
oh, no, misubnderstood your question

[07-Aug-19 04:04 PM] zawy#5864
you don't need to average, yuo already showed the correct check   
``` if ( (ts[0] - ts[outeri+W]) < (outeri+W)*T )```
The inner equation is only averaging W st's

[07-Aug-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
current version has a bug with seeing the first O, but from when it activates it seems to be doing reasonably well:

[07-Aug-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
819 seconds over last 16 blocks vs T of 960

[07-Aug-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
now it is triggering in a way i can understand

[07-Aug-19 04:11 PM] zawy#5864
it looks like it's jumping up and down too much.   If there's not any error in the implementation, we may need to go back to your method by removing one of the solvetimes/T from the target adjusment

[07-Aug-19 04:11 PM] zawy#5864
but that's kind of a last resort....i want my math to be correct so we're not guessing

[07-Aug-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
1115 vs 1320, not closing the final gap

[07-Aug-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but diff is up to 20!

[07-Aug-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
exp never triggered

[07-Aug-19 04:14 PM] zawy#5864
it did seem bizarre that my math was saying the actual target for 3xT was 4x easier.....intuitively, it still seems like the miner's hashrate is about 2x higher than the target implies, so it seems like my original ctB = ctA/2 is what it should be

[07-Aug-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and it reached end of past

[07-Aug-19 04:15 PM] zawy#5864
how far back do you check for the original i?

[07-Aug-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
within past (20 blocks)

[07-Aug-19 04:16 PM] zawy#5864
OK, let me see the rest of the blocks and let me think about it before youtweak

[07-Aug-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the first outer trigger slowed the blocks down while the diff adjusted to where it should be

[07-Aug-19 04:17 PM] zawy#5864
I need to see all the blocks from at least 44

[07-Aug-19 04:19 PM] zawy#5864
can you modify the script to output target in decimal?

[07-Aug-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
sure. decimal in tenths, so just remove the . ?

[07-Aug-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw a case where the outer triggered, but it couldnt be solved, so it was as if it didnt happen. i will add a special case for that to make sure if outer triggers, it will at least keep the bnTarget twice as difficult

[07-Aug-19 04:46 PM] zawy#5864
it's rpetty remarkable to have that and the solvetimes come out reasonably well

[07-Aug-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i think now it is finally working close to the way you envisioned it. no idea what it was doing before

[07-Aug-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i am seeing the time that it needs to make up and think maybe if that isnt shrinking, we can go more aggressive

[07-Aug-19 04:49 PM] zawy#5864

averaging with previous one would smooth it out pretty well

[07-Aug-19 04:51 PM] zawy#5864
The last 3 are averaged already. This is the most difficult case to get right.  I want to do it from theory before any tweaking

[07-Aug-19 04:51 PM] zawy#5864
I expected it to be right in 4 blocks

[07-Aug-19 04:51 PM] zawy#5864
I mean, at block 68

[07-Aug-19 04:52 PM] zawy#5864
I mean 71

[07-Aug-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
problem i am seeing is that when the miners get lucky and quickly solve a high diff, it gets things a bit confused. there is a bug in the code with the early blocks

[07-Aug-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
until you see the RST activated in 2 or more, it seems it isnt working right in the state machine. my next run had the same problem with an isolated O at 65, and no I after, even though it should. not a problem with the math

[07-Aug-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt catching up due to some crazy fast solves

[07-Aug-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i want to make the min diff increase get stricter based on the time deficit

[07-Aug-19 04:54 PM] zawy#5864
Actually, I cheated a little on that target adjustment......it's supposed to be a little slow catching up

[07-Aug-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i know the math is doing that, but if it isnt working, it needs more diff

[07-Aug-19 04:54 PM] zawy#5864
because I didn't let the math make it as difficult as much as it should be

[07-Aug-19 04:55 PM] zawy#5864
No, i deviated from the math a little to give the simple ctB adjustment....it deviates from that equation on the fast solves....let me look at the error.

[07-Aug-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it needs to be 50% more difficult and it should work very well

[07-Aug-19 04:56 PM] zawy#5864
OK, but I need to see good data.  Is that bug affecting what I see up to ht 92?   Can you give me all data back to 44?

[07-Aug-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the next test run is almost done, i will get you complete data

[07-Aug-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
still has an inner detection bug, but other than the pre-68 blocks , i think it worked pretty well, against a 15 core mining

[07-Aug-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but a few lucky solves (6 seconds for 100 diff) made it fall behind and it couldnt catch up.

[07-Aug-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is climbing and it is making slow progress, so that is fantastic

[07-Aug-19 04:59 PM] zawy#5864
solves faster than 6 seconds are where I cheated on the math

[07-Aug-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but with 20 blocks i dont think it will close the remaining gap

[07-Aug-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
130 seconds to catch up, only 2 blocks to go

[07-Aug-19 05:03 PM] zawy#5864
Oh no, the equation adjustment is correct

[07-Aug-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810

latest test run

[07-Aug-19 05:10 PM] zawy#5864
I want W=3 to correct 1e6 attacks in   about 10  blocks.  It should go out of triggered state and revert to digishield, possibly even without triggering exp() due to the solvetime*solvetime.....which I just realized is like you were doing.  The difference is that solvetime is not just tipdiff, but tipdiff * recent solves.

[07-Aug-19 05:11 PM] zawy#5864
So if my math is correct, we have a proper way of using t^2

[07-Aug-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
probably it works much better for the 1E6 cases, than the 5x to 15x

[07-Aug-19 05:12 PM] zawy#5864
I need to fuigure out why it's not catching up better

[07-Aug-19 05:12 PM] zawy#5864
did you delete a CSV file?

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem when it doesnt trigger is that it only has the turtle slow digishield, so by not adjusting the diff all the way during the inner RST, it ends up in a very bad place to rely on digishield

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] zawy#5864
oh, there it is

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
mining.csv file is still there

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] zawy#5864
yeah, that's fine because once we get this right, W=6 and 12 should automatically correct

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i will add a panic factor to see if i can get it to converge faster while you work out the magic math

[07-Aug-19 05:14 PM] zawy#5864
Just change the divide by 3 to 4

[07-Aug-19 05:14 PM] zawy#5864
in i

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] zawy#5864
that will make it 33% harder

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so (W+1) instead of W

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] zawy#5864
hmmm

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] zawy#5864
that's sort of like (W-1)/W

[07-Aug-19 05:15 PM] zawy#5864
but I'm not supposed to do that on rolling average

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] zawy#5864
The average of the 20 blocks was 57 seconds.  I just realized the math I used to write the equation was just to find the correct difficulty, not to catch up.  This is perfect......now we can decide how fast we want it to catch up

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] zawy#5864
It's possible that this will have the correct difficulty 2 blocks after 1  million x attack

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] zawy#5864
I mean the 5th or 6th block , 2 or 3 blocks after the 3 trigger it

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] zawy#5864
exp() may not be needed.  Digi may not be needed.

[07-Aug-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
RST seems like it matches how people look at solvetimes

[07-Aug-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i like a 100% RST to calculate bnTarget for all blocks

[07-Aug-19 05:41 PM] zawy#5864
since it changes difficulty during the block, and it only needs 3 past blocks it's a lot smarter than people can be.

[07-Aug-19 05:42 PM] zawy#5864
Maybe W=4 is smoother will be less insane

[07-Aug-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, any single block can do stuff like solve a 1000 diff in 9 seconds

[07-Aug-19 05:43 PM] zawy#5864
This makes my warnings more serious.  Miners coming at the end of a block and messing with even 2-second difference in due to FTL  open  up loopholes

[07-Aug-19 05:44 PM] zawy#5864
Let me give example

[07-Aug-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i understand

[07-Aug-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but the diff change over 2 seconds is not that bad. more concerned with backdating and gaining a lot

[07-Aug-19 05:46 PM] zawy#5864
Big miner capable of solveing a T= 4  will assign a T=2 which will make next difficulty 4x easier than his hashrate ....but it responds so fast....I'm not sure it's much of a problem.  The big risk is miners coming on for only 1 or 2 blocks and leaving for 1 or 2 blocks

[07-Aug-19 05:47 PM] zawy#5864
but it's so amazing somone has to give this a try

[07-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we are well on the way to solving the DAA problem

[07-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
my next test run is catching up faster, just 90 seconds to make up, though only 3 blocks to do it in
