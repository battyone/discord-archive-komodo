i there i just set up my software for mining kmd:
if my: deamon logs: ___2019-05-20 07:35:56 InvalidChainFound: ___
can this happen or are my configs wrong_ iam hashing with 4x z11 to a z-nomp-pool
znomp log: found block but rejected by deamon
thx for short info

[20-May-19 08:35 AM] dandy_sandy#0536
is this diff setup okay for 150ksols z11:
        "3333": {
            "tls":false,
            "diff": 0.5,
            "varDiff": {
                "minDiff": 0.5,
                "maxDiff": 70,
                "targetTime": 15,
                "retargetTime": 60,
                "variancePercent": 30
            }
        },

@dandy_sandy invalidchainfound is no bueno, sounds like your pool is messed up

[20-May-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like maybe a wrong block template

[20-May-19 12:30 PM] dandy_sandy#0536
Ok. Do i have to edit the blocktemplate in the pool(znomp)? Thank you..

[20-May-19 12:31 PM] cipi#4502
```{
    "name": "kmd",
    "symbol": "kmd",
    "algorithm": "equihash",
    "txfee": 0.00005,
    "sapling": true
}```
is my kmd.json... i guess you forgot to set `"sapling": true`

[20-May-19 12:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@cipi is that "txfee" the min txfee your pool will allow in a block it mines?

[20-May-19 12:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
you might say I study zcash protocol coin fee markets 😅

[20-May-19 12:32 PM] cipi#4502
it doesn't really matter, afaik it is only used for payouts, but i am not doing any payouts 😉

[20-May-19 12:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@cipi cool, i was wondering, because i haven't seen that kind of cutoff before

[20-May-19 12:33 PM] SHossain#0007
without `"sapling": true` also worked out in my tests

[20-May-19 12:33 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess that might depend on which actual fork of z-nomp you are using

[20-May-19 12:34 PM] cipi#4502
yes, that is it... i use https://github.com/webworker01/knomp

@dandy_sandy use that knomp fork above

[20-May-19 12:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
or else you might have to change many little things

[20-May-19 12:35 PM] cipi#4502
maybe the difference is that some forks are setting spaling:true as default or something

[20-May-19 12:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
or the transaction version

[20-May-19 12:36 PM] cipi#4502
i thought the txversion is set by sapling:true... then it should be version 4... but i haven't looked into the code

@cipi i don't fully understand what all the nomp forks do, nor do i want to know 👼

[20-May-19 01:00 PM] cipi#4502
lol ... me neither... i was once trying to understand what the difference is between all these forks but i gave up

[20-May-19 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, every fork has something different. i got lost too 😄

[20-May-19 01:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
webworker's knomp is by far the most comprehensive out there. He has done a great job culminating a lot of work and also getting z payments working for privatechains

[20-May-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
sapling zaddr payouts is a very new exciting feature, it really brings some privacy to miners and helps the entire shielded pool of the coin

[20-May-19 01:52 PM] dandy_sandy#0536

from an FPGA discord, this is a really interesting custom "embedded FPGA" setup. In case you think FPGA miners are not in control of most networks......

[21-May-19 12:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
the daisy chained ethernet seems pretty smart

[21-May-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
with breakeven in ~4ish months and efficiency that blows everything else on the network away, it's like shooting fish in a barrel, when FPGAs compete with GPUs

here Anyone running a minining pool for KMD or any assetchains and you don't have a `Pool-Operator` role assigned, please let me know by posting here or by DM'ing me with your pool URL. I'll assign you role and will add your KMD pool in the pinned list on this channel. Existing @Pool-Operator can  change your nickname with your pool name if you like. And, please keep an eye here for important announcements and updates that you might have to do during the next month or so.

I dont know, I wanted to have some drinks with you ( Ewan ) @phm87 that Trainspotting movie changed my life  ( :

[21-May-19 06:20 PM] phm87#7395
I can't refuse a drink (I'm belgian). Have you ever see 'Requiem for a dream' ?

[21-May-19 06:24 PM] Caglio#3337
I did, but it was not that good as trainspotting, I loved the part where that black guy took his mamba out, and told that chick : What are you waiting for ? Its not gonna suck himself 😄

[21-May-19 06:26 PM] phm87#7395
I watched both but requiem was more shocking for me. About shocking movies, did you see 'american history x' ?

[21-May-19 06:26 PM] Caglio#3337

17K USD fee made some LTC miner very happy

Where did that money come from? "Mining"

[24-May-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It would be advisable to reach out to them as others have done in the past to resolve this issue if those behind the transaction wish to recover the fee.`
Be advised: If you do this on KMD, and chickenpool mines the block, then it sucks to be you 🙃

otherwise your node wouldn't even accept it to the memory pool

[25-May-19 05:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What'd you have to do to it?

[25-May-19 05:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also why is it hard coded to reject absurd fees? To protect people from fucking it away with fat fingers?

[25-May-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka it's meant to protect average users from paying fees larger than the amount they are sending

[25-May-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka z_sendmany also has similar code

[25-May-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I can see it's value to attempt to prevent users from making xtns

[25-May-19 02:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
But once it's in the mempool, the code seems misguided. Of course mining pools are going to comment that shit out

[25-May-19 02:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
I feel that it should be a CLI option, so KMD pools don't have to patch their code

[25-May-19 02:18 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It protects average users through stopping other nodes accepting your transaction?

[25-May-19 02:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
If I were a pool op, I would run the code that makes me the most money

[25-May-19 02:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka if everybody followed the rule, yes. But obviously, that is not going to happen

[25-May-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
It only takes one person to comment it out, then everybody else is incentivized to do the same

[25-May-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka some RPC's prevent transactions from ever getting to the mempool, because fee > amount. I think that is reasonable

[25-May-19 02:19 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah that is

[25-May-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
If you want something like that, make a raw transaction
