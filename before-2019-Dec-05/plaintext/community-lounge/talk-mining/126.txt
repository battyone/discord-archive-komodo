fixed, thanks
I knew there'd be some small silly thing I'd screw up copying the template over 😦

we're using freq 5

[26-May-19 08:37 AM] Alright#0419
5-10 minutes I'd say, should ever be 30

[26-May-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
Also the `Network Hash/s:` number is garbage for LABS

[26-May-19 08:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depends on how many blocks are in between

[26-May-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
can you help us figure out some way to get an accurate estimate?

[26-May-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
ac_staked fucks with "networksols"

[26-May-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
really not sure how to get an accurate estimate

[26-May-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
` Network Hash/s: 4.79 KSol/s ` I can tell you there is *at least* 12x this 😂

[26-May-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
I have 60ksol on it and I'm no where close to getting all the POW blocks

[26-May-19 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure there's any even remotely easy way to estimate a dual chain

[26-May-19 08:42 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r think you know ac_staked pretty well... any idea how to get a hashrate estimate?

[26-May-19 08:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I have 60ksol on it and I'm no where close to getting all the POW blocks`
I assume you're getting more since my pool went live?

[26-May-19 08:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
overnight, with you trowing 60, there was likely ~600

Hi guys. I'm new here. I was hodling some KMD, but decided to mine it starting from today.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I tried and failed very badly attempting that . Gave up fast.

[26-May-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r at attempting what?

[26-May-19 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
estimating for PoS/PoW hash rate?

[26-May-19 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. 
The RPC that does it, uses the block ahshes, and making it simply skip the PoS blocks, made it so that it had either the wrong amount of blocks to calc average, or resulted in some ridiculuosly large number because the expected time was longer than it rally was if that makes any sense.

[26-May-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in short block times change a lot on staking chains, becaus stakers stake blocks 60s into future.... so you need a whole new diff calc algo, and I just dont know how to do that tbh.

[26-May-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only way I could see doing it would involve an identifying tag on the block and a bunch of math that would likely create more lag than it would be worth

[26-May-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a flag for POS vs POW blocks in the block index, doing that would be extremly fast. The entire chain of OUR takes less thana  second to loop whole index.

[26-May-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If someone else can tell me in psudo code what math needs to be done.... I can try it. 
Somethign like 
`if PoS block skip this block... while still counting 100 blocks.`

[26-May-19 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then each block that was skipped you need to afjust the time... its never going to be 100% right becuiase the block times are all over the place.

[26-May-19 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```time =0, lastBlockTime=time_of_last_block, PoWblocks=0
for x = 1 to 100
get block info
if PoS then
    lastBlockTime = ThisBlockTime
    next x
else
    PoWblocks += 1
    some var/array about diff
    newTime = timeNow - lastBlockTime
    totalTime = totalTime + newTime
    lastBlockTime = newTime
next x
do math of num PoW blocks over PoW active Time with stored diff info```
ish

[26-May-19 04:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok once I finish beating my head into the C++ compiler I'll see if I can work it out.

[26-May-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
basically it's the same as it would be done if PoS never existed nor did the time that PoS took up

[26-May-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if the last 15 minutes were all PoS, then that 15 minutes never existed

[26-May-19 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what it needs to do yes.

[26-May-19 04:31 PM] Alright#0419
can try a poc in python if that helps

[26-May-19 04:32 PM] Alright#0419
so you're saying normal diff calc but completely ignoring pos blocks?

[26-May-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, ignore the PoS blocks and "time jump" over the time they took

[26-May-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats what you need to do... I will be fastest in daemon bt a long long way. I can do it. shouldnt take long

[26-May-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it prints the PoW hash, you could externalize that to getmininginfo

[26-May-19 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think they want the average actual PoW difficulty. There is only one way to do that and thats with genies algo above. Deosnt look that bad, I just need to skip the PoS blocks, and then remove the time between each of those also in the total.

[26-May-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it prints the actual PoW difficulty

[26-May-19 05:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can use the fuinction that calcs the pow diff for last 100 blocks... but it will take some mods so it always return the average... Hopefully this small edit to the RPC is all thats needed.

[26-May-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo_PoWtarget

[26-May-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
pass in the normal target, height and goalperc and it returns the diff PoW miners need to mine

[26-May-19 06:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the RPC doeesnt use that.. I would ned to rewrite it... All it does is check total chain PoW in last C blocks then divdes by how long it took to mine them.

[26-May-19 06:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats not what they are looking for, that is in GetBlockTemplate already

[26-May-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be called for each of the last N blocks and averaged

[26-May-19 06:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iuts just some silly hash/ps disaplay... I asked about this moneths ago and was told not to wrry about it, now we launched every9ne is whineing about it 😂

[26-May-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, probably to do with our mindiff being different from zcash mindiff

[26-May-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and everything is based on mindiff

[26-May-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this RPC is very strange... almost makes no sense.. I think this will get close. If not they can doit externally with a script... take 100x longer to run though

[26-May-19 08:16 PM] Gleb#9356
Tell me where are all the pools information about common hestate network. Thank you in advance.

[26-May-19 09:25 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You can look at the pinned message in this channel for a list of pools. Is that what you were after?

[27-May-19 11:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🐔 ChickenPool will experience  several restarts throughout the day 🐔 
These restarts will be to incorporate a codebase change that will allow for all coinbase transaction types and combinations while still using a proper template.
As always, make sure you have failovers set on your miners.

Well to be fair isn’t supposed to start shipping until today.    At 1588 was a great price,  half tempted to flip them as soon as they get here.  Can’t get a Z11 without paying out the wazoo for it

[28-May-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you ever sell that 2 dozen Z9s?

[28-May-19 09:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Still mining with them lol ,  4-5,5 $ a day each

[28-May-19 09:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
X3s  tanked  though ,  down to like a quarter a day each so it balanced out

[28-May-19 09:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I have one spoken for, for when I downsize but taking a look at eBay they still are selling well. So going to wait a bit more .

[28-May-19 09:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
To eBay the rest

[28-May-19 09:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Even minis are still going for like 125-160 still it’s crazy

Are you still doing the mining farm poly?

[28-May-19 11:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes for now,  but probably going to downgrade when my term is up.

I have a 2nd electric service in my place so can run most of it from home if I offload some,  electric rate will be a little more but what I save on rent will be more than worth it

We need some people to help out in mining the CHIPS chain with their asics. Does anyone have unprofitable miners that are shutdown at the moment that they can lend towards this effort? Can pay the electricity costs if not too crazy

[29-May-19 10:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@blackjok3r you got any? 😃

[29-May-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Do you still have free electric? 😄

[29-May-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol no not for a long long time, I did buy a heap of solar panels, but they dont quite cover the entire power bill so dont probide any freee mining powqer 😦

[29-May-19 10:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
know any miners atm?

[29-May-19 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope 😦

[29-May-19 11:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@hyperDEX what is up with CHIPS? does CG keep stalling the chain?

[29-May-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
why would it ever be the responsibility of a single person to keep the chain running?

[29-May-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i meant to say that CG *purposefully* stalls chains to teach "lessons", which he has described before. Not that it was his job to keep it unstalled

[29-May-19 12:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
CHIPS is dealing with a problem not many, if any, chains have had to deal with yet

[29-May-19 12:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is, being at the point where the rewards are tiny

[29-May-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, how we solve it might serve as the reference for doing it right (or wrong) however it turns out

[29-May-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` i meant to say that CG purposefully stalls chains to teach "lessons"`
I've only ever did that once and it was CURE coin 😕

[29-May-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
their response was to remove PoW rather than fix the diff 🤷🏽

[29-May-19 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User what year and model of "Vega XFX"?

[29-May-19 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you have every right to switch to and from any coin you choose, i wasn't saying it disrespectfully. But I vaguely remembered some AC's which would stall whenever your rigs switched away or did something else. It's a great way to point out that a certain network is not decentralized enough

[29-May-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the AC issues were more of the fact that I was free-mining them with a GPU while most folks were set to on-demand via daemon and any time I went offline it took a while for CPUs to hit that diff after a tx existed

[29-May-19 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's just a simple fact that when no one mines a chain, the chain doesn't move 🤷🏽

[29-May-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 agreed. when the wind stops blowing, the windmill stops turning. Everything is fine
