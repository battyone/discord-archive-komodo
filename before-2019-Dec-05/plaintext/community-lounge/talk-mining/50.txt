once it's running stable, it should usually run about 1/2 that loud

[03-Oct-18 07:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was laughing at her look on miner 😅

[03-Oct-18 07:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

did you put his pool in the 1st slot?

[03-Oct-18 07:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I had put mine. now I put his pool details

[03-Oct-18 07:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Slot 1 = the pool you really, really want to mine in
Slot 2 = the pool you want to mine in if pool 1 is offline
and so on

cool! on turbo, this miner can peak to 52 ksol/s 🤔

I guess I can buy that second cooler master psu tomorrow 😉

[03-Oct-18 08:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will let this miner running until wife gets mad 😄

[03-Oct-18 08:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

that's the noise level

[03-Oct-18 08:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and most of it is from miner fans. cooler master is cool!

[03-Oct-18 08:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess I can change miner fans ?

[03-Oct-18 08:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see those showing ~6200 rpm

[03-Oct-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
got command from wife: turn off miner.

[03-Oct-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[03-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I wonder if something like this will work https://www.amazon.com/Silverback-Sound-Dampening-Foam-Thick/dp/B00MAQNAPY

[03-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I've never tried it myself since I don't mind the noise 😄

[03-Oct-18 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$36 to cover 1m x 1.3m 
you'd be better off building a new building out in the yard and planning to expand 😉

Hey all! Do you know when mining KMD will be available through Argo Mining?

[03-Oct-18 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is an agro miner (at least according to the millennials) and has KMD available all the time_

[03-Oct-18 07:40 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Pirate Hash Rate
```Network Hash/s: 74.44 MSol/s
 Difficulty: 326858626.51```
Wow

[03-Oct-18 07:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's big

[03-Oct-18 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's 6.5x the block diff of KMD big

[03-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jansako#3330
soon the profitability of Pirate (at current prices) will be the same as KMD,

[03-Oct-18 08:11 PM] jansako#3330
will the hash go down or price up?

[03-Oct-18 08:12 PM] jansako#3330
(throws another 0.1 MSol at it 😃 )

[04-Oct-18 07:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
went out from home leaving miner on. 
came back to a surprising cozy home. all rooms. 😅

[04-Oct-18 07:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna turn on my second miner in few minutes 😃

[04-Oct-18 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in about 8 hours this single miner earned ~52 pirate 😃

[04-Oct-18 07:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
52 / 8 = 6.5 * 24 = 156 pirate is estimated expectation for 24 hrs 🤔

[04-Oct-18 07:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
156 * 0.10 = $15.6 😦

[04-Oct-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah looks good

[04-Oct-18 07:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And it should be a loop as it shows in picture 
Right?

[04-Oct-18 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay tested by turning it on
It didn’t blow

[04-Oct-18 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[04-Oct-18 12:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
unfortunatly I won't be mining pirate or do any mining, until either I could move these miners to some other place than my little living place or may be until we move to a new place where have a room for my computer stuff. 😦

[04-Oct-18 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
we both feeling well after medicine. both had got headache.

[04-Oct-18 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but it was fun playing with these miners for whatever many hours I could 😁

[04-Oct-18 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll trade you 301.16160806 ARR for the both of them :trollface:

[04-Oct-18 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks mate. I'll keep'em for a fun time future 😉

[04-Oct-18 12:22 PM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder i can safekeep for you 😃

[04-Oct-18 12:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
been already searching a new place to move in. the miners kinda pushing for that search a lil harder 😄

[04-Oct-18 12:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain come here then 😉

a bomb shelter would be good

[04-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
how loud would 6000 z9 mini in a room be?

[04-Oct-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
minis not overclocked run at @ 2-3k fan speeds, so about as loud as 9-10k S9s fwiw

[04-Oct-18 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so compared to a jumbo jet ?

[04-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you have 2 devices that do 60db each, is the end noise 120db, or how does that work? I assume the sound is somewhat amplified but not 1:1?

[04-Oct-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
db are logarithmic

[04-Oct-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure, but maybe 1000x adds 30db?

[04-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In the end they measure db of a container and it reads about 80db outside of the fan

[04-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
of such a container

[04-Oct-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But in the very beginning he's filming from inside such a container and it seems way louder than 80db

[04-Oct-18 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's kinda deceptive due to where he's holding the camera

[04-Oct-18 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the short answer is that 6k minis will be quieter than 3k S9s
exactly how much quieter? Ask me again next year 😝

[04-Oct-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean 2 of them gave satinder headaches

[04-Oct-18 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
his aren't minis

[04-Oct-18 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
just trying to imagine 6000 of them

[04-Oct-18 02:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[04-Oct-18 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, ok, still just 2?

[04-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess being deaf might be an advantage to being a miner

[04-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
thermodynamics will cause a Z9 to be louder than 2 minis, even with the same 2 fans; heat, volume, etc.

[04-Oct-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they need more RPMs in 1 box than 2

[04-Oct-18 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
on  a hashrate basis it is 4x?
