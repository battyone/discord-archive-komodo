just fake shares and let the payment processor figure it out

[10-Nov-18 10:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh yeah makes sense ... never really uses a payment processor so dunno how that works

[10-Nov-18 10:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anyway the JSON to pass mode isnt working need to figure that out so web cna get a pool working with it that isnt butchered.

and he daemone must be using -pubkey. You can set it with `setpubkey` RPC from the pool iteslf if you like, so it uses the correct pool address from the config files.

[10-Nov-18 10:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although you would need to convert the address to pubkey first, however, the pool already calls validate address, so you probably have this somwhere.

[10-Nov-18 10:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks a lot if you can figure this out.

[10-Nov-18 10:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Thanks a lot if you can figure this out.`
@blackjok3r maybe post a doc somewhere of exactly what you're wanting? (preferably without something you've started with a custom daemon)

[10-Nov-18 10:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All u need is an option to make the pool use that template.. The commit shows which code in the pool needs to be removed to make the template work

[10-Nov-18 10:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It's backwards compatible so can be merged  to kmd without issues

[10-Nov-18 11:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`to make the pool use that template.` That's my point, short of using your custom daemon I have no idea (nor will anyone else) what "that template" is...

[11-Nov-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It has to use the custom daemon without it the hashblockmarkleroot is always wrong

[11-Nov-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I'm fixing this one myself.... Will wait for web for a while its not like he doesn't sleep lol.

[11-Nov-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha the part that will need "fixing" is the payment processor

[11-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that should be eaier for others to work out than what I am doing, seems no one understands what I am doing 🤣

The only thing that changing any Equihash K&N values will ever do as far as making any coin "ASIC resistant" is change the RAM requirements of any given ASIC.
If there is enough demand, someone will make a 20GB RAM ASIC with variable K,N, and pers values and remove any such "resistance"
All of the valued Komodo assetchains (including PIRATE) have 51% resistance (which is the real requirement) due to dPoW and none of them have any need to make changes to the algo that are cumbersome to users and/or remove the ability to have some miners even be able to mine them.

I already got it all working.. but will have a look at them

[12-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can keep the stratum stuff..

[12-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just pass the daemons coinbase directly into the block

[12-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than let/make the stratum software make the coinbase tx

[12-Nov-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just have some silly code left to make sure the correct -pubkey is set in the daemon, as if the pools addres != the -pubkey address the pool wont receive any payments.

[12-Nov-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have all the data in the pool, and got the stratum software to use the setpubkey RPC to set the pubkey... I wish there was a function that coverted Raddress -> btcpubkey 😦 cant find one in iguana/supernet or komodo code base

[12-Nov-18 01:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I just happened to think of the fact that you py and that it's a ton more lightweight than modern implimentations

[12-Nov-18 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I wish there was a function that coverted Raddress -> btcpubkey`
it may take 2 calls, but I'm pretty sure there's a way in mm

[12-Nov-18 01:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe combine them

[12-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had a good look and it seems you need the private key... being a poo;l the private key should not be imported to the main daemon for preformance reasons

[12-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It currently does getinfo to get he pubkey, if that doesnt work, it does validate address on the pool address

[12-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if both return nothing it fails to start

[12-Nov-18 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can't make payments if you don't have the pk

[12-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181

not really messing with that part... i was hopeing for someone else to do that/

[12-Nov-18 01:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99% of pools are 1 wallet on the same server as pool

[12-Nov-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess thats how people do it... but they are stupid... as the pool can be stopped by a very cheap attack by doing that

[12-Nov-18 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why flooding wallet kills pool

[12-Nov-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I already made a solution to that 😄

[12-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Needs more testing.... but the wallet already accepts every single transaction sent on the chain, then filters what it wants

[12-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so i added more filters

[12-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea why someone didnt do that already

[12-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wasnt really that hard.

[12-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ExtractDestination will turn any scriptpubkey to an address.. .os you can blacklist or whitelist address's... and you can fitter vouts under a size ... whatever you want

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[12-Nov-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```-mintxvalue=<amount in sats>
This defualts to 1 coin, how it works is:
-- takes all the vouts in a transaction and counts which ones are to the notary nodes address (set with -pubkey=) 
-- Adds the value of these together (total in sats) try sending heaps of vouts to make a really large tx value and see if it crashes it?
-- Divides by the number of vouts, 
-- if the amount is less than this number the transacion is ignored, not added to wallet. This filter does not work with -rescan or importprivkey(?) so you can add them to wallet by doing a rescan if you need to.
-> if this number is 0, the wallet accetpts NO transactions ... once a notary is funded, likely this should be the setting you use. Only allowing to send from yourself, for iguana utxo split txs.


-whitelistaddress=RTVti13NP4eeeZaCCmQxc2bnPdHxCJFP9x
-- Set this along with -pubkey= to a valid staked notary, and it will let all txs from this address into the wallet, even if mintxvalue is set to 0.```

[12-Nov-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently only for notary nodes.. but no reason it cant work for anything wth a simple comand line arg to turn it on.

[12-Nov-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
address = base58(prefix + rmd160(sha256(pubkey))

[12-Nov-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can go from address to pubkey, you just destroyed crypto as we know it as both rmd160 and sha256 have to be broken

[12-Nov-18 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the probability that some private asic that are already mining the so-called asic resistant equihash chains is quite high

The speed of the order doesn't impact cost; you pay per valid share

[13-Nov-18 09:57 AM] jansako#3330
there is a setting that shows 'speed paying', and 'speed at pool', the second can be higher

[13-Nov-18 09:58 AM] jansako#3330

'speed at pool' also included valid rejected shares due to chain movement

at least it appears to be so, not sure of they 'reconcile' this eventually?

[13-Nov-18 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's a dozen reasons that the 2 numbers will never match

[13-Nov-18 10:01 AM] jansako#3330
right, so you don't think the bot 'asking' for a large hashrate, then suddenly dropping the order speed would get soem free hash? (yes, I know you said 'paid for hash delivered')?

[13-Nov-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"speed" is a thing that isn't actually measured, it's estimated
different layers estimate differently

[13-Nov-18 10:02 AM] jansako#3330
OK, so they just count shares, then do a calculation for shares over time to get an estimated 'hash speed' number?

[13-Nov-18 10:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sort of
at *x* difficulty, it should take *y* time to produce *z* hash
Based on that, hash is guessed at

[13-Nov-18 10:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
same as for networkhashrate (although here *z* is how many blocks), etc
