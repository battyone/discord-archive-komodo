any good pool advice ? was on suprnova, but as they decide not to send the forgotten password for weeks even after countless emails to admin, I'll just switch my rigs

Komodo Mining Pool
Komodo mining pool is a mining pool for mining Komodo (KMD), the first komodo pool and best on web. On komodominingpool.com you can mine with your CPUs and GPUs.

hi question i normally use xmr stack to mine monero based coins as i have a mixed amd and nvidia setup however i would like to mine kmd and its asset chains like Equaliser which miner would be best to use for this as it is an equihash algo

Is this what you're looking for? I use it for my Nvidia cards, works a treat

[18-Jun-18 08:46 AM] Cypher#9999
Will it support both AMD and Nvidia at the same time?

[18-Jun-18 08:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hey @Cypher just to let you know your role in discord is spelled wrong, 'Eqaulsier' instead of Equaliser, not sure if that's something that has to be changed by a kmd admin here though

YMMV with any miner
It wasn't too extensive (just under 2 hours), but on rigs as low as 3 1080TIs and as high as 13 1080TIs, I saw no discernible performance difference between dstm and EWBF (with 0 fee)

How many z9s did you end up buying?

[18-Jun-18 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
50 or 52, I'd have to add up the orders

OK, to be more specific, they haven't sent my 1st shipment yet; dunno if they've sent any or not

[18-Jun-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
afaik, none were supposed to ship out for another 2 days

[18-Jun-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm going to piss my pants laughing if BM adds K and N variables and the Z9s can still crush all of these coins changing values ahead of unknown software

[18-Jun-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think they have enough RAM for that.

[18-Jun-18 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
even if they don't and a RAM mod increases the price 10x, they're still set to punch out a greater ROI than GPUs

[18-Jun-18 02:15 PM] Alright#0419
BTCZ, the only coin to switch so far, has lost about 1/3 of it's hash rate

[18-Jun-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, that's a double edged value, because the changed K&N values make a more intense algo and sols go way down on every card

[18-Jun-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
iirc, a 1080TI on BTCZ is only getting like 50-60 Sol/s

[18-Jun-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so the numbers drop with that naturally

[18-Jun-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
__________
On the humor side of things, unsafe changed their K&N values because they are anti-Bitmain and they feel that the change also makes them "nicehash resistant" ðŸ˜‚

[18-Jun-18 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
Taking it that into consideration, what I meant is that their network lost about 1/3 of hardware actually mining it

[18-Jun-18 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
it's about a 15x decrease in sol/s

[18-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
for any given card

[18-Jun-18 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think that comes from 2 things:
1) profit switchers still on "regular" equihash
2) people that lack the ability to see that their drop from 700-60 is the same as everyone else's and their "loss" really isn't

[18-Jun-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
Also no AMD miner is released yet

[18-Jun-18 02:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Good morning.   Anyone here have some Bitmain Coupons?  Trying to order another pair of Z9s

[18-Jun-18 02:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I gave my last coupons away for free.   I din';t think I would order anymore.   I Was wrong.

[18-Jun-18 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only time I give away coupons is if there's less than a week left and I know I'm not getting any that week

[18-Jun-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Alright AMD sucks on equihash, just imagine how bad they suck on high RAM K&N values

[18-Jun-18 03:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Iâ€™ve got 50 KMD for a $250 coupon.

[18-Jun-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
280x are fine one equihash... but they are no good anymore, return loss even in elec

[18-Jun-18 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r not to mention 280x on Linux requires 14.04.2 ubuntu for drivers to work. I shut it off and mine Verus on my newer CPU, it's more speculative, but seems to be a much better future investment

[18-Jun-18 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright BTG has also changed their N+K

[18-Jun-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181

so, they changed from their own values to the same values the next set of ASICs will come out running ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Jun-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Lets all switch to 144 & 5, that way our efforts to be 'ASIC resistant' make it easier for ASIC manufacturers to target all of us"
Feken morons centralize around a set of numbers that makes it even easier to target more coins in order to "fight centralization"
As some point, all of the anti-Bitmain hate needs to give way to rationality ðŸ˜£

[18-Jun-18 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I see many zec forks that have plans to move to 144,5

[18-Jun-18 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't think it's very smart, either. They seem to be doing it so they don't need to write their own optimized miners and can use existing miners that support common (N,K) values

[18-Jun-18 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only thing that changing to the same KN values does is increase investment costs - profitability of ASICs with more RAM will not change

[18-Jun-18 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and the more that switch to the same K&N is the more likely that an ASIC for that K&N will come into being

[18-Jun-18 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or just put 4G of RAM in the damn thing and make K and N both a variable setting

[18-Jun-18 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
this very nice write up (but long) describes how Bitmain can most likely already follow forks with arbitrary (N,K), they probably use it for themselves already: https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b

[18-Jun-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
On the ridiculous side, even if adding RAM drove the price of an ASIC up 10x, it'd still be more profitable than the same amount of USD spent on GPUs

LF 2 Bitmain coupons.  Name your price ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Jun-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

@dukeleto much of that article echos what I've been trying to tell people, but that anti-Bitmain FUD runs deep and people can't accept logic and reason

I have a  $100 one too I am willing to swap for some KMD... make an offer...

[18-Jun-18 05:25 PM] jansako#3330
Weren't the Z9 minins supposed to ship between June 10 and 20th? Anyone here that has a 'shipped' order state?

[19-Jun-18 03:18 PM] BlackJesus#6161
computergenie hit a 5k komodo block. And the notaries already this year have hit a 9k a 5k nd like 2-3 2k blocks

[19-Jun-18 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
isn't zen one of the donkey coins that all migrated to the 2.5G RAM K&N values?

"computergenie hit a 5k komodo block." 1500

[19-Jun-18 03:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I don't think they did it yet they will be hardforking tommorow. And they are highlighting supernodes as the big advancement. Hell they may be renegging on it due to hush following zcash and zcash opting not to fork.

[19-Jun-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[19-Jun-18 03:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm definitely mining direct with the recent changes to the notary/miner balance and interest orphaning at 1 month opposed to a year starting at block 1million.

[19-Jun-18 03:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Orphan blocks are going to become the norm. If someone did a running average I'm almost certain it will eclipse atleast double the reward per block.

[19-Jun-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm betting that zcash never forks due to ASICs, I think the devs are smart enough to see the true value over the anti-Bitmain FUD and rhetoric
