the whole community of devs let some serious attack vectors happen because of convenience

I spent more than a decade as a VB coder, I can't knock any language/platform as a whole

[04-Dec-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I started in VB too... but I was a child

[04-Dec-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every thing has a use

[04-Dec-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nodejs

[04-Dec-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should nto eb used for misson cirtial apps involcing money :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 04:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Victoria Bitter?
That'd be some shit code

[04-Dec-18 04:43 AM] Alright#0419
if your nodejs solution requires prebuilt binaries from 200+ projects, it's entirely insecure

[04-Dec-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont want to even use it ...

[04-Dec-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a solution in python ...

[04-Dec-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we should use it

[04-Dec-18 04:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
VisualBasic runs more of the world than any maximalists of "real languages" will ever care to admit @NutellaLicka 😛

[04-Dec-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Are you doing yours in py genie ? or sticking with node ?

[04-Dec-18 04:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if vb4 and vb6 vanished tomorrow, 80% of the world's shipping would grind to a halt

[04-Dec-18 04:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Aha, it was a bad Australian joke. VB is an Australian beer :P I learnt VB code in school here, it was quite fun but I remember next to none of it.

👍 

[04-Dec-18 04:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm sticking with node, mostly because js is less for me to learn and I've honestly reached the age where I don't have the aptitude to proficiently learn new languages ☹

[04-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Alright#0419
please don't

[04-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Alright#0419
give me a minute, want to show you something

[04-Dec-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont remeber the code exactly either... but I still rember how I did stuff with it ... I wote an encription program in vb6 for a friend ... and a pong game with DX 😄

[04-Dec-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tried for weeks to make it work multiplayer over a network until I gave up.. then probably did no codeing for over 10 years I think.

nodejs is garbage, don't build anything mission critical on it unless you have the time to write it from scratch or hand check every dependency of every dependency of every dependency of every dependency of every dependency of every dependency of every dependency of every dependency

[04-Dec-18 04:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm well aware

[04-Dec-18 04:51 AM] Alright#0419
So learn python

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you come do all the other shit I need done (for free) and I'll stop everything and devote the time to learn py...

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Alright#0419
please see edit

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubtful anyone needs to learn py

[04-Dec-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its english :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
havent learnt any of it ... but made a few decent things in it before

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very very easy, if you ave a text editor that does all indents for you

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like stupidly easy

[04-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Alright#0419
it "just works"

[04-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Alright#0419
that's all I'm ever looking for

[04-Dec-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to re-test pool with spaling activation to ake sure it works sloothly, then look at this python pool and see what I can find ... I am well aware that I am pretty much destroying the stratum protocol by doing it this way, but if it makes it simper and works the same way, then it must be better.

[04-Dec-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and node is just bad... flat bad.

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Alright#0419
You need to follow stratum protocol

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Alright#0419
even if you build python pool

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` but if it makes it simper and works the same way, then it must be better.`
walking is simpler than owning a car and it gets you from pointA to PointB, is it better?

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Alright#0419
stratum protocol is good

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Alright#0419
is only viable solution atm

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only for the miner software... Genie said that using the daemons coinbase is breaking the stratum protocl

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
Just make it compatible with miner software

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however ... if the daemon builds hte coinbase the pool asks it to build ? is it still technicall the same ?

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
that's all that matters

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats ht eplan

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Genie said that using the daemons coinbase is breaking the stratum protocl`
no, the stratum protocol said that's breaking the stratum protocol

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
but those rely on stratum protocol

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
fuck the protocol

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right the pool right

[04-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
do legacy equihash miners work?

[04-Dec-18 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it does these things :
1) receivs PoW from miner software and gives out jobs
2) puts the pool fee in the coinbase
3) pays out payments based on shares

[04-Dec-18 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is there anyhting I am mising?

[04-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Alright#0419
the only thing that matters is that legacy miner software will continue to work

[04-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Alright#0419
IMO

[04-Dec-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So instead of taking the fee out on payment process like the one I made ... I can add an RPC to `setfee`

[04-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Alright#0419
so many things rely on that

[04-Dec-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cna take basically a sendmany JSON ... excatpt a % instead of an amount

[04-Dec-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems viable ... I'd rather leave it the way I had ti ... biut it does definatly over time, "steal" dust into the pool address due to js rounding liek a fool.

[04-Dec-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure python would fix that either ... wihtout complex code

[04-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Alright#0419
if the only drawback is combining dust, the pool OPs can deal with that

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the pool already does it ...

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
the positives easily outweigh that

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I know

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just means hte pool address ends up with some "free moeny" it shouldnt have

[04-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
What?

[04-Dec-18 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
somehow doing 100x0.01 and 100x0.99 dont equal each other

[04-Dec-18 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
ya think?

[04-Dec-18 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is something "left over"

[04-Dec-18 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not every time

[04-Dec-18 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
minimalizethat as much as possible

[04-Dec-18 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no like 
total mined x 0.01 + totalminedx0.99 != total mined

[04-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Alright#0419
so  100x0.999999999

[04-Dec-18 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if its just js math or a problem with math itself :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Alright#0419
if it's a single sat either way, it really won't matter

[04-Dec-18 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and there have been a fwe people who seem to think that the pool fee *MUST* come fromt eh coinbase for some reason.

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cna me more than a sat ... seen it be like 600sat at times ..

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to average out over time though...

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Alright#0419
Pool fee coming from cb is just what they're use to

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't mean it's better

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still says, "Operator error is not a bug"_

[04-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Alright#0419
😄

[04-Dec-18 05:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Pool fee coming from cb is just what they're use to`
Yes, and they are used to it because it's a fundamental part of the protocol

[04-Dec-18 05:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`fuck the protocol`
🤦🏽 the irony of that hurts my brain

[04-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
Joker built an objectively better solution than what the protocol calls for

[04-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
and still works with mining software that was built for the protocol

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Joker built an objectively better solution than what the protocol calls for`
*subjectively
but either way, it's not a stratum

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, stratum

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
Have you mined any ZEX?

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even jl said my idea was better thats 99% of th reason I even tried to do it

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
with your straum protocol miners?

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
zcash isn't bitcoin
because, bitcoin

[04-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
Did you mine any ZEX

[04-Dec-18 05:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I mined 2 blocks of ZEX with the one setup I had, yes

[04-Dec-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
web did make that wor in the end ... he cant mine LAMEDUCKs though

[04-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
So you realize that you violated the "protocol", right?

[04-Dec-18 05:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how so?

[04-Dec-18 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
How did you mine it?

[04-Dec-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i think webworker made it build coinbase with p2pk

[04-Dec-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh and it ahs to burn the fees

[04-Dec-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷
