one would think after this many years that you'd be a yaamp expert by now :trollface:

[29-Nov-18 11:24 PM] Alright#0419
would recommend asking around in PIRATE and VRSC channels for advice

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I know eh.... my brain just doesn't work in dev mode

[29-Nov-18 11:24 PM] Alright#0419
I'll be sending out info to pool OPs on how to be prepared for sapling shortly

[29-Nov-18 11:25 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it'll work with anything other than snomp or knomp though

[29-Nov-18 11:25 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
yeah probably not 😉

[29-Nov-18 11:25 PM] Alright#0419
You have your own custom stratum?

[29-Nov-18 11:25 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
yeah well.... it's a yiimp stratum

[29-Nov-18 11:25 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
that'd been customized

[29-Nov-18 11:26 PM] Alright#0419
zpool seems to me like a logistical nightmare, major props for being able to do what you do

[29-Nov-18 11:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not sure it'll work with anything other than snomp or knomp though`
the only difference is the coding language

[29-Nov-18 11:26 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
haha it's getting a bit out of hand I will admit 😉

[29-Nov-18 11:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright have you looked at miketout's fork of s-nomp?

[29-Nov-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
have not, why?

[29-Nov-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
need to test both snomp and knomp on sapling chains, so I can explain to pool ops how to be prepared

I've seen all the *nomp's but not much help for my stratum/pool as it's totally different

afaik, this one ^^ is ready as the guide says. Miketout also confirmed.

[30-Nov-18 12:19 AM] SHossain#0007
They are using it for Verus

I'm a bit out of the loop, and the komodoo site wont load on my phone or computer...but whats the deal with mining and the hard fork?

[30-Nov-18 02:35 AM] bishop#9773
update prior to 12/15

[30-Nov-18 02:42 AM] Ric of Ric & Thadeus#8816
what would i need to do on my end?

[30-Nov-18 02:44 AM] bishop#9773
update your daemon/wallet prior to the fork when the new version is out

hi guys, Komodo will fork to algo Verushash? and anti ASIC?

[30-Nov-18 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
No

[30-Nov-18 09:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What is happening is that Komodo is allowing assetchains to choose what algorithm to implement. Komodo itself is continuing to use equihash. 
I understand why you ask this question, there was some ambiguity in the announcement made.

Intel filed a patent which seems to be for ASIC processors: http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=10,142,098.PN.&OS=pn/10,142,098&RS=PN/10,142,098

[01-Dec-18 09:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Read to me more like an entire ASIC (even hardwiring 1/2 of what cgminer does) than just the processor

[01-Dec-18 10:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All of the "may"s in there read to me like intel wants to heve the only Bitcoin ASIC in the US

[01-Dec-18 10:42 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We were discussing with our main advisor @jl777c and other founding members about the mining of Marmara coin. It will use some Verus features in new Komodo fork. It will be a Verushash mineable coin with 50 % staking and 50 % of all blocks is planned to be timelocked between 3 months and 2 years. If decided, this 50%- timelock feature will be permanent policy. What would  a mining operator say about this? How would mining community and other users react to this? We are trying to find an optimum and just solution. Opinions?

[01-Dec-18 10:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is not a fan of mining out of pocket for `between 3 months and 2 years`_

[01-Dec-18 10:59 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 thanks. Is it for miner, or pool operator or both?

[01-Dec-18 11:00 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
And What percentage would be ok?

[01-Dec-18 11:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
both
Getting folks to join a pool is hard enough, but when you add "I can't pay you" to that, the coin itself has to have a unique draw like Verus itself does

[01-Dec-18 11:02 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 What do you mean by unique draw?

[01-Dec-18 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Verus is/was a totally unique thing that "everyone" wanted in on early
In order to sustain miners with timelocked rewards, you have to be unique enough to make them want to stop mining VRSC (or whatever else) and not get paid
While it's easier with CPU algo than GPU/ASIC, time and money are what they are

[01-Dec-18 11:18 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Marmara will also use Verushash and timelocked coins. Besides it will have 50% Verus staking. Those features are coming with new Komodo fork to Komodo.

[01-Dec-18 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
50% staking sounds great until one realizes that they have to wait out the timelock before they can stake (which actually means it's 100% mining for the 1st 3 months or up to 2 years)

[01-Dec-18 12:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
Anyone in here using easymine to manage their rigs?

[01-Dec-18 12:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
Or... can anyone recommend a good rig management platform?

[01-Dec-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrlynch it depends on what you're looking for and/or how much work you're willing to put into it

[01-Dec-18 12:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'm looking for something that allows me to monitor the temps of the miners and be able to switch pools easily

[01-Dec-18 12:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'm cureently using hiveos but was wondering if there's anything better.. saw easymine dot io is a lot cheaper the hive

[01-Dec-18 12:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
I only have asics btw

[01-Dec-18 12:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
Not that fussed about gpu functions at the moment

[01-Dec-18 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I really like https://github.com/cryptoGlance/cryptoGlance-web-app, but it's an old repo and some of the things need manual edits to work with newer miners

[01-Dec-18 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
minera?
never used them though

[01-Dec-18 12:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
Seems that minera is only for btc mining

[01-Dec-18 12:44 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. didn't know

[01-Dec-18 02:16 PM] jorian#4555
if i remember correctly, VRSC didn't have timelocked blocks right from the start

[01-Dec-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, that's what I mean, it's hard enough to get miners interested in a "new thing", but nearly impossible when they can do nothing with any of it for a time
(imo) locking from the start = only "rich" miners and "insiders" will do anything for quite a while

[01-Dec-18 02:32 PM] jorian#4555
what is the main reason for having timelocked blocks? why did VRSC do it?

[01-Dec-18 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no sure I ever understood any reason for doing it

[01-Dec-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
to prevent early devs/miners/speculators from dumping on the market, I think was miket's motivation

[01-Dec-18 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@B. Gültekin Çetiner timelocked blocks basically mean pools will not exist until time-locked blocks end

[01-Dec-18 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
most miners dislike timelocked blocks, I would venture to say

[01-Dec-18 11:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
i keep getting a negative diff on my asics (at the pool) 🤔

[01-Dec-18 11:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
that normal?

[01-Dec-18 11:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ummmm

[01-Dec-18 11:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[02-Dec-18 01:20 AM] mrlynch#5735
It's not all the time. Just short blips. When i refresh the worker page, every once in a while 1 of the asics is showing negative diff 🤔

[02-Dec-18 02:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you're on a nomp, it can sometimes say that, I don't believe it would actually be assigning a negative value though. It's most likely assigning the positive value of whatever is shown

[02-Dec-18 02:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
oh... ok... everything seems fine though... must be the pool then front end then

[02-Dec-18 02:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I've seen what you're talking about and the number shown (say -209000) is actually assigning 209000 as the difficulty.

[02-Dec-18 02:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not sure why it comes up as negative though

[02-Dec-18 10:10 AM] cryptoprofit#5528
how is new update going to affect mining if ya all go easy im a noob, reason i ask is as it is changing to vrsc hash will it be profitable to CPU mine ?

[02-Dec-18 10:12 AM] skyguynca#0562
I am running a private pool s-nomp. I am mining Komodo and found a block. For some reason instead of show the confirmations it just says pending.....anyone can help I would really appreciate it alot, thanks

[02-Dec-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@cryptoprofit KMD is not chaning to verushash, Komodo is adding the ability for new assetchains to use it

[02-Dec-18 10:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@skyguynca have you checked the hash on a block explorer to see if it was valid?

[02-Dec-18 11:40 AM] SHossain#0007
Anyone got sucess with setting up Sapling activated mining pool?

[02-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Nabob#5004

[02-Dec-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Nabob yes, I get that, but the only way to know the "for sure" answer is to 1st know if it was an actual block

[02-Dec-18 02:24 PM] Nabob#5004
@skyguynca  ☝

[03-Dec-18 04:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain for solo mining you should be able to use the pool of mine that ZEX is using ... it will just pass the whole block from deamon back to it wit a solution... but payouts may not work without some modification.

[03-Dec-18 11:24 AM] SHossain#0007
Thanks @blackjok3r . I was mainly asking about public pool 😃

[03-Dec-18 11:24 AM] SHossain#0007
@webworker01 said he will get sapling activated version released before the 15th dec

[03-Dec-18 07:46 PM] $tefano.#3560
Pool http://miningpools.cloud/  must add some GB of ram ..  150000 KMD paid it's a big db 😄
No impact to mining pool. please wait some minutes, thank you

[03-Dec-18 08:19 PM] SHossain#0007
here The first KMD public pool to be Sapling ready will get a 100 KMD bounty from me and 1000 KMD bounty from jl777.
Requirements: You need sapling specific pool code and release the source for community.
The komodod binaries need to be compiled from **FSM** branch of https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo repo specifically. and the chain param is 
```
./komodod -ac_name=SPLTEST -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &

@SHossain Is KMD Sapling the same as ZEC Sapling?

[03-Dec-18 08:22 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[03-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810

[03-Dec-18 08:23 PM] SHossain#0007
Woot Woot 😍

[03-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but the code needs to be open source

[03-Dec-18 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i added that in my post. adding your bounty amount too

[03-Dec-18 08:24 PM] plazma#1625
does verus have sapling pool

[03-Dec-18 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
@plazma yes. they have

[03-Dec-18 08:25 PM] plazma#1625
@SHossain cool i m mining right now verus at R address

[03-Dec-18 08:26 PM] plazma#1625
maybe i will try zs address

[03-Dec-18 08:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@Andrei [ᴬᴸᵀᴾᴼᴼᴸ.ᴾᴿᴼ]  and anyone else, use the following chain as test

**FSM** branch of PirateNetwork repo for the above chain

[03-Dec-18 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
the above chain has already sapling activated and works like KMD.

[03-Dec-18 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
so, would be a good test on SPLTEST chain

[03-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Andrei [ᴬᴸᵀᴾᴼᴼᴸ.ᴾᴿᴼ]#7795
@SHossain Can this node version be used on working pool?
