cool approach. so you can only mine when the last block is more than twice the target time behind so your fake node gets accepted

do huh?

"peermagic": 4406ad4c = c4da6044

[24-Jul-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, "reverse" them in pairs

[24-Jul-18 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[24-Jul-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
btw webworker mad this to do it for you:
```magic=$(echo $magic | sed 's/magic.//')
    magicrev=""
    for((i=0;i<=${#magic};i+=2)); do
        magicrev="${magic:i:2}$magicrev"
done```

4406ad4c = 44 06 ad 4c --> 4c ad 06 44 = 4cad0644

[24-Jul-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but james changed the output from the stdout of the deamon and it broke how the stuff passes into the script üò¶

[24-Jul-18 12:02 PM] HashUnlimited#9427
I am only repeating myself one more time. Listen to daddy coin dev. Do not use that, it‚Äôs deprecated since late 2014

[24-Jul-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well it was removed from the scaletest z-nomp config generator so I thaught it wasnt needed either

[24-Jul-18 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r did you kill your POSTEST64D node?

[24-Jul-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its runnig I think... or it should be

I just killed it... I need to wait for Alright... he will know what I have done wrong... I am guessing I need to make another VM, and install from clean.

[24-Jul-18 12:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
If you guys are still having issues, I was building that repo all day yesterday but I‚Äôve been using nvm v7.8.0

[24-Jul-18 12:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
A few other versions would give me issues.

[24-Jul-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôm planning on posting a link for a new public pool later today that will have KMD as well as SuperNET, REVS, DEX and probably the other SuperNET assets

[24-Jul-18 12:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I saw someone just updated their z-nomp a few days back, because your blocks are now mined as kmd-nomp in the Mined By section on https://explorer.komodo.services

[24-Jul-18 01:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I guess it was @blackjok3r maybe üòä

[24-Jul-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No

I am just trying to point one GPU at an AC that no body else is minign just to test something

[24-Jul-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I cant get anyhting to work

[24-Jul-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181

creating invalid blocks

[24-Jul-18 01:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Well if you think it‚Äôs my pool, try z-nomp. I was just about to say, for anyone interested it‚Äôs basically exactly the same. I just got rid of the other coin setups, and added ones for all the assetchains.

[24-Jul-18 01:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Core wise it should be identical, it‚Äôs at the same commit as z-nomp

[24-Jul-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what it is... I doubt its the pool too.

[24-Jul-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It has to be a miss config, as the komodod mines via CPU just fine

[24-Jul-18 01:05 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Hmm that‚Äôs strange. Did you have kmd-nomp working for any assetchains? Or is just that one the issue

[24-Jul-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And I am not using any of your configs btw... I treied to add RFOX...

[24-Jul-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I can test on my side if you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôm just about to start testing some assetchains on my public pool site

[24-Jul-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried RFOX and CRYPTO both gave same errors

[24-Jul-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Hmm okay. I‚Äôm going to try a few here in a minute

[24-Jul-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sweet let me know.. I think its something I did, becasuse I had heaps of issues to get it to even install...

[24-Jul-18 01:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Yea I would get tons of install issues originally as well. I‚Äôm not sure why v7.8.0 seemed to install flawlessly for me

[24-Jul-18 01:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
But I‚Äôm reusing that version on multiple servers hah

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôll add it to the readme install notes

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I think maybe I should create another VM... I guess to get a public facing port I can SSH tunnel to the public facing VM... damn not having my own NAT access lol.

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Ha a bit more tricky

[24-Jul-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah. I guess if I just used uBuntu 16.04 like everyone else it would all work easier lol

[24-Jul-18 01:10 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Well that‚Äôs what OS mine are running on ha

[24-Jul-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
k I will make a new VM using that, not like it takes long... I recently found out I can assign more resources than my server has and it just shares them... so its not really an issue. üòÑ

[24-Jul-18 01:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
hah thats pretty cool

[24-Jul-18 01:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm installing assetchains now on my pool server

[24-Jul-18 01:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
then we can do some private testing on assetchains before i make it public

[24-Jul-18 01:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
hopefully its goes fast. its not quite NN resources

[24-Jul-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
NN needs nothing but RAM

[24-Jul-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am always looking for other stuff I can do on my server to use it for something... 48 cores is such a waste sitting idle lol

[24-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r you're seeing that error on chains that are properly synced?

[24-Jul-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I am mining htem with CPU perfecty...

[24-Jul-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and notarizing from the same chain

[24-Jul-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not same deamon... but the notatixing node is connect= to this one

[24-Jul-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just made a new VM using ubuntu16.04 and node 7.8.0

[24-Jul-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yet to sync any chains and try mining though, but tbh I see the same errors in install here... which are warnings only in any case it seems

[24-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
I've never seen that error before, but google made it seem like you have corrupted chains

[24-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
which is strange because you don't

[24-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
can you pm your pool_configs file

[24-Jul-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sure

anyone into FPGA mining? they're apparently 10-30x faster than GPUs

[25-Jul-18 05:21 AM] Portypete#5024
bummer

[25-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Trystaero#7522
Asic*

[25-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Trystaero#7522
There I fixed it for you.

[25-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Trystaero#7522
Fpgas are not that much faster without expensive supporting hardware and would make them extremely price inefficient.

[25-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Trystaero#7522
Some algos they will be faster at but not a blanket statement as you suggested.

[25-Jul-18 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only "expense" to an FPGA is the same as to an ASIC -- board bandwidth and RAM

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] doo#1366
nope i really mean fpga, i think it's that much faster. i already tried in AWS it's 10x faster. and that's the unoptimized code

[25-Jul-18 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@doo you coded, compiled, and deployed an AWS FPGA for equihash?

[25-Jul-18 01:20 PM] doo#1366
not really, i follow some tutorial https://fpga.guide/4a-Howto-AWS/
and not for equihash

Those are the copy pasted steps I used to create a pool for RFOX, on a clean 16.04 VPS

[25-Jul-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am about to point some tiny amount of rented hash at it... 100sol and see if that works.

[25-Jul-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its still not working

[25-Jul-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same error as before

[25-Jul-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r more hash doesn't make invalid blocks more valid

[25-Jul-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... I am testing wether another rig fixes the issue

[25-Jul-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright said mine worked on his pool but I am not so sure

[25-Jul-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my 1st question would be: is your znomp picking up the correct coinbase reward amount?

[25-Jul-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea... how to I test that?

[25-Jul-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
after I finish my samich, I'll fire up a vm and a clean znomp fetch and see what I can see

[25-Jul-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks... I copy pasted exactly one by one each step and pasted it there.

[25-Jul-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont know what I missed.. but clearly something is wrong

[25-Jul-18 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it might not be something "you" missed, it might be that the flavor stratum you're using isn't getting the correct info to even start building the correct block

[25-Jul-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
after building it 3 times on 3 diffrent systems while others doing the exact same thing have a working pool... is kind of getting to me lol.

[25-Jul-18 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or, it could even be that the current dev branch is wonky

[25-Jul-18 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
have you tried with komodo master branch instead of dev?

[25-Jul-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no Alright told me not to... but I will do this while waiting for myt LTC to rental to send

[25-Jul-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there was a bug in dev, that I thought might be related that was fixed today, but james was right and its not related

[25-Jul-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The rented hash has the same issue.

[25-Jul-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So its definatly something with the pool. This is also on komodo master branch.

[25-Jul-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the issue is all of the centralized bullshit in the stratum core
