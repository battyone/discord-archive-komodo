I was pinged here. Yes, Core Scientific will be unveiling what we have worked on for the last year.

[16-Jul-19 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@OhGodAGirl that sounds cool, congrats

[16-Jul-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
@Lumbi you have a working build of komodod for raspi3?

[16-Jul-19 06:36 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Check http://janemercer.us/, @Alright

[16-Jul-19 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
so that's a yes?

[16-Jul-19 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
last time I heard from her it wasn't working on actual raspis, have a few sitting here doing nothing I'd play around with if it works

[16-Jul-19 06:41 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
It's all v8, so 64 bit... I believe the Raspi3 is 32 bit

[16-Jul-19 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 raspi is no bueno

[16-Jul-19 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
need a real machine to run those binaries 😉

[16-Jul-19 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
for deep reasons, rasppi doesn't have the correct ARM stuff, and it's just not a great piece of HW for the cost

[16-Jul-19 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
either get the same thing way cheaper without the marketing cost, or spend a few more bucks and get something way better

[16-Jul-19 06:59 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That's why I went for a clone with a RK3399 onboard

[16-Jul-19 07:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, they are much better, and have better ARM instructions and 64 bit support and performance

[16-Jul-19 07:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
like one of these: https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=234

[16-Jul-19 07:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
the new Pirate dedicated HW is based on something very similar to that, same RK3399, but some different board placements of USB/etc

[16-Jul-19 08:16 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I’m using the RockPi 4A, with NVMe expansion board to store blockchains. Should keep me going for a while (btw, running also KMD wallet on it...)

[16-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@NutellaLicka A multiple mobile wallet and exchange service. And we also have plans to build a tether for Naira on the Komodo platform.

[17-Jul-19 02:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r very interesting, welcome to the community. Is this the private or public sector that is funding this?

[17-Jul-19 09:58 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@dukeleto its private. Blockchain tech is kinda still a mystery in Nigeria. I'm most likely one of the few miners here in Nigeria.

[17-Jul-19 11:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r you are on the bleeding edge! Very nice to hear from you. Are there any cryptocoin exchanges based in your country currently or would you be building the first?

[17-Jul-19 11:18 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@dukeleto We don't have any indigenous exchange. There's Luno, they only offer BTC and ETH

[17-Jul-19 11:18 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
Luno is a multinational

[17-Jul-19 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r sounds like you have good timing to launch a proper exchange that is geared towards your country. Are the local laws favorable towards cryptocoins?

[17-Jul-19 11:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r also, to keep it a bit on topic, may I ask what kind of electricity rates people in your country would pay for mining? I haven't heard much statistics about Africa

[17-Jul-19 11:47 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
About laws. There isn't much regulation in the space right now. I guess the government is still trying to understand it all.  About electricity, its not so favourable on this front. There's no steady power supply, most times, we have to run our own generators. I'm lucky though, my mining facility has free electricity from a multinational my family leased land to. Lol. @dukeleto

[17-Jul-19 11:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
haha nice

[17-Jul-19 11:53 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@hyperDEX  yeah. I'm certain there aren't much miners in Nigeria because of the hassle and cost of running a farm

[17-Jul-19 11:54 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
I spend about $10 per month. That's cost for internet.

[17-Jul-19 11:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Wow that is pretty cool. Is solar an option for a more stable electricity?

[17-Jul-19 12:00 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
Nigeria is pretty hot. Solar is a solid option. That's for private individuals though. My country has really poor governance. Corruption.

[17-Jul-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The problem with solar is you would need to store it overnight too.

[17-Jul-19 12:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Batteries cost is crazy, unless you can capture that power it would be wasted effort. I saw a video once where during the day, solar panels excess power was used to pump water up to a dam. During the night, the water was released from the dam to generate hydro power and the cycle repeats.

[17-Jul-19 12:08 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@hyperDEX  that's really smart.

[17-Jul-19 12:18 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
I can't really imagine that happening in Nigeria now. According to our government, the problem really isn't power generation. Its more of a distribution problem. This generation of leaders seriously have no interest in solving the power issues.

[17-Jul-19 12:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That sucks, all politicians get into politics for money/power or fame. not to help its population.

[17-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
Sadly so.

[17-Jul-19 12:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They are all the same all over the world. Some parts are more up front about their corruption.

@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r with free electricity, you are in the right place. You can make a lot of money with low capital costs via Equihash mining

[17-Jul-19 06:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
How about Barterlly @Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r ?   You could get a white label product made to suit your needs.

[17-Jul-19 06:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then you are mobile ready from the start.

[17-Jul-19 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Talk to @Deleted User about the costs to do this.   You could launch as soon as parameters and art are completed I imagine.

[17-Jul-19 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085

@FishyGuts I'm not sure I understand the benefits and features of Barterlly. I thought its only a DEX

[17-Jul-19 10:23 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
Can anyone please explain?

[18-Jul-19 11:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r sounds awesome. Make sure that you note, Z11's only do 220v, not 120v

[18-Jul-19 08:20 PM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@dukeleto the normal voltage here is 220v.

[18-Jul-19 11:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r that works out really good for mining! It's more efficient and generates less heat too

[18-Jul-19 11:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
My next farm upgrade is to install 2 x 20amp 220v breakers, I am maxing out my  120v breakers

Let's hope he comes through.

@FishyGuts  don’t hold out on me bro lol

[19-Jul-19 12:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and ComputerGenie lowball price`
would be less than half of:
`Have someone sniffing at 2750 each`

[19-Jul-19 12:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless it's 2750 WLC, in which case I would price match

[19-Jul-19 01:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Offering more than highest 🤷‍♂️

[19-Jul-19 08:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085

for the list

[22-Jul-19 12:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
as per code there is no max supply
