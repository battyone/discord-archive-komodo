I want to make it easy for pool ops, I know it's not easy to maintain pools

[16-Mar-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It depends what coinbase your going to use.. .just founders reward, I think its ok to use your fix, but anyhting more complicated, the pool simply cant take its fee from the coinbase reliably.

[16-Mar-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My ZEX pool hasnt been restarted since we activated sapling 😂

[16-Mar-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Litterly done no work to it at all ... I just check its still paying out every now and then

[16-Mar-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Trick is to just not use any JS if you can avoid it ... I wanted to offload more stuff to the deamon, but wasnt able to work that out

[16-Mar-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
screw the "stratum protocol" :troll:

[16-Mar-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`screw the "stratum protocol"`
The only way to do that is to put calls back into the daemon

[16-Mar-19 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was reffering to the part where it takes the fee from the coinbase ... the rest of it is kind of required

[16-Mar-19 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto There's no real way to "drop in" to s/z/k/nomp that allows pool fees (that's always been the inherent issue) without adding to the daemon template

[16-Mar-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Using just the founders rweard and burning fees, you can usea normal pool... provided it can build the right signatures

[16-Mar-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the value check is a pita :troll:

[16-Mar-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... really not work scrwing with IMO

[16-Mar-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`burning fees`
*should never be a thing*

[16-Mar-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I like using the daemon coinbase directly 😃

[16-Mar-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_says "fek it" and just starts over with_ `git init`

[16-Mar-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[16-Mar-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, one of the major issues is that most folks don't really understand where "stratum" ends and "a pool" begins, so it's all just a jumbled mess that needs to be redone from the ground up with no care or concept of the notion of "backwards compatibility" with s/z/k/nomp
And as I read that it makes me cringe that there are an ever growing number of letters to / as well as giving me a sense of deja vu

[16-Mar-19 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah. Something simpler would be good, not using nodejs.... but like... what else is easy enough to make it with?

[16-Mar-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the problem with making it *not* js is that it requires learning notjs 😕

[16-Mar-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha true that ...

[16-Mar-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
glad its not something I need to fix :troll:

[16-Mar-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[16-Mar-19 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_starts looking for reasons to make @blackjok3r code something for it_

[16-Mar-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol Can we use a CC contract to make a pool 🤣

[16-Mar-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that option has crossed my mind (especially with the idea of fungible migrations)

[16-Mar-19 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've though up 1000 ways to make it more complex 😛

[16-Mar-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Soon we should have the possibility to cross chain `non-fungible tokens`

[16-Mar-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
an onchain pool would be cool...

[16-Mar-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I think it would be horribly inefficiant

[16-Mar-19 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, in trying to perfect payments on pirate solo, I've been toying with both the idea of polling back in daemon as well as just going back to slush's original py stratum and starting over

[16-Mar-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When I started with the knomp coinbase thing .. my idea was to offload basically everything (includeing verify hashes) back to the daemon

[16-Mar-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that way a pool would work with litterally every algo

[16-Mar-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would be standard ... and "just work" with every Assetchain any one could ever invent

[16-Mar-19 03:04 PM] newvulcan#9571
I've implemented that change to mining.cpp, so I'll see what happens. Currently s-nomp is giving a "Error, founders reward missing for block template!" every now and then - not an error or warning just appears to be a statement of fact.

[16-Mar-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to use a speical pool for ZEX

hasnt been restarted in 3 months or something ... still works 😃

[16-Mar-19 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, we've really reached that point
initially my whole "we need an us thing" was mostly a "fuk ZEC/ZEN" thing, but we're honestly at the point where I think the level of "if"s in the trees is feken insane and the more we continue the worse it gets (including as you've pointed out several times that there are situations that the current libs *cannot* handle)

[16-Mar-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... exactly... My pool gets half way there... as long as everything uses equihash ...

[16-Mar-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With some way to verify the PoW with an RPC to the daemon ... It would be totally a standard that would litterally work with everything

[16-Mar-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dear god, I'm agreeing that we need to do things joker's way, the end is neigh 😲

{Reactions}
😂 

[16-Mar-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As the equihash verify code in the nomp ... is just a copy paste of the code in the daemon.. does hte same thing

[16-Mar-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just couldnt figure out how to connect them together at the time ... maybe I could do it now

[16-Mar-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, eq verify is more about share counts and "fairness" in payments than anything else

[16-Mar-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... .which is why I couldnt work it out ...

[16-Mar-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught it was just veriifying a found block...

[16-Mar-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its not... That would be something I need help with, as Im not sure how it works or what exactly it does

[16-Mar-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the short answer is that it verifies that a share is a legitimate solution 
if yes, then share counts
if no, then miner gets no credit for the share

[16-Mar-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
deep in the math there are shares that are "valid" but not legitimate 😕

[16-Mar-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so without it a "miner" could just send "fake" shares and get credit over and over

[16-Mar-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I see my pool sometimes rejects shares from it, not sure if thats a miner problem though... my guess is that its a miner submiting an invliad share

[16-Mar-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So basically the RPC has to do equihashverify on a share?

[16-Mar-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just return true or false?

[16-Mar-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as there wasnt too many flooding... it would be ok... but daemon RPC gets overloaded easily

[16-Mar-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also needs a way to choose what hash algo to verify ... wihout just moving all the complexity to the daemon side

[16-Mar-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I think flooding was the reason they offset it to it's own executable, because the larger the pool the more demand that would put on the daemon

[16-Mar-19 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Also needs a way to choose what hash algo to verify ...`
that should be roughly "easy", the base is there already to support K,N and "networks", so in theory it would be just adding the new modules (obviously more in work than words, but in principle it should work)

[16-Mar-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, time to head up the hill and pretend that I want to be outside doing manual labor ☹

[16-Mar-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Mar-19 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i agree with both of you, clean all current mining pool software with fire, and design something from the ground up

[16-Mar-19 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Whoever is trying to mine KMD at chickenpool.com with address `RWdQye1bgJiwKcAFKgtX6fGure8JwDmVKN`, please let me know what miner you're using
`mining.suggest_target` is supported by almost no pool on the planet and your miner isn't connecting because of it; perhaps we can get together and find a work-around

[16-Mar-19 09:22 PM] vulcan#5394
@blackjok3r @dukeleto I've redone my knomp install and even rebooted so I've got a clean startup. No errors now, but no blocks found either. Beginning to think my copy of the blockchain might be corrupt. Is that a possibility, if so whats the best way to resync/reindex it ?

[16-Mar-19 09:23 PM] vulcan#5394
Btw Im hitting this server with 200kh/s, so i should be finding at least 1 block per hour of ZEX

[16-Mar-19 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that you haven't found a block does not mean there is an issue
your "expected" is an "on average" basis and only comes true over a long term
there are times where chickenpool has went 10+ hrs without finding a KMD block with double the hashrate as it had when it was finding 1 every 1-1.5 hrs
bad luck factually happens (I recall slush hitting a BTC block last year at like 2000x expected)

[16-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
@vulcan why do you have 5 accounts in this discord

[16-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
Also, did you try the thing I recommend in #kmdlabs

[16-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
you *need* that

[16-Mar-19 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`bad luck factually happens` \* unless you run kano pool, in which case you just blame S9 firmware for your bad luck :troll:

[16-Mar-19 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
well you don't need it, but if you don't use it, you'll have to code the implementation yourself

[16-Mar-19 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright they told him the same thing in here too

[16-Mar-19 09:33 PM] vulcan#5394
@Alright I think i have tried that, can't swear to it, but i will check. As for these 5 accounts, the only one that i should be using is newvulcan, so not sure why the other 4 exist. I'll check and remove them.

[16-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
can you show me what you have in `knomp/coins/ZEX.json`

[16-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
or whatever you named it

[16-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
did you start the daemon with `-pubkey`?

[16-Mar-19 09:37 PM] vulcan#5394
My komodod command line had -ac_pubkey= if thats the same thing. I'll post my json file in a sec

[16-Mar-19 09:37 PM] Alright#0419
it's not the same

[16-Mar-19 09:37 PM] Alright#0419
do `komodo-cli -ac_name=ZEX validateaddress $(komodo-cli -ac_name=ZEX getnewaddress)`

[16-Mar-19 09:38 PM] Alright#0419
take the `"pubkey"` from that and start the daemon with `-pubkey=<pubkey>`

[16-Mar-19 09:38 PM] Alright#0419
do not change ac_pubkey, you must leave that

[16-Mar-19 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
then in the `knomp/pool_configs/ZEX.json` file you must set the addresses to the address the pubkey is for

[16-Mar-19 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
the one shown in validateaddress output

[16-Mar-19 09:40 PM] Alright#0419
you need `"disablecb":  "true"` in the `knomp/coins/ZEX.json` as well

[16-Mar-19 10:50 PM] newvulcan#9571
@Alright - Thanks, sorted all those and restarted everything. Think I'll leave it running overnight and see what gives in the morning. Here is my zex.json file.
{
"name": "ZEX",
"symbol": "ZEX",
"algorithm": "equihash",
"txfee": 0.0001,
"disablecb":true
}

and my start line for komodod

./komodod -ac_founders=1 -addnode=5.9.102.210 -ac_name=ZEX -ac_reward=13000000000 -ac_pubkey=<given from asset command> -ac_cc=2 -ac_halving=525600 -pubkey=<key from validateaddress>

[16-Mar-19 10:51 PM] Alright#0419
@newvulcan @newvulcan @newvulcan @newvulcan @vulcan 
what do you mean by this ` -ac_pubkey=<given from asset command>`

[16-Mar-19 10:53 PM] Alright#0419
it must be this exactly `-ac_pubkey=039d4a50cc70d1184e462a22edb3b66385da97cc8059196f8305c184a3e21440af`

[16-Mar-19 10:53 PM] Alright#0419
can you show me the output of nomp when you started it? Should have some info as to whether or not it's working

[16-Mar-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
want me to give these other accounts the boot btw?

[16-Mar-19 10:58 PM] newvulcan#9571
@Alright - Yes thats the ac_pubkey I used. As for the nomp output -

I think this probably has a very quick answer. Can you run multiple instances of node. That's to say, can I run knomp and snomp simultaneously ? I've got KMD, ARRR and ZEX running successfully on knomp, and ZCL and HUSH running successfully on snomp. At the moment when I try, the second instance of npm I try and run fails.
