`The maximum purchase amount per day is 10.000‚Ç¨.`
Now, if only I knew how much 1‚Ç¨ was, much less 10 thousand

[05-Jul-18 06:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Wow 10k that's pretty nice.

[05-Jul-18 07:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
however....

[05-Jul-18 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`If you didn‚Äôt register or verifiy yourself, you can make just one card load of up to 250‚Ç¨.`
so you comply with KYC bullshit or it's only ever good for 250 euros

I wish ya'll feks would stop dumping KMD on the open market and let the price rise, I'm tired of dual switch mining KMD and ZCL üò°

isn't BarterDEX open market as well? is there any secret netid with almighty bobs?

[06-Jul-18 04:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
There's been at least a few trades on "private" (unannounced) netids

[06-Jul-18 05:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
It took me 7 hrs to sell the KMD I needed to sell off to pay for miners in order to not drop the price
10k sold and the price was higher when I was done than when I started üòé

[06-Jul-18 06:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, exchanges are; cmc just scrapes the info

[06-Jul-18 06:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ce.io shows `24h Volume     0.51579871` which translates to the `$3,355` that cmc has

[06-Jul-18 06:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
works out to an average trade of ~$38

[06-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

To be fair, when we decided to aim for a million, it was mostly because there was no need for it, it shows that whatever need might arise, we can do it.

Whatever happend with NXT? Is that abandoned? Is Ardor the main coin now?

[07-Jul-18 10:28 AM] sœÜldat#8733
Ardor is Nxt 2.0 , with Ignis the first child-chain with all features.
But Nxt isn't abandoned for another 3/2 years.

[07-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah thought nxt was abandoned

[07-Jul-18 11:56 AM] Hegelian#0018
So ignis is like an ardor asset-chain?

[07-Jul-18 11:56 AM] Hegelian#0018
So ardor is the main coin, but why was ignis an airdrop for nxt and not ardr?

[07-Jul-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
IGNIS was one of the largest ICO

[07-Jul-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
half to NXT, half sold in ICO auction paid in NXT

[07-Jul-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
ARDR cant really be used as a currency due to very high txfee

[07-Jul-18 12:05 PM] Hegelian#0018
That's good to know, I liked nxt back in 2014 but haven't followed what's happened to it
