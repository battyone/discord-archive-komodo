[04-Jun-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Tek diet, exercise, and proper breathing techniques are not "sheer willpower"

[04-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[04-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Tek#5253
yes they are

[04-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Tek#5253
you clearly never have had to use sheer willpower

[04-Jun-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[04-Jun-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
