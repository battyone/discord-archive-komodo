10k sats is really bad, whatever you are gonna say, its bad

[26-Jun-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if you self half, each time it doubles, you do fine

[26-Jun-19 01:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
buy sell is not just a work of day traders, long term traders also does that.

[26-Jun-19 01:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Yup, if I trade with a profit, I am going to be in a profit

[26-Jun-19 01:38 PM] Caglio#3337
I totally understand that point of view

[26-Jun-19 01:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
tfw 100% alts :troll_lol:

[26-Jun-19 01:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for a person who bought at 20k sat, obviously 10k sat is bad, ONLY if they sell it on 10k sat, like if they really need them right at this moment.
If they don't need them, and they don't sell, and keep them until the price rises back, how come this 10k sat better than just giving them useless panic??

[26-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Dude I am holding till it fell from 45k üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Caglio#3337
thats all what I am saying

[26-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Im keep holding until we sink at 5k sats

[26-Jun-19 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
still the same lines apply, change the txt from 20k to 45k

[26-Jun-19 01:39 PM] ronyi#5719
I holding many KMD, but if KMD hit 6k sat i buy more.  Just holding and claim rewards. KMD is awsome. I don't care the price, i'm investor not a daytrader. Yes, i have time to wait. Everyone wants to get rich fast and yes i bought KMD 30k sat in 2017 still holding...

[26-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but, it aint gonna happen ( :

[26-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Caglio#3337
And that 5% is great

[26-Jun-19 01:40 PM] p.#1126
Lol hold since 45k

[26-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Caglio#3337
when you lost 65%

[26-Jun-19 01:40 PM] p.#1126
Dude

[26-Jun-19 01:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Most of you got no clue how important today is. 

Today marks the first day of the march towards extinction for most of you and you dont even know it.

[26-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Caglio#3337
Even more at 1k sats

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] p.#1126
That guy is insane fwiw

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Caglio#3337
But we can always hope btc hits a million

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Caglio#3337
then we might be good ( :

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] p.#1126
20k sats at 20k btc is better no?

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] p.#1126
Helllooooo

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Caglio#3337
If we hit 20k btc now

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Is it good ?

[26-Jun-19 01:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you are confident with you analysis of it gonna go down further, and won't come back where you wish it to be, accept your losses and don't go into more losses.

[26-Jun-19 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
get something whatever you can get back and put them into something which you think can go up in value

[26-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder so your advice for me is to buy cocaine ?

[26-Jun-19 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
again, not talking about KMD specifically, but general cryptocurrency, any asset class

[26-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh as in cryptocurrency ( :

[26-Jun-19 01:42 PM] coingirl87#6489
@caglio we are in competition?

[26-Jun-19 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
did I say something specific about what to buy or not to buy?

[26-Jun-19 01:42 PM] coingirl87#6489
I am the one which complains

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not complaining

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Its just, everyone jerked off few days ago

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337

:abusedsmily:

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
now when we sinked 12k its all ok

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
yeah, its not

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
but good job for "holders" and "investors"

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
2k profit, into -10k deficit

[26-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Yaaay

[26-Jun-19 01:44 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder and you are right in all ur points, I agree

[26-Jun-19 01:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
üôÇ üëç

[26-Jun-19 01:44 PM] Caglio#3337
But I am just stating the facts, that we are going downwards all the time, trading is the key and all, but as a holder... its a shit show and hurtful to watch

[26-Jun-19 01:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I never say anyone to buy KMD. I'm mostly just a tech guy praising KMD's tech.

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz I love its tech advancements

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and its philosophy

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Caglio#3337
And if it was a real life, and not a crypto, we would prolly already all be rich

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
üòÑ corrected

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] coingirl87#6489
We are in the same boat...loosing is not fine...thats why i am complainig every day although i know that kmd is great project with great devs

[26-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Caglio#3337

1W $KMD breaking from 1400 support and looking for a new place to bounce at ATL. Like many other ATL alts, nothing confirming as support yet. Needs a good 60% bounce up to look attractive.
