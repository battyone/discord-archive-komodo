And what happens when gold reached $10k p/oz and 4 million tons of fukgoldonium are discovered just under the Indian Ocean floor?

[07-Mar-19 03:49 PM] blubbi#0643
thers only a cube of 20m in total as gold on earth

[07-Mar-19 03:50 PM] blubbi#0643
as long as ur not an alchemist as in the 1800s who can make gold out of plumbum

[07-Mar-19 03:50 PM] blubbi#0643
thats it

[07-Mar-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
245 thousand tons goes a long feken way in electronics, and even further with your concept of smaller and smaller (which actually makes it less and less needed by volume)

[07-Mar-19 03:53 PM] blubbi#0643
u dont get it

[07-Mar-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I don't get the emotional attachment to the 1800s

[07-Mar-19 03:54 PM] blubbi#0643
catched up ur 1800s statement

[07-Mar-19 03:56 PM] blubbi#0643
if electronics get smaler more parts had to be out ot gold

[07-Mar-19 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
let's ignore the entire concept of fukgoldonium ever being discovered, what happens to your investment value when AGW unveils a previously frozen cavern system containing veins in excess of 3 million tons?

[07-Mar-19 03:58 PM] blubbi#0643
ouh man

[07-Mar-19 03:58 PM] blubbi#0643
im not talking about investment

[07-Mar-19 03:58 PM] blubbi#0643
talked about undervalued about future utillity

[07-Mar-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`im not talking about investment`
value is all about investment

[07-Mar-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on pure utility, there isn't enough planet to hold all of the devices that would use up a 22m cube

[07-Mar-19 04:06 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Elon Musk might mine some more gold from asteroid probably in the future 😄

[07-Mar-19 04:06 PM] blubbi#0643
u know that less than half of world population got acess to internet

[07-Mar-19 04:07 PM] blubbi#0643
thats the only way the price would sink dramatically, but theres some fekking more worth metals to mine on asteroids as gold

[07-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, of course Elon will mine all those as well probably

[07-Mar-19 04:10 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Also there might be a chance that technology improvement might make gold usage obsolete

[07-Mar-19 04:11 PM] blubbi#0643
nope

[07-Mar-19 04:12 PM] Wazzup#0510
Is there any meaning at all then  lol ? I bet tech improvement will allow us to upload to the cloud and live forever

[07-Mar-19 04:12 PM] blubbi#0643
as i said thers no better metal with electrical conductivity, specific thermal conductivity as gold

[07-Mar-19 04:12 PM] Wazzup#0510
Everything is a bad investement

[07-Mar-19 04:12 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The point is we can only speculate to the future, unless you can time travel 🚍

[07-Mar-19 04:12 PM] Wazzup#0510
we are all gonna die

[07-Mar-19 04:14 PM] Wazzup#0510
What if Bitcoin becomes inflationary

[07-Mar-19 04:14 PM] Wazzup#0510
hmmm ?

[07-Mar-19 04:14 PM] Wazzup#0510
Have you ever thought about that?

[07-Mar-19 04:14 PM] Wazzup#0510
lol

Bitcoin users in Canada are being targeted with audits by the Canada Revenue Agency (federal tax agency). Attached are some images of the questionnaire being sent out to individuals in relation to the audits.

No, but I thought about What if A big Asteroid is heading to earth and decimating the whole population lol

[07-Mar-19 04:16 PM] blubbi#0643
if we develop Bor, Nitrogen dotated Graphen structures in pure quality could made gold in electronic devices obsolent

[07-Mar-19 04:18 PM] blubbi#0643
they might got better electrical conductivity, specific thermal conductivity as gold but were 20-30 years away of that

again

[07-Mar-19 04:40 PM] blubbi#0643
think further

[07-Mar-19 04:41 PM] blubbi#0643
were living in an oxygen enviromental silver and copper get oxidize

[07-Mar-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true story: circuitry has never and can never be coated

[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] blubbi#0643
with gold?

[07-Mar-19 04:43 PM] blubbi#0643
thats how we do it in the moment

[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`with gold?
thats how we do it in the moment`
You realize that admitting that invalidates your own argument, right?

[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] blubbi#0643
no

[07-Mar-19 04:44 PM] blubbi#0643
u dont get it

[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] blubbi#0643
why we coated thinks with gold?

[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] blubbi#0643
cous of the properties of gold

[07-Mar-19 04:45 PM] blubbi#0643
if we go the way to make thinks smaller we got to leave some parts

[07-Mar-19 04:46 PM] blubbi#0643
and this isnt gold

[07-Mar-19 04:48 PM] Acura#2748
Anybody have look at the question from the Tweet ? 💩

[07-Mar-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the Tweet`

[07-Mar-19 04:53 PM] blubbi#0643
its more like we got to coat more parts if we go smaller

[07-Mar-19 04:56 PM] Acura#2748
The Tweet about the Canada Revenue Agency ...

[07-Mar-19 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_sees a statement and not a question_

[07-Mar-19 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, it links to a questionnaire

[07-Mar-19 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Acura I'm not sure how it really surprises anyone

[07-Mar-19 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99% of the work cops do is actually people telling on themselves

[07-Mar-19 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
If gold didn’t have value central banks wouldn’t be hoarding it. Gold wouldn’t have been stolen from the Ukraine during the coup, Venezuela’s gold wouldn’t be contested, Libya’s gold wouldn’t have been jacked... gold has always had value—for thousands of years.  It is unique on the periodic table. To say it has no value or will soon have little value is wildly bold and not an argument that is backed by much.

[07-Mar-19 05:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
When the global fiat Ponzi scheme implodes, gold and silver are very likely to “moon” in crypto terms

[07-Mar-19 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If gold didn’t have value central banks wouldn’t be hoarding it.`
That's precisely what gives it "value" (despite what @Wazzup thinks, value and scarcity are linked)

[07-Mar-19 05:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
It is one of many things that give it value

[07-Mar-19 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true, not the sole measure of value, but the bulk of it

[07-Mar-19 05:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
I don’t know that I agree with that at all

[07-Mar-19 05:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Hard to say what portion of its value is influenced by central banks attributing value to it

[07-Mar-19 05:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
But gold had lots of value prior to the existence of central banks

[07-Mar-19 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ask De Beers what they think 😉

[07-Mar-19 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
So that implies that central banks are not creating the value thru perception. It existed prior to their existence.

[07-Mar-19 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
Diamonds are an entirely different thing

[07-Mar-19 05:08 PM] blubbi#0643
the historical value comes from the shine, as the only metal which didnt oxidize and is to find solid in natur

[07-Mar-19 05:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
Sure, shine, non-oxidation, scarcity, inability to fake it effectively

[07-Mar-19 05:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
Fiat’s lifespan is so short in comparison.

[07-Mar-19 05:10 PM] blubbi#0643
it hasnt any value to native americans

[07-Mar-19 05:10 PM] blubbi#0643
it was called Tears of Sun

[07-Mar-19 05:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
So a Native American couldn’t have sold gold for something of value?

[07-Mar-19 05:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
Of course it had value.  Maybe not in their culture. But I would remind you that the Aztecs and Mayans and Incans were native Americans.

[07-Mar-19 05:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
And they valued the hell out of it

[07-Mar-19 05:11 PM] blubbi#0643
no they didnt

[07-Mar-19 05:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
Aztecs didn’t value gold?

[07-Mar-19 05:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
Incans didn’t value gold?

[07-Mar-19 05:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
The latter used a large quantity of gold jewelry, bullion and pottery to attempt to buy the freedom of their ruler

[07-Mar-19 05:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
They had a lot of it per capita. So perhaps it’s value was deflated in their isolated cultures. But they still valued it

[07-Mar-19 05:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
And right now, if you offered gold to any Native American, they would happily accept it.

[07-Mar-19 05:24 PM] blubbi#0643
not a value like westrn ppl gave it, they used it as a soft metal to easy edit it into art

[07-Mar-19 05:24 PM] blubbi#0643
they didnt build up their economics around gold, they didnt used gold coins or

[07-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Vertigo#0439
Right now there is less silver than gold above ground.

[07-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Vertigo#0439
Silver is used the most of the precious metals.

[07-Mar-19 05:32 PM] Vertigo#0439
Freaking Spanish auto correct keeps changing things

[07-Mar-19 06:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
I do like silver. Lead is nice too. Intrinsic value.

[07-Mar-19 06:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
lead demand is every bit as incessant as any precious metal.

[07-Mar-19 06:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah, lots of lead gets used up.  Hard to recycle/reuse slugs.

[07-Mar-19 07:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
