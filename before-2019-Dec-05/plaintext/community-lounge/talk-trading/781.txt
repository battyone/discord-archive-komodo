Wait no, doesnt it not reduce inflation?

[19-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because more people, less crypto per person

[19-Jun-19 09:52 PM] BanHammer#8115
Yes, but if I get kids, I'll be paying for them the first 20 years and if I get a daughter that gets fucked by Tek, then she'll probably end up not working and using my KMD's for many more years. So sorry, no kids, no moon

@GDAX Ok, sorry to spoil the party, but I need to reign in the excitement a bit...

Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, ...

@Tek how did you end up with kmd

[19-Jun-19 10:00 PM] Bittersweet#9376
you don't seem like a cryptoidealist

[19-Jun-19 10:01 PM] Tek#5253
dunno kmd seems like a coin that will make it. I am looking for older projects with some track record

[19-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Tek#5253
usually if it survives for a few years and stays in the top 100 it has a bigger chance to survive longer and not die out like 90% of shitcoins

[19-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Tek#5253
kmd had age and kmd promised tech

[19-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Tek#5253
so I bought in

[19-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Bittersweet#9376

yeah obviously

[19-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But definitely plan to grow to a lot more coins, as well as STO and vc investments

[19-Jun-19 10:09 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But yes at the moment we are focusing on kmd coins

[19-Jun-19 10:09 PM] Keppie#5156
