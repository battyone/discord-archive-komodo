now a nice drop with lots of blood would be good for final capitulation

vbk shows there are still too many dumb cunts in this crypto space

[04-Apr-19 01:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Sweep the Low (@ibuycheapcoins)

@SmartContracter My concern is the 50 week moving average. It has been major resistance the whole bear market and one last rejection led to the spring from the last bear market. It would take us to range lows.

[04-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
its funny how so many ppl rly think this is a start of a bullrun

[04-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
it was manipulated

[04-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
it was going to get rejected by 4.2k resistance but 100 mil order pumped it

[04-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Markus#5464
volume was getting lower and lower

[04-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Markus#5464
probably the guy who bought btc for 100 mil also did a 100x long on bitmex with a big stack

[04-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah short squeeze for real... 500mil in liquidations...

[04-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont think we will go sub 1k, but retest of 3.3 seems plausible

[04-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Markus#5464
if he did 100x he did 20000% only from 20% increasse

does that affect kmd's dpow if notarizations dont get confirmed in time?

[04-Apr-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
only on the secondary level, on the main level NNs still produce the equivalent of live checkpoints on the KMD chain itself

[04-Apr-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it is designed to handle this

[04-Apr-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
of course it is better if it was confirmed but tx in mempool is still findable by bitcoind

[04-Apr-19 02:55 PM] Markus#5464

When someone posts that $KMD is a centralized shitcoin but ignores the fact that anyone can launch any chain under KMD with no authorization or payment to KMD needed, electoral processes, community dev growth and more, there are two ingredients needed for this IMO, apathy ...

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
lol the guys in the chat are wondering why bittrex doesnt pump the price like binance does

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and 'bittrex doesnt have marketmakers'

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm not really sure how they think an exchange works... I think 3rd party people normally should be marketmakers, not the exchanges...

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As that is how you get fake volume etc etc

[05-Apr-19 08:08 AM] Keppie#5156
honestly would not be suprised if binance paid whales at one point to create fake volume tho

[05-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or that the project itself did so

[05-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean they raised a shitload of btc

[05-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Should have used portion of it to pump their own coin, get the fomo crowd in and THEN dump the premine on their sorry asses

[05-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
like a normal scam project would do

[05-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The fact that they didnt, might actually be a clue that they arent scamming, just not very smart at launching

What was IEO price for VBK?

Nvm, 10 cents

I didnt like when trex supported VBK ico so much, felt strange, and from discussion here I see it's most probably a nicely done well paid scam

[05-Apr-19 09:22 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
such things will never be over, only question why trex risk reputation so cheaply

[05-Apr-19 09:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think one of the trex owner / founder is also on the team / advisor of vbk
