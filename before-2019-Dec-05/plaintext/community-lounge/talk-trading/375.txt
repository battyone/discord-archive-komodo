Does anyone know what‚Äôs going on with Komodo? Shapeshift‚Äôs option is down allcoins faucet withdrawal‚Äôs are down crex24‚Äôs wallet is down and bittrex‚Äôs wallet is down did they get DDOS‚Äôed?

[14-Jan-19 08:38 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
But it‚Äôs up and running on coinexchange

[14-Jan-19 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We had to do a update. Some exchanges are still working on it

[14-Jan-19 08:41 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Ok how big was the update I started noticing it Saturday on allcoins faucet until today when i noticed the rest of the exchanges

[14-Jan-19 08:41 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
@siu - Chainmakers

[14-Jan-19 08:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not big, we just had to kill a bug that flourished from the sapling upgrade. It was a bug that required immediate action so the team moved forward to squash it fast. But since everyone had just updated to sapling not long ago, they had to do it again and well, its been harsh.

[14-Jan-19 08:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But anyway. The bug got fixed, all important parts of the network upgraded already and are still waoting for some particular exchanges to finish

[14-Jan-19 08:47 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Oh ok when these stuff happens on big exchanges how long is a typical wait time till it‚Äôs back up and running @siu - Chainmakers

[14-Jan-19 08:50 PM] SHossain#0007
Shapeshift will be back soon. They are working on it

[14-Jan-19 08:52 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
What about allcoins.pw that‚Äôs where most of my coins are since when shapeshift has been having problems lately being down a lot

[14-Jan-19 08:52 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
@SHossain

[14-Jan-19 08:53 PM] SHossain#0007
is altcoins.pw an exchange?

[14-Jan-19 08:54 PM] SHossain#0007
did you check if they are working fine or not?

[14-Jan-19 08:56 PM] SHossain#0007
if altcoins.pw is not working, please get in touch with the site operator to update komodo daemon if they are using native daemon to run their faucet service

[14-Jan-19 08:59 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
@SHossain it‚Äôs both it‚Äôs the process of shapeshift but the twist is that it functions as that and also a faucet with a built in wallet so I can rack up KMD and when ready I can withdraw it

[14-Jan-19 09:01 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Checked it but my end still says pending but they said that‚Äôs under maintence did not say if they are updating daemon or not @SHossain

[14-Jan-19 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
if altcoins.pw uses shapeshift's service, then you need to wait for shapeshift to finish the update

[14-Jan-19 09:03 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Ok figuring that they are working on it because they disabled the withdraw option so I‚Äôll probably wait i was just wondering if the whole network got DDOS‚Äôed or not

[14-Jan-19 09:03 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
@SHossain

[14-Jan-19 09:05 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
But at least I can do the rest on it like claims mining exchanging etc so it‚Äôs not a big time waister

This "news" has been lingering for days and is not true. Russia is exchanging some of its $ reserves to euro and yen not to bitcoin

[15-Jan-19 04:16 AM] cipi#4502
the more important news for me was "Russia is dumping US Treasury bonds"... i hope that is true and i hope China will do the same

[15-Jan-19 04:18 AM] bishop#9773
It is true... they report treasury holdings quarterly iirc

[15-Jan-19 04:20 AM] cipi#4502
yes, thought the same... this things must be reported/recorded somewhere

It's nice to get a chance to average down, but one gets to the point where you're ready for the price to move the other way.

it's funny how fast the market react the bad news  (well, not necessarily bad)

[15-Jan-19 09:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
even if not something to worry about, that is they just delay a little

[15-Jan-19 09:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
less than from 48 from the planned upgrade is a little cliffhanger, but good they catch it
