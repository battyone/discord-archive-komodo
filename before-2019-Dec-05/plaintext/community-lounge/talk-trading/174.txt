Break even (BE) back in 2014/15 was support, we were at bottom of BE this year with sporadic upward movements.

[26-Sep-18 11:49 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
around 6k

[26-Sep-18 11:49 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
New  current and upcoming BE seems to be 7300

[26-Sep-18 11:49 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
on avarage we are likely to end up around 36k mean BTC price end of 2019 wit rising BE

[26-Sep-18 11:50 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
upper standard deviation of 3.2 is 42k, lower spectrum of 1.8 is around ~24k

[26-Sep-18 11:51 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I believe it will keep going sideways for sometime, not all indicators are reset yet

[26-Sep-18 11:51 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
maybe a rally up to 11k and then down again.

[26-Sep-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BE for miners on 1 brand specific piece of equipment as "base" price is among the silliest of ideas I've ever heard

[26-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Some miners have lower electric cost than others as well, so each miner's BE price is situation specific

[26-Sep-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆 secondary to that 1 piece of equipment being arbitrary

[26-Sep-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
By that logic, RAM shortage should have sent ZEC price to the moon in March

[26-Sep-18 11:56 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Yeah, it's not perfect, but there is BE pint for everybody, even if it's lower. And most Bitcoins get mined by specified miners, they got big halls and need to pay electricity monthly, running cost, otherwise they are forced to shut off their machines and stop mining, killing the supply.

[26-Sep-18 11:57 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I imagine it can go as low as 5k, was also last resistance. in 2015 we went down to last resistence + the BE price. This created the support floor and went up from there to 20k

[26-Sep-18 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`otherwise they are forced to shut off their machines and stop mining, killing the supply.`
There's so many holes in that idea that I'm going to have to take my bath and reflect on which I should address 1st 🙄

less hash does not ever equal less supply in any meaningful way longer than *x* blocks 
Even if the hashrate dropped to 10% of what it is, the diff would adjust and life would go on

It's just divided over less miners when some shut down because it's not profitable for them to mine anymore

[26-Sep-18 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Well, for BTC, that's not entirely true, because of the length of diff change

[26-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I knew you were going to say that, hence the give or take 😄

[26-Sep-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wsa going to say if it fell to 10% of what it is now.... it would take a LONG time to send some BTC for a while LOL.

they are the "worlds best software devs" there is absolutely zero chance of any bugs in segwit, even it if is the most convoluted, complex and massive change ever made to bitcoin

please ignore that for 2 years until a BCH dev found the bug that BTC could have been doublespent at anytime by any miner

[26-Sep-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
actually the vins could have been used multiple times to create new coins, so technically not a double spend

[26-Sep-18 12:13 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 killing was the wrong word to use. But as a miner if I am below BE thinking from a business perspective I would shut off mining to minimize running costs, but also sell as little coins as possible, simply survice until BTC prices are up again to sell at better profit margins. maybe not right out killing the supply, but reducing it. sell coins only if needed. Also the shift in hash should allow more "non business" miners to get a bugger shared of generated coins. I am assuming here, but as a private miner with a home setup you are more likely to hodl. thanks for correcting and your insights.

[26-Sep-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody did, but could have happened any block prior to recent fix

[26-Sep-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
other than the 2016 block diff adjusting period, the total supply will be the same

[26-Sep-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
unless there was a sudden 90% drop in hashrate (unlikely) any gradual drop will be adjusted for and total supply would be the same

[26-Sep-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
now, whether the "new" miners are more or less likely to hodl than sell... this is not knowable, if anything the percentage sold could go up, increasing the supply.

[26-Sep-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the only think we can conclude from a massive drop in price is a lot of hashrate will be forced to be turned off. What else can be guessed would only be a guess

` But as a miner if I am below BE thinking from a business perspective I would shut off mining to minimize running costs`
As a professional miner, that says to me that you have 0 actual belief in the longevity of the currency itself and I'll address that in a bit, but first I must do a bit of "window shopping" to address how off the math is in the selection of a vanilla S9 in the 1st place (and then I'll come back to the insane idea that Core doesn't already have a "emergency hardfork" [that adjusts the diff formula] prepared for lack of hash after bcash created essentially the same issue).

`Genie says btc is a shitcoin and isn’t worth 4k.`
You're 1/2 right, because I said it should max at ~$4200 (not under $4k)

[26-Sep-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bpkdasbaum Given your pricing of $6900 based on a $780 13.5TH S9, shouldn't the BE cost be much closer to $3200 with the use of this miner:
