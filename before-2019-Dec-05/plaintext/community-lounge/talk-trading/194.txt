from day one.

in short:
“I have a fifty dollar note here ... willing to swap with ten dollar note yuan”  works
“I have 2 twentys and a ten ... willing to swap with ten dollar note yuan”  does not

👍 understood

[09-Oct-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
so really how hard is this to understand?

[09-Oct-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
people seem to spend more time saying they dont understand it, than the 5 minutes it would take to learn it

[09-Oct-18 10:44 AM] house#8741
Is not now 😝

[09-Oct-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure why

[09-Oct-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and then blame the atomic swaps for being hard to understand

[09-Oct-18 10:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not that it's hard; imo, most just never take the time to try to understand and just keep trying to apply what they are used to knowing

[09-Oct-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so where is my 0 calorie ice cream?

[09-Oct-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also why a GUI is so dam'd hard to make 😛

[09-Oct-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Well Bittrex doesn't work like that`

[09-Oct-18 10:47 AM] house#8741
There are many ‘creams’ I could freeze and blend, not sure they would be tasty tho

[09-Oct-18 10:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[09-Oct-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry, not willing to spend any effort and it must be just as good

[09-Oct-18 10:47 AM] house#8741
You buy them already that way

Processed

[09-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I want the benefit of 0 calories, but not willing to spend any extra effort at all, and will complain until it tastes just as good

[09-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be free too

[09-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt have any calories, so it should be free

[09-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
until you make such an ice cream it wont go mainstream

[09-Oct-18 10:49 AM] house#8741
Hehe, ok you are pushing your point hard, I understand much better now

[09-Oct-18 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and will complain until it tastes just as good`
For the 1st few months I was there, I'd bet that there were people in #dev-tradebots that swore that was me 😛

[09-Oct-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
to gain the benefit of atomic swaps, you need to spend at least 5 minutes understanding the basics

[09-Oct-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, then use token based systems

[09-Oct-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810

all i care about UTXO is that it allows smart contract CCs to scale along with tx scaling 🤓

[09-Oct-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all i care about UTXOs is that I don't have enough of them over 10KMD

[09-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo makes the CC much safer, no chance of issuing gazillions of coins due to contract error

[09-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
in a balance based system, if some contract bug (that all nodes agree to) has some sort of overflow error (yes has happened), then the coin supply changes

[09-Oct-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
with utxo system, only specific utxo are at risk

[09-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo based systems have a chain going back to the coinbase they were mined in

[09-Oct-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
balance based systems act a bit like a mixer and it becomes a bit probabilistic the history of any specific coins

[09-Oct-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
every reason I'm so invested in PIRATE, with all t txes all it takes is enough computing power and you can track pretty much every satoshi

[09-Oct-18 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now, if you'd just make me an exchange to trade it on, that'd be nice

0 calorie ice cream is easy

[09-Oct-18 11:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just stick your finger down your throat when you’re done

[09-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
The heaving might actually burn calories making it negative calorie ice cream

[09-Oct-18 11:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do it enough and you’ll lose even more weight in the form of stomach acid eroded teeth

I like that we are on a coin extinction period

[09-Oct-18 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact that a coin can be killed by a delisting, in and of itself is wrong

[09-Oct-18 11:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I do like that binance is doing coin evaluations

[09-Oct-18 11:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I mean, polo had BTCD listed for more than a year after it was declared dead.

[09-Oct-18 11:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is unethical from an exchange standpoint imo

I think that it will non-impressively happen and not really prove much of anything.

[09-Oct-18 01:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They’re dPoW

[09-Oct-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
not quite

[09-Oct-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
not all nodes are updated

[09-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So they’re forked then

[09-Oct-18 01:20 PM] snowdamn#2414
👀

[09-Oct-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the mining nodes and the exchanges, explorers are updated, only non-updating user nodes would go on a fork and they just need to update. it not like any double spend will be done against a lone end user

[09-Oct-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_was not aware of the switch to dPoW_

[09-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So the scheme would be what, privately mine an offline fork, make a spend on the main net, then bring the private fork online with >51% hashpower?

[09-Oct-18 01:24 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Of all the low hashrate coins out there to attack, I find it ironic he chooses one of the few protected by dPoW. If my tinfoil hat wasn't so tight I would put it on and claim a setup to pump KMD.

[09-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont want to say it is dPoW yet as it is not fully dPoW
