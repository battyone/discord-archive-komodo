maybe we can all just join hands like care bears and use the power of care to make it all better.

I have feeling it's not gonna stop until Binance shuts out the ussa. after that d-day. true price discovery may begin again.

[01-Sep-19 01:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
if the kmd logo had been on the binance usa press release. this likely would not be happeningz

Yeah @Hollowman9000 I love how venmo and cashapp track all my purchases. Otherwise how would I be able to keep my privacy completely abdicated

@allbits

[01-Sep-19 02:02 AM] allbits#5898
Because the solutions for that are not built and propagated yet. You are very early on this. Stick with it.

[01-Sep-19 02:04 AM] allbits#5898
Personal privacy is still not considered a must have. One day it will be considered de rigueur. And all centralised services and sokutions will fall.

[01-Sep-19 10:05 AM] Markus#5464
in usd probably yes but usd is inflationary so the longer it takes the less it will be worth anyway
