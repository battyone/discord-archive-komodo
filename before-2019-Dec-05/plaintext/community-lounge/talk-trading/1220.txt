already did those things

[29-Nov-19 01:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
bitpanda support would be your next best bet

[29-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
pff but then I would prob need to prove shit with my id etc

[29-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and dont really feel like doing that

[29-Nov-19 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
better start searching my recovery codes then

[29-Nov-19 01:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
isn't it possible to get the recovery code from your account?

[29-Nov-19 02:01 PM] coingirl87#6489
@Cryptoon  every 2,5 days üòâ

[29-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no only 100k every 2,5days :p

[29-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@mrlynch yeah but you need to save it when enabling 2FA

[29-Nov-19 02:18 PM] coingirl87#6489
No you are wrong

[29-Nov-19 02:20 PM] coingirl87#6489
Nope ...i was wrong üôà

[29-Nov-19 02:20 PM] coingirl87#6489
I read 640m volume

[29-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm but I was wrong in my calcs @coingirl87

[29-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As I said 1%

[29-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But 1% is 640M not 64M in daily trading

[29-Nov-19 02:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Is there any DEX for sale at the moment in the atomic dex app? Can i see orderbook on my computer?

[29-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hahaha

[29-Nov-19 02:31 PM] CoinKing88#1540
How do i read that? 186 DEX for sale @ 20KMD each?

[29-Nov-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yes something like that

[29-Nov-19 03:15 PM] coingirl87#6489
@Cryptoon lol...so we both was wrong and right

[29-Nov-19 03:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Every 25 days seems very long time for me...thats why i was skeptical

[29-Nov-19 03:17 PM] coingirl87#6489
So you will get 12$ for 1 dex/month

[29-Nov-19 03:19 PM] coingirl87#6489
At actually prices for 1 dex you will have break even after 1.26 month

[29-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Neko#5830
is dex only available on atomicdex?

[29-Nov-19 03:19 PM] coingirl87#6489
Thats why 20kmd per dex is too low

[29-Nov-19 03:20 PM] coingirl87#6489
So please holder of dex.....dont sell dex at such a low level

[29-Nov-19 03:38 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Dont trade with that dex order, something is wrong with it. Check atomic dex channel, orders failing over and over and you lose your fee

[29-Nov-19 03:39 PM] jorian#4555
@Neko yes

[29-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Neko#5830
good means people need to use atomicdex

[29-Nov-19 04:05 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Anybody know what's going on with binance wallet maintenance and why they need 120 confs for deposit when they could accept it after first notarization? https://twitter.com/Xessive72/status/1200278651692109825?s=20

What do you call an exchange that has:

1. 120 network conformations for a coin ( $KMD)
2. $KMD wallet in maintenance for over a week
3. No ETA / Status updates about maintenance

[29-Nov-19 04:15 PM] Neko#5830
I opened a support ticket last week asking them to lower the number I suggest people do the same

[29-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Markus#5464
Doubt they will, atomicdex even listed binance usd for free but binance didnt return the favor for binance US even if ppl tweeted about it

[29-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Neko#5830
yeah they gave me a standard reply

[29-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
It seem to me that binance and everyone in industry feel that kmd is serious competitor and competitors must be downplayed when ever they can. True dex vs binance's fake dex and forced fake token platform that bnbchain is.

There is not much upside room to stay on that cloud.  Hopefully traders don't do anything unthinkable like go and break out from that cloud.

[30-Nov-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand those clouds. looks like poison gas and more poison gas.

[30-Nov-19 07:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I just remembered, if it goes into the green poison gas thats good

[30-Nov-19 07:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Red poison gas bad

the ‚Äúhead-shoulders‚Äù similar  figure on the chart after which the bullish trend usually ends but the technical indicators indicate a purchase, and given that technical analysis in cryptocurrencies may not work at all, you can expect the market to go against

[30-Nov-19 08:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
H&S would imply we go to 6k again

[30-Nov-19 08:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Invalidated if we break 10k ish again

[30-Nov-19 08:29 AM] Flint#6435
if in the next couple of days we break through the upper border of the cloud, a powerful upward movement will begin, it seems that everything indicates that we will take the next peak

[30-Nov-19 08:34 AM] Flint#6435
and do not forget that because of closed deposits on binance, a deficit of coins is created there because of the inability to add to the market additionally and buyers have to deal only with the mass of coins that are already on the exchange and it can be much less than those who want to buy add here fundamental analysis and technical indicators pointing to the bulls and get a bull run, but that's where the top of this run is a good question

[30-Nov-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
with exchanges reopening in the next days, we will finally see what will happen with cross exchange arbitrage available again in addition to new deposits and new purchases from people who are waiting to see what happens to price before buying

[30-Nov-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But bittrex was still open yesterday

[30-Nov-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would assume most whales have multiple accounts on the bigger exchanges so they can arb

[30-Nov-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and binance has over 10 million KMD so plenty to sell. i dont think the correction from markets reopening will be that big

[30-Nov-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD has held up very well in spite of BTC dominance reversing its downtrend and going up by a percent

[30-Nov-19 12:04 PM] marktyler#0324
Where can you buy/trade "DEX" other than the atomic dex app

[30-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
That 20kmd per DEX order is messing up the dex/kmd market. Can't buy anything because it matches to that order and fails

[30-Nov-19 01:35 PM] marktyler#0324
Is 20 kmd per dex a good price?

[30-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Lennart#9331
up to you to judge.. I'd say absolutely, it's a bargain

[30-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Lennart#9331
has been trading 25-35 KMD lately. we'll see if 20 KMD is the "floor" hehe

[30-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Acura#2748
I can sell DEX for 30KMD if you are searching for large amounts

[30-Nov-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
@Patrick Crypto just select another order

[30-Nov-19 03:11 PM] jorian#4555
you can't

[30-Nov-19 03:12 PM] jorian#4555
it matches to that order because it's the lowest price and then it fails

[30-Nov-19 03:12 PM] jorian#4555
patrick can set an order himself though and wait for others to dump on him

[30-Nov-19 03:12 PM] Alright#0419
update the app, you can pick specific orders now

how would one go about that? i don't see specific order selection arguments in buy / sell

[30-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
DEX tab, select first coin, input amount, select second coin

[30-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
"Click to see 3 orders" etcetc

[30-Nov-19 03:16 PM] jorian#4555
and after that? can you select a more expensive order?

yes, it shows you each individual bob order

[30-Nov-19 03:19 PM] bishop#9773
Can confirm.
