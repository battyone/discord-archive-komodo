I know where I am in financial terms, and confident enough I'll do just fine. not worried, but has to move carefully when low on funds to live on. that's all.

[06-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337

[06-Aug-19 12:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[06-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder true

[06-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Caglio#3337
but we survived bear market

[06-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Caglio#3337
i doubt we have a lot more power to survive this

[06-Aug-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Markus thoughts on binance people just cashing out before US customers get locked out of binance?

[06-Aug-19 12:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
‚ÄúMilestone 50th user‚Äù made me laugh. Cagliari, Komodo should hire you to write the history of the coin

[06-Aug-19 12:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm still surviving bear market, it's not over yet, since I'm in alts üòÑ

[06-Aug-19 12:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
Cagliari?  How the fuck did it auto correct to that?  Caglio

[06-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Caglio#3337
@meatspoon i know bro, ill make a blog where I will make fun out of all these memes that happened during my life with komodo

[06-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Caglio#3337
im sure we will get to more public than our marketing team did

[06-Aug-19 12:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
A blog isn‚Äôt high tech enough for KMD tech, bro. Blogs can not contain it.

[06-Aug-19 12:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
Better make a VR game

[06-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Caglio#3337
sure some will laugh, but some will buy, just for memes

[06-Aug-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
we need a infograph

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] meatspoon#7860
We need a VR helmet so you can ride a virtual Komodo Dragon past a bunch of virtual displays like in a museum

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
yesss

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
and then waking dragon mission

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
where dragon is asleep

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
and you poke him with a stick to wake him up

[06-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
but he refuses ro cooperate

[06-Aug-19 12:32 PM] Caglio#3337
as kmd marketing refuses to do anything

[06-Aug-19 12:32 PM] meatspoon#7860
And at the end of the virtual tour, the Komodo Dragon turns around and eats your cocknballs off and all your money disappears. It burns and scream, ‚Äú1/tech, bitch!‚Äù

[06-Aug-19 12:33 PM] Caglio#3337
sounds too real

[06-Aug-19 12:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, I like waking dragon mission. Might need a stethoscope to check to make sure this lizard is breathing.

[06-Aug-19 12:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
We are almost at the part of the pizza that touches the floor and gets hair all over it.

[06-Aug-19 12:38 PM] Caglio#3337
i am a bit scared to give it two more

[06-Aug-19 12:38 PM] Caglio#3337
but is there a ten second rule

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
Lol, we are gonna scrape along the bottom of the barber shop floor for 10 weeks, not 10 secs

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] Caglio#3337
i have the same feeling

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
This slice of pizza is gonna look like my wife‚Äôs beaver in the winter time.

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] Caglio#3337
hhahahahahaa

[06-Aug-19 12:40 PM] Caglio#3337
everything is fine

[06-Aug-19 12:40 PM] Caglio#3337
time to accumulate more kmd

[06-Aug-19 12:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
bashing on the marketing, logo, rebrand, price action, etc. every fucking day, is not helping. this is an open source suite of software. unlike many, it works and it's real, on a live network. it does things no one else's software can do. And it's not going to zero unless btc goes to zero.   saying otherwise is fud and just shows a lack of understanding.

[06-Aug-19 12:55 PM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks Its not going to zero ? well its pretty damn close

[06-Aug-19 12:56 PM] Caglio#3337
I think someone should inform komodo dragon

[06-Aug-19 12:56 PM] Markus#5464
Dont think so there is any big named alt that stand a chance against btc atm, litecoin, eth, bnb all getting slaughtered

[06-Aug-19 12:56 PM] Caglio#3337
