Anyone here stacking silver or gold?

[17-Jul-18 09:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Looking to get started but got no idea where to start. Half these online forums are people preparing for doomsday/SHTF ü§î

1kg silver bar vs 3 10oz bars, with the 10oz bars costing 8% premium (gram for gram)

Math logic says buy the kilo, forums say buy the 10oz for liquidity, dealer says buy both üòÇ

[17-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Would paying 1 to 2% premiun on shiny, minted bars be worthwhile? Or go for weight only, and people who buy off you generally dont care for aesthetics?

[17-Jul-18 09:24 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm far from expert but I have mostly 1oz coins, easier to liquidate in small batches as needed

[17-Jul-18 09:25 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
there are online vendors that accept crypto, in europe Bitgild.com

[17-Jul-18 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Deleted User not sure about silver, but for gold I think you are best off buying krugerands or something like that

[17-Jul-18 09:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Deleted User Rule is easy in, easy out. Get things close to spot. 1KG is the biggest i would suggest and 1oz gold.

[17-Jul-18 09:29 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I like the 1oz austrian philarmoniker, very beautiful coins

[17-Jul-18 09:29 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
and sold also in 500 pieces box

[17-Jul-18 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Get stuff that has a global price set, those are most liquid and easiest to trade

[17-Jul-18 09:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Milk spots kill the premium, goes for any with premiums

[17-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thats the thing I dont get, everyone says its easier to liquidate 1oz coins etc, but the bullion buys kg bricks back on the same day. By liquidate, do you mean sell at close to purchase price to a 2nd party/not a dealer?

[17-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Havent experienced selling or buying so not sure how the 2nd hand market goes or how hard it is to find buyers

Buying maple leafs here..

[17-Jul-18 09:50 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
To never sell.. just in case of emergency or strict nesessary

[17-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
i mean for $10 more to have a perfectly shaped bar thats shiny + tamper proofing compared to the 1kg cast, seems decent. Not really in this for those 1% 2% gains for investing, I got komodo for that üòõ But more store of value/just in case shit does hit the fan üòõ

[17-Jul-18 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When shit hits the fan it's easier to pay for your meat/food with bullion than a kilo bar :p

[17-Jul-18 10:02 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I buy coins.. 1/4 oz and 1/2 oz

@Deleted User You are paying 8% premium over spot

Cigarettes and whiskey will have more value than bullion come shit hits the fan

Dont think people will need the ammo around here, people would probably prefer some white ox and some whacky tobaccy
