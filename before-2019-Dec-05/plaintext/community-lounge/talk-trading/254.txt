Yeah it’ll take someone more fluent on the subject to address the question

thanks @jorian i have rt'd

[26-Oct-18 04:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@crumb Do you have to be online to transact on MimbleWimble? I thought I read this recently.

[26-Oct-18 04:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Is zero knowledge appliaed to all transactions?

[26-Oct-18 04:32 PM] crumb#2550
i'm not very knowledgeable with that stuff. it just seemed a good opportunity to point out the positives of zcash tech vs grin. the problem is i don't know what those positives are exactly 😃 
need a person with deeper knowledge like @jl777c

@FishyGuts

[26-Oct-18 04:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Assuming zcash is used like Pirate is.. mandatory privacy, You would want to find out if Grin is A)Mandatory Private, and B) if you really do need to be online to transact on MimbleWimble, which I have read.  
If the answer to A is no or B is yes, then there's no argument.   
If the answer to A is yes AND B is no, then you'll need to dig deeper. 


In My opinion based on my limited knowledge 😛

[26-Oct-18 04:47 PM] crumb#2550
thanks Fishy!

Zerocoin payments from wallet to wallet and complete address-less transactions. the world's first full zerocoin wallet to wallet deposit system. 

there is literally no way the history can be compromised even tracing ip etc

The blockchain privacy is so powerful that there are no other factors that can expose the user. Revolutionizing privacy in all of crypto!

[26-Oct-18 05:26 PM] NIXfra#2279
share address?

[26-Oct-18 05:27 PM] NIXfra#2279
where you saw the addresses?

[26-Oct-18 05:28 PM] NIXfra#2279
you can see the addresses in the blockchain or that showing Anonymous?

[26-Oct-18 05:29 PM] NIXfra#2279
sorry but maybe you must watching better the video…..

[26-Oct-18 05:30 PM] NIXfra#2279
so where you saw "you need to share the address every time"?

[26-Oct-18 05:31 PM] NIXfra#2279
??? where you want i send you the coin??

[26-Oct-18 05:33 PM] NIXfra#2279
you must tell me your address of course...if not how i can send you private transaction (blockchain )

[26-Oct-18 05:47 PM] NIXfra#2279
wait less days and you will know everything when the technical paper come out

[26-Oct-18 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I know you need to be online for mimblewimble ... also privacy is forced as there are not UTXO... the blockchain is not a chain as such.

[26-Oct-18 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no address's

[26-Oct-18 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you cant have a balance

[26-Oct-18 05:59 PM] NIXfra#2279
If it "already exists" will you be kind enough to show me a similar transaction on blockchain? @Deleted User

[26-Oct-18 06:12 PM] NIXfra#2279
you never know what the receiver does with those coins and nether does the network
Privacy set of zerocoin is so powerful, enabling deposit system like this makes it arguably the most powerful privacy transaction protocol

[26-Oct-18 06:12 PM] NIXfra#2279
You aren’t actually sending coins through addressses, you are sending them using zero knowledge proofs
Which allows you to spend them later without compromising where they came from

[26-Oct-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but the amounts are not hidden with zerocoin protocol (predecessor to zcash protocol)

[26-Oct-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and if amounts are not hidden, the amount data can be analyzed

[26-Oct-18 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so if amounts are visible it is not the most private blockchain, that goes to PIRATE

{Reactions}
💯 (3) 

[26-Oct-18 06:22 PM] NIXfra#2279
not if the privacy set of each denomination is large
good luck analyzing 1000's of similar tx's that cannot be distinguised from each other

[26-Oct-18 06:22 PM] NIXfra#2279
and with NIX, each privacy set for each denomination is already large, and will get even bigger as the network adopts the simple privacy metrics

[26-Oct-18 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
well something to analyze is more than nothing to analyze. users could do silly things and allow themselves to be deanonymized via large amounts transferred with external information leaked

There is following sentence: These are your private coins from Ghosting NIX. You can convert ghosted NIX to public coins.

[26-Oct-18 06:25 PM] crumb#2550
Does that mean that privacy is optional?

[26-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
He's copying and pasting someone elses response. Get them in the channel to talk. Other wise it's just a shill post with buzz words.

[26-Oct-18 06:25 PM] crumb#2550
you can have transparent coins also

[26-Oct-18 06:26 PM] crumb#2550
?

[26-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, then it is leak city

{Reactions}
😂 

[26-Oct-18 06:27 PM] NIXfra#2279
yes sure. optional

[26-Oct-18 06:27 PM] crumb#2550
oh man. then it's not even in the same league as PIRATE

[26-Oct-18 06:28 PM] crumb#2550
if you give users option to use transparent addresses when they want, then most of the privacy flies right out of the window

[26-Oct-18 06:29 PM] crumb#2550
sad, but true

[26-Oct-18 06:30 PM] NIXfra#2279
but give both option i though is better

[26-Oct-18 06:31 PM] crumb#2550
no, it's not. because there are too many ways you can correlate amounts, timing etc

[26-Oct-18 06:31 PM] crumb#2550
too many ways to screw it up

[26-Oct-18 06:32 PM] crumb#2550
privacy has to be 100% forced all the time or it doesn't work effectively

[26-Oct-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@NIXfra not admitting to basic facts, you are looking foolish and probably that is not your goal

[26-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Markus#5464
is it possible to buy KMD with fiat somehow that doesnt take long time to process?

[26-Oct-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i think bitpanda in EU

[26-Oct-18 06:52 PM] Vertigo#0439
Hey Nix is the shit ok don't pop his bubble.

[26-Oct-18 07:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitpanda is pretty fast indeed @Markus

[26-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Markus#5464

[26-Oct-18 09:20 PM] actionslacks#4072

[26-Oct-18 09:20 PM] Tek#5253
im not sure he's been pushing up the price until 23

[26-Oct-18 09:20 PM] Tek#5253
but now he seems silent for a bit

[26-Oct-18 09:20 PM] Tek#5253
he was flashing buy walls

[26-Oct-18 09:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
he would have pushed it way higher if wasn't a pro

[26-Oct-18 09:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
I can buy a bunch if u want, then it will go back down

[26-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Tek#5253
i sold some at 22k

[26-Oct-18 09:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
ok I'll see what I can do

[26-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Tek#5253
ive

[26-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Tek#5253
i coldn't wait

[26-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Tek#5253
I bought.

[26-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Tek#5253
I finally have my target amount of KMD

[26-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Tek#5253
now to get the wallet and put it away for a year or two

[26-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Tek#5253
here is it delegated staking or does my computer need to be online all the time?

[26-Oct-18 10:13 PM] Tek#5253
or how does that work again on KM chain

[26-Oct-18 10:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just on chain accumulation

[26-Oct-18 10:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont need to have a node online or whatever

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just have an utxo of at least 10kmd for an hour and it starts accumulating

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
I can stake without my computer being online right?

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
ok cool 😃

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
so , make "wallet" send funds to it and I'm already staking

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
just to be clear

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
ok thnx

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
nice

[26-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although its more like accrueing rewards instead of staking

[26-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But thats semantics

[26-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Tek#5253
It's ok, I'm just accumulating a few coins and I'm ready to move all my shit i've collected in wallets to hold for a year or two

[26-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And claim your rewards at least once a month

[26-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Tek#5253
if I want to trade I buy more with fiat and trade with that

[26-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Tek#5253
but my holding stuff is ready

[26-Oct-18 10:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
