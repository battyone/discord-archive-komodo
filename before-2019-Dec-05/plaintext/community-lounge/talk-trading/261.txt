1 last security question cause im confused as fuck

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
hypothetically if i was infected by someone with a bit of skill

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
And they log in to my shit, use my wallets, go through my email, log in to exchanges

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
would they possibly be doing it through my own ip

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
at home

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
or will it always show where they are

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause every place ive contacted says no suspicious log ins or ips out of place

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
(my ip is whitelisted every other ip needs 2fa)

[03-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
can they like connect to me to connect to places or somethin

[03-Nov-18 08:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
making whitelisting a stupid idea

[03-Nov-18 08:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a worm can do things on it's own like it happened to genie.

[03-Nov-18 08:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a worm can spread itself over network, and even wiping your 1 device can not get rid of it.

[03-Nov-18 08:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
today even the routers has openwrt in it. they are pretty secure, but some reouters with default pass can still invite worms to host as a backup for them.

[03-Nov-18 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and router is 1 central point of home network

[03-Nov-18 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so you have to very careful

[03-Nov-18 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you say no logs found etc. then most probably it's not incoming and then outgoing connecting, it's just outgoing via worm etc.

[03-Nov-18 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there can be many types of complex worms and virus and what nots

[03-Nov-18 08:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
windows is itself a worm/virus/*(&$(*%

[03-Nov-18 08:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no need of virus to have on it.

[03-Nov-18 08:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and for corporate they give you a preinstalled virus. Windows. and enforce you to use it.

[03-Nov-18 08:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you get paranoid due to any X reason, sometimes it can do good to you, but also a disturbed mind can do an harm to self too.

[03-Nov-18 08:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
be patient, be cool, take deep breath if feel pressured. think twice before wiping, or encrypting your data, always make sure you have the backup or even multiple backups on site or off site, and then proceed with your security practices.

[03-Nov-18 08:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
make a schedule of your security cycle and stick to it and be punctual on these backups/cycles.

[03-Nov-18 08:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
make things semi automatic and not just fully automatic.

[03-Nov-18 08:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if you are anonymous, just be anonymous. there's nothing good with identity revealed over internet.

I left my macbook pro since I got the news of nz customs madness

[03-Nov-18 08:46 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
what you mean you left it? on the airport ?

[03-Nov-18 08:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
left it as wiped it, reinstalled os, and placed in storage box.

[03-Nov-18 08:47 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
probably best way would be to have all in cloud service and only use empty connection device in such case

[03-Nov-18 08:47 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
or use a flash drive (if they canot find it with you)

[03-Nov-18 08:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yesterday I tried again installing ubuntu on it. installed using external keyboard/mouse and a usb dongle lan with lan cable hooked to it.
solved the onboard keyboard touchpad issue.
read further that the wifi will still suck, and the touchbar couldn't be solved properly.
left that idea of using macbook pro as linux machine and just put it back to storage.
hating apple for such non support for linux.

[03-Nov-18 08:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I like small yet powerful laptop. a 12" or 13" laptop with good ram is what I'd like.
macbook hardware is amazing, very very expensive, slim, but doesn't support linux.

[03-Nov-18 08:51 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I got Acer - also wifi problems

[03-Nov-18 08:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's making me stick with librem

[03-Nov-18 08:51 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
on ubuntu

[03-Nov-18 08:51 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it's Qualcom wifi device issue

[03-Nov-18 08:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this laptop at that time had costed me around 7k nzd

250g ssd, 2tb nvme

[03-Nov-18 08:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I hate onboard wifi of librem

[03-Nov-18 08:52 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Apple = well overpriced / except the design maybe

[03-Nov-18 08:57 AM] gcharang#6833
I am very happy with my Lenovo thinkpad p52s - powerful + runs Ubuntu 16.04 well. no tinkering needed.

[03-Nov-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a P50 love it ..

[03-Nov-18 09:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@gcharang @blackjok3r how's the wifi performance from onboard wifi in linux os on those p50 and p52 ?

[03-Nov-18 09:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that 801.11ac wifi or 801.11n wifi ?

[03-Nov-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its ok ... It used to play up on me when i first got it, but hasnt happened for some time now

[03-Nov-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on arch linux, so its usually pretty up to date

[03-Nov-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
on librem the wifi if near to router, it gives 801.11 ac performance. go away like 10-20 feet it gives 801.11n performance

[03-Nov-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I had a real trouble working with this laptop when I traveled last year

[03-Nov-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the hotel wifi was terrible and on top of it, my laptop

[03-Nov-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my friend's little macbook pro had no issues at all

[03-Nov-18 10:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at that time I really really missed my macbook pro

[03-Nov-18 10:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because I had to sync komodo native blockchain to further work on stuff.

[03-Nov-18 10:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thinking if it's possible to just upgrade the wifi card on this laptop ü§î

[03-Nov-18 10:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
since it's plug/unplug able

[03-Nov-18 11:38 AM] gcharang#6833
@grewalsatinder I think it is atleast 802.11n wifi . It had windows when i bought it. I wiped it and installed ubuntu 16.04 wifi worked right of the bat. No need to search for other drivers. (All hardware worked directly - including trackpad and keyboard )

[03-Nov-18 11:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
