[26-Mar-19 12:08 PM] Caglio#3337
I remember reading a reddit post of coins that survived and failed

[26-Mar-19 12:08 PM] Caglio#3337
and I am sure there was a list of at least 10 other coins noone ever heard of today

[26-Mar-19 12:08 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Mar-19 12:10 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Mar-19 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

it does seem there are a few dozen coins in the 2011 timeframe

[26-Mar-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but i think only LTC got onto coinbase

[26-Mar-19 12:12 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Mar-19 12:12 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah thats what I was saying

[26-Mar-19 12:12 PM] Caglio#3337
ltc made it even then

[26-Mar-19 12:12 PM] Caglio#3337
they did start one of the first

[26-Mar-19 12:13 PM] Caglio#3337
but they are adopted, and telling how shitty coin it is.... I dont think they are

[26-Mar-19 12:13 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Mar-19 12:13 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Mar-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
LTC has basically no new tech

[26-Mar-19 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Where has LTC been "adopted" outside of inter-space things?

[26-Mar-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810

But my whole talk here

[26-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Caglio#3337
wasnt about how they made something spectacular

[26-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Caglio#3337
Or how they invented hot water

[26-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Mar-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
well back in those days, being on coinbase probably is all that matters. whichever coin that was the only alternative to BTC would be big today

[26-Mar-19 12:15 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Mar-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810

it says, at 12 december 2017: buying LTC is extremely risky I expect us to have a multi year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ( $48 to $4 ) so if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy

[26-Mar-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
so thats when LTC was like 400 dollars lmao

[26-Mar-19 12:19 PM] Caglio#3337
