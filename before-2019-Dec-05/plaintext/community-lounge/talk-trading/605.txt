[06-May-19 10:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[06-May-19 10:31 AM] Tek#5253

[06-May-19 10:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Isn’t that a quid or shekel or whatever

[06-May-19 10:32 AM] Tek#5253

[06-May-19 10:32 AM] Tek#5253

10% per year inflation is less than a lot of PoW coins

[06-May-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
only PoW coins in their 4th halving would have lower inflation

[06-May-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all relative

[06-May-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
but if inflation was the only factor then 0% inflation coins would be a sure thing

[06-May-19 10:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
To be honest, the thing that most possible investors i know always look for is how the coin they buy will make users buy more coins. They look for the "lock in catch"

[06-May-19 10:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Komodo doesnt have that lock in logic and investors tend to think it wont have demand for that reason.

[06-May-19 10:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Like gas in eth or ram in eos

[06-May-19 10:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is the reason i like kmd over other coins btw. But i have had this conversation before with many people

[06-May-19 10:46 AM] Tek#5253
well when buying KMD a factor for me to buy more coins was the fact of the interests.

[06-May-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
I started buying KMD uhm half a year ago? I don't know, but it was mid or late bear market. I bought mostly bc I was looking for an ETH that works but then I kept buying bc you can gather interests . and it would probably be smart to just try to buy a good coin that has rewards, so I can collect them during the duration of the bear

[06-May-19 10:48 AM] Tek#5253
soooooo a lock in factor for KMD can be the rewards

[06-May-19 10:48 AM] Tek#5253
> he does'nt have a crypto bank account thats getting 5% interest

[06-May-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
was part of my reasoning for buying more kmd

[06-May-19 10:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Rewards are not a lock in

[06-May-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
also a reason for keeping and buying more was bc maybe I wanted to start trading directly from KMD

[06-May-19 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Buying for the reward is not a great reason to buy since the market can move 5% in a day. The tech and the never ending use cases should be  the primary reason.

Kmd does have the "gateway" effect to the ecosystem

[06-May-19 10:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But at this stage of development it still doesnt look so attractive since most projects are still in development.

[06-May-19 10:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The issue for most is getting these projects done with little or almost no budget.

[06-May-19 10:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Once the ecosystem is more mature, kmd will have a natural demand as a gateway for many of the dapps

[06-May-19 10:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I like the analogy of "most coins are building a building, komodo is building a city"

[06-May-19 11:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just stack 576 block fillers into the mempool and let them eat?

[06-May-19 11:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
(For a day, 576 tx)

[06-May-19 11:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Though 500MB is going to take some time to transmit so maybe not

[06-May-19 11:37 AM] klein#5233
looks like bitifinex is the only place you trade zcash on leverage

[06-May-19 11:38 AM] klein#5233
only 2x

[06-May-19 11:41 AM] klein#5233
if you are going to be that stupid to put any money on bitfinex you might aswell put some low bids on and hope a low liquidity spike

[06-May-19 11:42 AM] Tek#5253
someone here convinced me to dump my zcash last week

[06-May-19 11:42 AM] Tek#5253

I'll give a TL:DR Komodo has been doing the "focus on tech" meme that you hear all so often and they've just gotten to the part where they are starting marketing. Right now they're currently going through a re-branding and they're upgrading their apps/ barter dexs UI and overall use to be more user friendly for people who aren't techy.

RED Fox Lab an IEO ontop of KMD (The twitter I linked) is suppose to be to KMD what Red hat Labs was to Linux. Since Komodo is a decentralized project and there's no CEO or a core person that can connect businesses. Red Fox Labs does that, they start projects then bring people in from the industry of those projects to take over. Point is Komodo is just getting the ball rolling on marketing and implementing itself

[06-May-19 04:37 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Truth be told, the name of the coin is also the reason why I didn't buy it. Then again I'm not an important person so it doesn't matter what I do.
