This will fireback on governments eventually.

[03-Mar-19 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no

[03-Mar-19 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Waves is like 2014 version of SuperNET Lite, and NXT Asset Exchange of 2013-2014

bitpanda only uses a percentage around marketprice indeed, withdrawing doesn't cost anything. once it is in the EUR wallet, you can withdraw it for free

[03-Mar-19 10:42 AM] nocturnal#2177

[03-Mar-19 10:43 AM] nocturnal#2177
so barter dex is a decentralized exchange where transactions are recorded in komodo chain?

[03-Mar-19 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no

[03-Mar-19 10:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
transactions are recorded on whatever the coins are being traded

[03-Mar-19 10:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is not a proxy decentralised exchange

[03-Mar-19 10:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's atomic swaps

[03-Mar-19 10:44 AM] nocturnal#2177
ahh ok

[03-Mar-19 10:44 AM] nocturnal#2177
and its up and running?

[03-Mar-19 10:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@nocturnal kraken has the lowest fees for SEPA transfers

[03-Mar-19 12:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You deposit to their bank account and usually takes 1 business day to transfer or so

[03-Mar-19 12:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitpanda also charges you for using visa or whatever

[03-Mar-19 12:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wire transfer is free, but then you can just use kraken, which only charges 0.15% trading fee

Looks like the price on Binance and Bittrex have caught up (or down?) with Huobi exchange.

[03-Mar-19 03:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
time for next move then üòÉ

[03-Mar-19 03:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although I see cryptotwitter thinking there might be a btc move coming in the following 24h, so alts might slow down?

[03-Mar-19 04:38 PM] yorklab#7270
Hate to see where kmd will be if bitcoin makes a move in either direction. Right now kmd is getting pummeled - relatively speaking.

[03-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Markus#5464
We had a bearish macd crossover on kmd daily chart

[03-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Markus#5464
Thats not a good sign

[03-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Markus#5464
unless bulls or whale try to keep it up

[03-Mar-19 04:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
we only had a golden cross a couple of days ago

[03-Mar-19 05:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
fairly high volume (for kmd) selloff

[03-Mar-19 05:15 PM] Sdunbar#5064
It's only proper that I immediately take a loss on investment anytime I buy :troll_thuglife:

[03-Mar-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if your timeframe is weeks (or days), you are subject more to random fluctuations than anything else. even over months, we see a year+ long bear market, so it seems measuring gains should be from the same point in one bull/bear cycle to the next. with crypto, it seems to be 4 years likely due to BTC halving periods

[03-Mar-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody who has KMD for 4 years, I think is doing quite well

[03-Mar-19 05:18 PM] Sdunbar#5064
For sure, barring some personal financial catastrophe I will be continuing to hold

[03-Mar-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
That would be 1/50th BTCD price March 3rd 2015

[03-Mar-19 05:35 PM] Sdunbar#5064
@jl777c  What's your opinion on the current stability of bitcoin? It seems a very odd to me that it could be trading in such a narrow range

[03-Mar-19 05:35 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Has it ever been like this?

[03-Mar-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it was at $6500 stable for a long time, then it cut in half

[03-Mar-19 05:46 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Was the range that stable at 6500 as it is now?

[03-Mar-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c are u holding or trading any crypto urself or just focusing on coding?

[03-Mar-19 05:47 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I wasnt paying attention for a long time, been very caught up in other things in life until recently

[03-Mar-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it was quite stable for a month or so

[03-Mar-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus I only trade rarely, like when I was able to swap WAVES for 4 KMD in volume, i did that

[03-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
oh,for myself,that was for SuperNET

[03-Mar-19 05:51 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Is there still a decent amount of atomic swapping going on? That was fun doing that back a year or so ago

[03-Mar-19 05:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
i notice the dexstat site doesnt show any activity

[03-Mar-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont trade for myself much at all, I just sell as little as I can, just enough to pay expenses. sometimes people approach me for OTC deals and I have bought VRSC, PIRATE. long term we are in a zero to TBD value creation era and I have no idea what the TBD value of the overall crypto will be. I hodl my KMD and collect rewards.

we are transitioning to mm2, so the mm1 is being phased out

[03-Mar-19 05:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Is there any sort of timeline on MM2?

[03-Mar-19 05:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Pretty close now?

[03-Mar-19 05:53 PM] Markus#5464
SuperNET is that kmd team?

[03-Mar-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET is SuperNET, in a way it incubated KMD

[03-Mar-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
hm okay read something about them having 1% of supply of IOTA

[03-Mar-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, used to. now it is less

[03-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464

Whats ur thoughts of JP Morgan coin? gonna be competition for XRP?

[03-Mar-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont spend much time time thinking about non-crypto, be it jpmorgan coin, xrp or cattle futures

[03-Mar-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I am curious if xrp ever found their genesis block and the initial 40,000 blocks that went missing
