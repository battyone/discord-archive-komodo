Kids these days

Dafuq is coinex

[02-Jul-18 06:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Back in my day, mintpal was the shiznit

[02-Jul-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Dafuq is coinex"
Some exchange that started in Nov or Dec and likes to pump fake volumes

[02-Jul-18 06:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Naww they are way incentivising trading

[02-Jul-18 06:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They are distributing like 80% of trading revenue to coinex token holders and buying it back in large quantities against BCH BTC and ETH

[02-Jul-18 06:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
And burning when they buy

[02-Jul-18 06:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They are doing what binance did, but better

[02-Jul-18 06:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Unless their "incentive" was 2-for-1, no one is going to convince me that they had a $1billion day with BTC/USDT

[02-Jul-18 06:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
can anyone say:
beat-co-neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect

[02-Jul-18 06:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Just saying, I think they found a winning incentive mechanism to attract traders.

[02-Jul-18 06:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
And they are the original BCH base exchange.

[02-Jul-18 06:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
VIABTC is their parent company.

[02-Jul-18 06:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Bch withdrawals from coinex are free of charge

[02-Jul-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
still sounds to me like lots of "financially interdependently" bullshit

[02-Jul-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`nah no no no`

[02-Jul-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Is this real turnaround or dead cat bounce?

[02-Jul-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
hopefully both üòõ

[02-Jul-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
sell today buy tomorrow üòÉ

[02-Jul-18 06:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm hoping dead cat. If not the Asics will skyrocket in value

[02-Jul-18 06:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Count on it

[02-Jul-18 06:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
they came out the gate with rocket value

[02-Jul-18 06:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
üòÉ

[02-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Which are the "ASICS"?

[02-Jul-18 06:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea at peak crypto times s9's we're 5k on resale

[02-Jul-18 06:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Equihash in general will be the most valuable

[02-Jul-18 07:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They are profitable now and easily down -80%

[02-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Equihash?

[02-Jul-18 07:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Very low volume available

[02-Jul-18 07:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Equihash Asics will skyrocket

[02-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Increase in price is on low volume is that right?

[02-Jul-18 07:01 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They just released this month for the first time

[02-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Low volume indicates dead cat as I understand it.

[02-Jul-18 07:01 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm mining 14kmd a day imagine if Komodo tou he'd 3-7 dollars a day

[02-Jul-18 07:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what feken idiot paid 5k for an S9 (unless you count spent value vs ath value)?

[02-Jul-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Who "released this month for the first time"?

[02-Jul-18 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
do what, @olsas?

[02-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Z9‚Äôs started in the $2k range

[02-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Current pricing must be the ultimate dick punch

[02-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$850

[02-Jul-18 07:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
5.2 months until ROI

[02-Jul-18 07:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I guess we can assume the same for the next batch

[02-Jul-18 07:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
850/5.2

[02-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$5.40/z9/day

[02-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I can still live with it

[02-Jul-18 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"5.2 months until ROI"
1) in the trading room, please refer to "positive ROI" correctly (if you make 1 cent, then you have ROI)
2) where'd you get this ridiculous number?

[02-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763

Equihash PoW Mining Algorithm - List of all Equihash Coins
Do you know that compared to AMD cards; NVIDIA perform better on Equihash algorithm. True, if you own a NVIDIA GPU then pick any Equihash coin from this list and get started with mining.

[02-Jul-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
at this exact moment (and mining KMD only):
`Positive BTC ROI    
3.38619653    
Positive USD ROI    
3.466044219`

[02-Jul-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
in months

[02-Jul-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@olsas that site is way feked in info

[02-Jul-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
*on

[02-Jul-18 07:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
KMD `Block Time: 30 Seconds`
yeah, no

[02-Jul-18 07:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and it doesn't look like any of their "Block Reward"s subtract centralization fees either

[02-Jul-18 07:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie used some randomly googled site for equihash profitability

[02-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And assumed that the next batch/flood of z9‚Äôs would lower profitability In kind

[02-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Very scientific methods mind you

[02-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt question them

[02-Jul-18 07:27 PM] Yassin#3685

Someone pump heat

[02-Jul-18 07:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The coin

[02-Jul-18 07:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not the joule

[02-Jul-18 07:30 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
pamp chips as well (the asset not the snack)

[02-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ha

[02-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gimme snack chips to watch asset chips pump

1) profitability of any equipment depends on what coin you mine with it
2) I've yet to see a single site that correctly accounts for KMD NNs in "profitability "

[02-Jul-18 07:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
3) why are you still on about mining in #talk-trading ?

[02-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Because trading is where I have made my home while preparing to bring justice

[02-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Your precious mining information

[02-Jul-18 07:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gratefully accepted

[02-Jul-18 07:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We will need it

[02-Jul-18 07:36 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
#talk-trading hasn't been #talk-trading since tommy86 arrived 9 months ago

[02-Jul-18 07:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what is a "tommy86"?

[02-Jul-18 07:38 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
fella that used to give meth fueled rants in trading. thought he was a whale, but was only a lamprey.

[02-Jul-18 07:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Adderall

[02-Jul-18 07:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Was probably meth

[02-Jul-18 07:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But claimed it was adderall

[02-Jul-18 07:38 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
right

[02-Jul-18 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"fella that used to give meth fueled rants in trading." So, @Hollowman9000's alter ego?

[02-Jul-18 07:38 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
the tangents made me think it was meth

[02-Jul-18 07:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Whiskey fuels my tangents

[02-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt have much use for Rx grade material

[02-Jul-18 07:40 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
lol

[02-Jul-18 07:41 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
you talk about it like its plutonium

[02-Jul-18 07:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hardest substance I ever had to kick was nicotine

[02-Jul-18 07:42 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
how'd you do it?

[02-Jul-18 07:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Surgeries had given me a serious taste for opiates

Quitting those weren‚Äôt shit compared to vitamin N

[02-Jul-18 07:42 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
lol

[02-Jul-18 07:42 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
vit N

[02-Jul-18 07:42 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
i still struggle. want to quit, but never lasts.

[02-Jul-18 07:43 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
i have joined the genie camp

[02-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Always cold turkey

[02-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I can‚Äôt half ass a nicotine addiction

[02-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Stepping down means I do more at the lower steps

[02-Jul-18 07:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If quitting "doesn't take" then you didn't "want" to quit

[02-Jul-18 07:44 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
could be true
