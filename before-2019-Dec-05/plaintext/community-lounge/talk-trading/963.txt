Here comes BTC to ruin the party, yet again

[24-Jul-19 01:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Flash down to 8k, small rebound to complete the head and shoulders formation on the 6M view, down into oblivion sweeping all shitcoins with it

Oh, I speak of BTC

[24-Jul-19 03:04 AM] richardt#2807
If KMD goes sub $1 again, good opportunity to buy more

[24-Jul-19 03:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
CME futures rollover is the 26th, scheduled carnage is playing out

[24-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Caglio#3337

very cool

[24-Jul-19 10:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am looking for a few advanced testers for hyperDEX that have github access to report issues.

[24-Jul-19 10:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that have github access to report issues`
wouldn't that just be like anyone with a PC and 2 minutes time?

[24-Jul-19 10:50 AM] jansako#3330
I think the first part of the statement could be  more important... not sure that 'just' having access to github=advanced tester...

[24-Jul-19 10:51 AM] jansako#3330
what are you doing up already @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[24-Jul-19 10:51 AM] jansako#3330
discord shakes?

[24-Jul-19 10:52 AM] jansako#3330
@hyperDEX let me know if you need specific tests to be done...

[24-Jul-19 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"already"?

[24-Jul-19 10:52 AM] jansako#3330
isn't it like 5 am where you are?

[24-Jul-19 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
6 and we're rarely not up by 4

[24-Jul-19 10:53 AM] jansako#3330
like the eskimos in the summer... except you ain;t got the sun up yet at 4...

[24-Jul-19 10:53 AM] jansako#3330
not even we do any more

[24-Jul-19 10:54 AM] jansako#3330
at least I had the 'excuse' of the baby waking me up

[24-Jul-19 10:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If they have a ability to make a github account they are advanced enough for my grandma friendly GUI 😛

[24-Jul-19 10:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek, if I waited until sun-up I'd work till midnight in the winter 😛

[24-Jul-19 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
farming and ranching doesn't work well if you wait on the sun and weather

[24-Jul-19 10:56 AM] jansako#3330
@hyperDEX I got a Github account since last time we were testing HyperDEX :=-)

[24-Jul-19 10:56 AM] jansako#3330
I know a little something about farming, that is why I got out of that world...

[24-Jul-19 10:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[24-Jul-19 10:57 AM] jansako#3330
Going out on a Friday night? Sure, if you are back by 4am so you can get going to the market...

[24-Jul-19 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other than holiday, the last time I was "out on a Friday night" was in the early '90s 😛

[24-Jul-19 10:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jansako what os you got?

[24-Jul-19 10:59 AM] jansako#3330

indeed. In my business U gotta use what your customers use though...

[24-Jul-19 11:02 AM] jansako#3330
feeling their pain helps come up with better solutions for them as well.

[24-Jul-19 11:03 AM] jansako#3330
anyhow, are we trading with HyperDEX or what?

[24-Jul-19 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Malti you still on holiday otherwise @hyperDEX looking for testers bro

[24-Jul-19 11:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@hyperDEX swap status says 1/7, does that mean there is still 7 steps needed like before? Thought mm2.0 was less steps?

[24-Jul-19 11:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
prolly just some visual stuff?

[24-Jul-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah should just be visual, we have duck taped mm2.0 under the hood. Many things to fix but we are getting there.

[24-Jul-19 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we have duck taped mm2.0 under the hood.`
for your own sake, just make sure you end up adding sauce to make that spaghetti less sticky in the end 😉

[24-Jul-19 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

_starts DUCK chain to track the supply-line of duct tape_

[24-Jul-19 11:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
duck is better than duct obviously

[24-Jul-19 11:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
we feathered the crap out of the mm

[24-Jul-19 11:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[24-Jul-19 12:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm researching more about Komodo competitors, reading Ethereum 2.0 plans... I didn't fully realize what level of clustefuck it is compared to Komodo! There's nothing else to do than continuing improving the tech and creating migrations tools, they're doing the job for us. 
Polkadot has a broken model, a complete non-starter.  Cosmos seems the best of the bunch, still reading...

[24-Jul-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
what are the main problems with polkadot?

[24-Jul-19 12:44 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
limited number of parachains available, the get sold on auction and their availability expires without paying the rent

[24-Jul-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[24-Jul-19 12:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
i.e. you're renting a parachain

[24-Jul-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
seems to be creating artificial scarcity

[24-Jul-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess appeals to the "what is the point of holding your token" crowd, nice tax scheme

[24-Jul-19 12:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the number of parachains increases in time but still limited

[24-Jul-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
cosmos i believe requires some deposit

[24-Jul-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
one of them was permissioned block producers

[24-Jul-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and these are the best of the competition in the many chains space

[24-Jul-19 12:49 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
All of them want some tax to make the VC and token holders feel happy.. I don't believe any of them would ever adopt a similar model to Komodo, it's far from their comprehension

[24-Jul-19 12:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
All these ecosystems are being built

[24-Jul-19 12:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do any real businesses see value in using any of them?

[24-Jul-19 12:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Even ours here at KMD

[24-Jul-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
most businesses have just forked ETH

[24-Jul-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the ETH gas prevents them from using the actual ETH chain

[24-Jul-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
with komodo, there is no need to make a source level fork to avoid fees

[24-Jul-19 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What are they using it for though

[24-Jul-19 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Private network?

[24-Jul-19 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What secures it?

[24-Jul-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
why to secure it?

[24-Jul-19 01:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No outside connections?  No outside hash

[24-Jul-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
they probably have only trusted nodes since no corporate node would ever be compromised

[24-Jul-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just like govt nodes, 100% immune from being compromised

[24-Jul-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
just trust them

[24-Jul-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
they care about women and children

[24-Jul-19 01:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If this works why would they utilize antara vs forking ETH again

[24-Jul-19 01:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Outsourcing infrastructure I guess
