well, my equihash more than makes up for it; but, on whole, I'm still in + profit but down

[01-Jul-18 07:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
someone come to the hangout room!

[01-Jul-18 07:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@ComputerGenie

[01-Jul-18 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Buy me a mic and speakers and I might

[01-Jul-18 07:59 PM] bishop#9773
@ComputerGenie No one wanted to buy my bitmain coupons so I did the practical thing and bought two more asics üòâ

You, me, Hollow and the NNs will secure this network

[01-Jul-18 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm sure there's more miners than that üòõ

[01-Jul-18 08:01 PM] bishop#9773
Nonsense!

[01-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I haven‚Äôt sorted out what I‚Äôm going to do for importer # yet

[01-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I need to sort it out quick before the August/September shipment gets filled

[01-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
From bitmain

[01-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Looks like I can apply online

[01-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
During business hours

[01-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll square that away tomorrow

[01-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Some part of me thinks they‚Äôll be sitting there pondering ‚Äúto door kicker or not to door kicker?  That is the question‚Äù

[01-Jul-18 09:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
White male?  Fucking send in the door kickers

[01-Jul-18 09:20 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
By next year i would quit mining i think.
My elec rate is toooo high.. unless i can get 0.01$/kwh rate..

[01-Jul-18 09:21 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Accumulating and setting op MN etc.. would be my way.. maybe apply for NN..

[01-Jul-18 09:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Equihash mining is not profitable for you?

[01-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
asics are killing equihash too fast

[01-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Scrypt and sha256 are dominated now by low electricity cost locations sure

[01-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
looks like many equihash coins actually are going to do their best to get creative and fork away from asics

[01-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I plan on buying 9 z9‚Äôs

[01-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
might wanna hold off

[01-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I would anyways

[01-Jul-18 09:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
KMD and ZEC seem to want to let ASICs have their way but most other equihash look to be forking

[01-Jul-18 09:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt really care about anything other than KMD/Zec

[01-Jul-18 09:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fight the future all you want

[01-Jul-18 09:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
plus wasnt there a demo of a guy figuring out how to turn 3 1050ti's into equivelent of a z9 through emulation of some sort ?

[01-Jul-18 09:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How much do 3 1050ti‚Äôs cost?

[01-Jul-18 09:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And how much power do they use

[01-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ZEC founders fee bugs me, I'm all about some KMD though

[01-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
unsure off top of my head, its a good deal though as I recall when reading

[01-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
300w for 10k sols

[01-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you's pay like 25% for the 1050ti franken-rig

[01-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
those 1050ti's are super low draw

[01-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and it only worked with those for the bang/buck return

[01-Jul-18 09:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
1070's and the cost efficiency went back to the z9 I believe

[01-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Find me 27 1050ti‚Äôs

[01-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the GPU's being useful in event of an equihash fork makes the price to run them offset in my mind

[01-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Otherwise don‚Äôt care tbh

[01-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
got a short / long target for KMD?

[01-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Somewhere between 100/1000 usd

[01-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
100$ 2018 wouldnt shock me

[01-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
These are joker/shitbird valuations at the moment

[01-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
kMD has the chops

[01-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
prob one of the best coin projects out ther as i GATHER

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
2018 is fucked

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
agreed

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
2020/2021 maybe

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
$1.50 is an insult for kMD in this space

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I can hodl a few more years

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I hope I can too

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
got 100% staked in Agama

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve seen the doldrums before, nothing new

[01-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Claiming monthly

[01-Jul-18 09:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I haven‚Äôt claimed in awhile

[01-Jul-18 09:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
must do it montly!

[01-Jul-18 09:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
compounding interest at max rate!

[01-Jul-18 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"plus wasnt there a demo of a guy figuring out how to turn 3 1050ti's into equivelent of a z9 through emulation of some sort ?"
You can't even turn 3 1050ti's into equivalent of a z9 *mini* **chip** much less a Z9

[01-Jul-18 09:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
maybe it was z9 mini

[01-Jul-18 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I only saw z9 minis on bitmain

[01-Jul-18 09:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
someone pulled something off, wasnt in english

[01-Jul-18 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Where‚Äôs the full size z9‚Äôs

[01-Jul-18 09:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yeah, I wasnt aware either.. thought it was mostly just 1 equihash asic just recently released

[01-Jul-18 09:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1 z9 mini **chip** runs about the same as 1.4 1080Ti **cards**
anyone saying they can mod 3 weaker cards into 12x that is full of shit

[01-Jul-18 09:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I read it was done through reverse engineering the z9 min

[01-Jul-18 09:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
emulating it with a modified nvidia driver or some shit

[01-Jul-18 09:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
maybe it was  fake, but I'm not making it up

[01-Jul-18 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If you reverse engineer a a Porsche, you're still not going to get a steam driven train to be like a Porsche

[01-Jul-18 09:53 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
seen some crazy hot rods actually !

[01-Jul-18 09:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It hashes just like a z9!

j.. just slower

[01-Jul-18 09:53 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
asics modified enough to beat asic resistance ultimately will become GPU equivalents

[01-Jul-18 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"seen some crazy hot rods actually !" yes and non of them have stock motors (or in this case chips)

[01-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ethlargmentpills came out of nowhere

[01-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
software yielding + 33% hashrate

[01-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
same hardware

[01-Jul-18 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If you could increase a 1050TI chips by 30x, Don't you think NV would have done so already? ü§î

[01-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe I‚Äôm a fucking idiot and this investment is shit

[01-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm a gambler fuck it

[01-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
dont buy ASICS for equihash IMO

[01-Jul-18 09:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"dont buy ASICS for equihash IMO"
Said no one that wants to turn a profit, ever

[01-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
nobody is going to sell you a money machine for less than the amount they stand to make with it themselves

[01-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sell shovels

[01-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Guaranteed return

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you're likely to pay more for z9's than you'll recoupe anytime soon, especially without big price bump in crypto market

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not that I dont expect that

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ü§û

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but the potential for equihash to get forked

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
which a lot of coins have announced they now plan to

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"you're likely to pay more for z9's than you'll recoupe anytime soon, especially without big price bump in crypto market"
Are you heavily invested in GPUs or just like to spread FUD?

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
z9 is a chancy investment

[01-Jul-18 09:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
equihash coins are forking

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
why would i want and equihash asic ??

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
are you heavily involved in asics sounds more like the question at hand

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Profitability stands at $16/day per z9 last time I checked

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
KMD isn't and this is a KMD channel

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
equihash is KMD algo

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fluctuates of course

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> kmd isnt forking nore is zcash
