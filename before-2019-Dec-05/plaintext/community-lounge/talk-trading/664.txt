[20-May-19 03:27 AM] LocoMB#8593

[20-May-19 03:27 AM] LocoMB#8593

[20-May-19 03:28 AM] LocoMB#8593

[20-May-19 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

KMD at 100$ would actually change my life

[20-May-19 03:58 AM] Caglio#3337
at 25$ would make me really happy

[20-May-19 03:58 AM] Caglio#3337
at 4.something would probably give me back my money ( :

[20-May-19 03:58 AM] Caglio#3337
At 0 would make me drink even more and kill that liver finally üò¶

[20-May-19 04:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD At $100 is meh

[20-May-19 04:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
