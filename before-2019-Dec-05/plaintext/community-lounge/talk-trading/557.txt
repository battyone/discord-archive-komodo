[17-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Keppie#5156
Then why did he sell in the first place ?

[17-Apr-19 01:47 PM] klein#5233
that would be silly

[17-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Keppie#5156
Depends on the deal

[17-Apr-19 01:48 PM] klein#5233
unless a decent discount

[17-Apr-19 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not silly if he sold at a premium

[17-Apr-19 01:48 PM] klein#5233
more than 10%?

[17-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Keppie#5156
You cant buy 50btc worth on the exchange

[17-Apr-19 01:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it could have lost a bit or whatever, but it might help trigger the next move up which would be a win win anyway.

[17-Apr-19 01:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no?

[17-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Keppie#5156
It might yea

[17-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Keppie#5156
Overall a good thing. Back on the CT radar now üòÑ

[17-Apr-19 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it could have been more of a favor.

[17-Apr-19 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[17-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Tek#5253
am I being a good dash boi? üòÑ seems like you pay attention to it now

[17-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Tek#5253
funny thing about that sms text thing

[17-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Tek#5253
in venezuela when the power went out they could not make bitcoin transactions

[17-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Tek#5253
cause no internet

[17-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Tek#5253
but they could make dash payments over sms

[17-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So what you generate the tx locally and use an SMS relay to broadcast tx?

[17-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or third party controls your dash?

[17-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Tek#5253
dunno , dash kept working , other crypto payments didn't work anymore

[17-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Tek#5253
or not as easily

[17-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
oh man, i went out for a while and come back to a bounce, maybe time to celebrate perfect buy üòÑ

[17-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[17-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[17-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Good satphone is about the cost of an iphone

[17-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

A survey about privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies: https://t.co/fudaJhBKpL

Should be interesting to see what people say! (Obviously the survey won't represent a random sample, and won't be resistant to Sybil attacks, but that doesn't make the data useless.) https://t.co/...
