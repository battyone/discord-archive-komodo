Regarding decred it’s because their proof of stake mechanism would be considered gambling in the US

Decred - Autonomous Digital Currency
Decred is an autonomous digital currency. With a hybrid consensus system, it is built to be a decentralized, sustainable, and self-ruling currency where stakeholders make the rules.

“Unlike PoW, Proof-of-stake voting (PoS) requires little computing resources. Decred funds are used to purchase voting tickets on the network. In every block, five tickets from the pool of live tickets are chosen at random to vote on the validity of the previous block.”

It is when you sold all your crypto before binance went down :abusedsmily: 
Got so used to the stable prices, didnt seem possible that it would pump that much, hopefully it falls all the way back to where it was :troll:

[17-May-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
seem my prediction yesterday was pretty spot on. unfortunately, now the pattern is broken, there is no easy predictions anymore. i guess normal TA will drive things until the whales decide to override

[17-May-19 06:19 AM] designer#4893
In cryptoworld, charts are pointless. In fact, the same is true of the stock market.

It seems btc bull is getting a bit tired. the last jump up from the green line was very small. first time it was so small and short lived since the recent pattern started. http://159.69.45.70:8050/
I think this could mean that the whale pushes might be taking a break for now and normal TA might apply. how much it will correct... no clear idea, just guessing maybe to the low $7000 level?

when a single trader can change the entire mood of the market, statistical analysis (which is what TA is) cannot be reliable

[17-May-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but in crypto most traders are using TA, which explains why fundamentals dont seem to matter

I find it very hard to believe that the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF any time soon given that their primary worry has always been manipulation of prices and Bitcoin's price was just brought down by a handful of actors by 20% in a matter of minutes.
