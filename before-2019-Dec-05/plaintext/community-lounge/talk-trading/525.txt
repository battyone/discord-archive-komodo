I could, just didn't made sense to me since I was looking for something in the middle of most simple, basic and somewhat modern.
C kinda fits that.

[09-Apr-19 04:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in latest modern languages learned Go, loving it.
now need to grasp some old and yet light/simple one, so, that's C.

idea is being able to import CryptoConditions CC code written in C by James, in my Go language code.

[09-Apr-19 04:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
to do that I first need to understand the C language

[09-Apr-19 04:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
moving from JavaScript based languages to these core native languages has slowed me down a lot.

[09-Apr-19 09:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
this just looks like autogenerated code from an IDE or some other project

all of this code is very rudimentary stuff, and yes, we need to see the actual full node open sourced for them to get any credibility back

[09-Apr-19 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have seen this kind of thing endless times with big corporations and open source

[09-Apr-19 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
They get called out for not actually being open source, so then they go look for the most useless thing to open source, to get marketing buzz back

[09-Apr-19 10:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
VMware does this exact kind of thing

[09-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
so much dicking around when it comes to bitcoin....bears push it down 100$ then its like they go back to sleep and bulls have a free way to push it back up

[09-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So what you‚Äôre saying is VBK is so advanced, it looks rudimentary, like a fundamental paradigm shift you‚Äôre incapable of perceiving? @dukeleto
