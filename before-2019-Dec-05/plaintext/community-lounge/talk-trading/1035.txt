@Markus  PHBA2061Today at 3:13 PM
on consensus level, I believe both Tezos & Lisk have DPoS , instead of PoW

[07-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I said that ARK also have DPOS

[07-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I know what KMD has lol

[07-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[07-Aug-19 02:18 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yeah but thats not the reason for good performance

[07-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Coin girl, buy more kmd

[07-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Good stable investment

[07-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Top 10 coin easily

[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] altcoinist#1501
It's simple there are more sellers than buyers and no demand

[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yep and the bots push the price down

[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
like no one cares about KMD.

[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
fine we heard it for 2 weeks now that kmd dump

[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
are we gonna continue same talk forever?

[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
im sure we know by now

[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
Do you really ?

[07-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
Or you think we are having a support on 7032 ?

[07-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
idc where support is....i will be buying when ppl sell and panic

[07-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
True, this is not a good moment to buy yet

[07-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
obviously even you know we are going lower

[07-Aug-19 02:20 PM] coingirl87#6489
I only want to know why tezos and lisk not dump because they are not better than kmd

[07-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
but ppl clearly started to panic considering we dropped from 10k to 7k quite fast

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] altcoinist#1501
What are we gonna do today? Same thing every day complaining about the kmd marketing and price!

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
I know what are we not gonna do today

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
Buy more shitcoin

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] debaas#3337
there was a 3 month period where people have bought KMD between 60-90 cents. so more dumps could still happen

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yep.

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
We are going back to that

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
we started with 0.50

[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
we are going down to 0.40

[07-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
next time when bear market happens

[07-Aug-19 02:22 PM] coingirl87#6489
We have to analyze why there is no demand for kmd and react

{Reactions}

[07-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
we are capitulating

[07-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Caglio#3337
In the end it will be amazing if komodo is just a scam

[07-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Caglio#3337
No marketing, cos we have nothing to market about

[07-Aug-19 02:23 PM] altcoinist#1501
or somone deliberately dumps kmd to create panic ðŸ¤”

[07-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
the best thing that happened here was 1) agama hack

[07-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
where we got hacked by devs, and money is made back

[07-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
All promises, since monaize went to dust

[07-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Marketing, and rebranding... pure joke

[07-Aug-19 02:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
marketing != shilling

[07-Aug-19 02:26 PM] altcoinist#1501
shilling =awareness

[07-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Caglio you have a point .

[07-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and you have made it

[07-Aug-19 02:26 PM] PHBA2061#2530
there are companies who are interested in Antara, that's the proof of marketing

@PHBA2061 who?

[07-Aug-19 02:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
tezos has wall st investors. lisk was not going to be unavailable thru binance post usa shutdown but there are rumors that they will be on binance's usa replacement exchange.

[07-Aug-19 02:27 PM] altcoinist#1501
At least XRP stayed at top 3:troll_king:

[07-Aug-19 02:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
idk, it's under NDA as the team said, supposed it is true

[07-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Markus#5464
@altcoinist cause no dumpers, 85% of supply held by XRP team

[07-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Markus#5464
rest being hodlers hoping for moon

[07-Aug-19 02:30 PM] dan.#2473
crazy how well litecoin is holding up

[07-Aug-19 02:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
everyone else is getting epicly rekt too. picking on kmd is just personal malice

[07-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Caglio#3337
@dan. its a good coin, however people shit on it, it has marketing and use, unlike many others

[07-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Markus#5464

[07-Aug-19 02:32 PM] dan.#2473
@Caglio i suppose it might have to do with network effect just like bitcoin, when btc fees get insane litecoin tends to be used

[07-Aug-19 02:33 PM] Markus#5464
so this is how top alts and kmd added to compare performance since btc started to rally this year

[07-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Markus#5464
this is the chart

[07-Aug-19 02:35 PM] Markus#5464
so its not kmd itself

[07-Aug-19 02:35 PM] Markus#5464
chill ðŸ˜„

[07-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Flint#6435
all this news and partnership does not affect the price! while the market is easy to manipulate while capitalization and trading volumes are low!

[07-Aug-19 02:37 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@Markus thanks for those graphs, puts it all in perspective

[07-Aug-19 02:37 PM] coingirl87#6489
But kmd is top 5 of loosers although they have amazing tech...how this is possible? We came from rank 40 of cmc

[07-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Markus#5464
we will go back when alts start to recover

[07-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Flint#6435
people are scared away from investments by the fact that their asset can lose 60% in a month! that's enough for them! and as the price movement shows - there are very few true holders - mostly weak hands in the hope of flying to the moon - no more! but they easily get rid of in a panic everything that shows such a red picture on the chart!!!

[07-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Markus#5464
if u believe in kmd start loading up

[07-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Markus#5464
buy now and then not all at once

[07-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Markus#5464
this is a clear sign that something will happen sooner or later

[07-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Markus#5464
if all alts get rekt

[07-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Markus#5464
its just matter of time when it changes

[07-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Flint#6435
and what is the reason for the recovery of altcoins? why do investors with big money suddenly want to invest in altcoins instead of bitcoin?

[07-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Markus#5464
cause their profits with btc are limited
