I have no way of moving my coins I'm in Mexico on a business trip....

[05-Jun-19 01:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
At least not until I get back to my hotel room...

[05-Jun-19 01:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
NVM my wallet was swept to the community address..

[05-Jun-19 01:44 PM] Tek#5253
really wondering why wallet wasn't swept

[05-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Keppie#5156
You mean your wallet @Tek?

[05-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
yes

[05-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
I used the seed a week ago

[05-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Tek#5253
i sent to binance

[05-Jun-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
we were not able to get 100% of all compromised addresses, this is why we say to move them to a secure address

[05-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Tek#5253
oh ok

[05-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Malti#3948
I'm just wondering, with Discord ID + then the address, coins and txid, how will you know that people are honest?

[05-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Malti#3948
it's all open info

[05-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Malti#3948
except for discord ID

[05-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Malti#3948
but I guess there are agama users without discord as well

[05-Jun-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
we have our secret methods, but cannot reveal them

[05-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Malti#3948
ok

[05-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Malti#3948
understandable

[05-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Is there a way to test my public key and see if it is safe?

[05-Jun-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the only way to be sure is to move it to a known secure address, or if it was swept or stolen then you can know it wasnt safe

[05-Jun-19 01:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yeah I was swept

[05-Jun-19 01:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Is only one vulnerable or are my assets vulnerable as well vsc supernet bet

[05-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Malti#3948
for the sleepless nights, I can send some funny white stuff to keep you going.. I accept ARRR as payment :realpirate:

[05-Jun-19 01:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Is only kmd vulnerable?

[05-Jun-19 01:58 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
No. All assetchains or any seed /wif/passphrase made in agama

[05-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Malti#3948
@BlackJesus if you had other funds on that public key, then those funds will also be affected

[05-Jun-19 01:58 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
In the last 6 months

[05-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
My problem is I only ever used native and the QT wallet is loading up the wallet data file. Sadly only have access to the one computer.

[05-Jun-19 01:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Rename the wallet.dat file to something else and keep it safe

[05-Jun-19 01:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Create a new one with qt

[05-Jun-19 01:59 PM] 차미숙#8912

with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.

[05-Jun-19 02:28 PM] 차미숙#8912
Damn I left 5KMD on my wallet to see if my wallet was vulnerable. Seems it got whitehacked by safu

[05-Jun-19 02:28 PM] 차미숙#8912
What a day

[05-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Malti#3948
As I'm hodling KMD for the long run, I would agree to leave my funds in a KMD team controlled wallet for x amount of time to give them control over the 5% rewards and allocate those rewards to people who got wiped..

com'on peepz, let's get this in the works with a nice plan and cover our community together :Komodo:

[05-Jun-19 02:36 PM] 차미숙#8912
Yeah I mean I would totally support that

[05-Jun-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All I'm worried about is how we tell who's coins are who's?

[05-Jun-19 02:37 PM] 차미숙#8912
Don't have much in the safu thougj

[05-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Alecandro#1179
@jl777c you’re an incredible person for doing that for the community

[05-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
solid proposition by @Malti

[05-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Malti#3948
the funds are swept, they have secret method to allocate funds to right people. There are def ways to get this to work

[05-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea not a bad idea at all. We can also do donations maybe? Idk!

[05-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Duck Tape#9059
I wouldn't mind donating my rewards

[05-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
If that's the case can I just send my coins to the whitehat address for safe keeping during this time which can also help with the rewards?

[05-Jun-19 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't send coins to the whiehat address 😂  those are yours

[05-Jun-19 02:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
another idea, is KMD can provide a donation address and miners can donate some hashpower and mine to that address

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Malti#3948
let's let the team think about how to work this out, could be a change on veruswallet where you can turn on the automatic send of rewards to a donation address or what not

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Malti#3948
seeing the reaction of the team, the hours spent I don't feel they have to cover all the costs again. We are a community in early adoption and should take care of one another

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Malti#3948
i feel like a communist tho lol

[05-Jun-19 02:41 PM] 차미숙#8912
Once the wallet gets stabilized, i will send some rewards to the donation wallet
