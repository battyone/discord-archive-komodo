and it may be a bigger bear not related to crypto itself / outside condition

[17-Jul-18 08:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Meh

[17-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As long as central banks keep printing

Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece ready to bankrupt, just need initiation

Add france to it .. yes .. france

[17-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Bowdo#4054
Decent little pump by the looks

[17-Jul-18 11:35 PM] bishop#9773
Tradingview, add 20 period simple moving average, change time period to weekly @cascrypto

[18-Jul-18 01:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So what you‚Äôre saying is be balls deep in alts all the time

[18-Jul-18 02:39 AM] Hegelian#0018
Is bdex the only real atomic swaps in crypto?

[18-Jul-18 02:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Decred has done a couple and blocknet,  but we are the most advanced and have done the most swaps

@polycryptoblog and the best looking üòõ

[18-Jul-18 03:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
But of course üòé

[18-Jul-18 03:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Still not a bull market

[18-Jul-18 03:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We will probably dump back to 6k by the end of the week, dont get too excited LOL

[18-Jul-18 03:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I know lol

[18-Jul-18 03:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm still BTC to 2-3k

[18-Jul-18 03:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But i will get a few more boxes of ramen to last me a few more months üòõ

[18-Jul-18 03:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah i dont think 2-3k is anywhere close to the bottom

[18-Jul-18 03:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just under 5k i suspect might be the low unless something big happens. Plus if it has not happened up till now, i dont think it will happen. Too much global stability issues and mining costs need to be factored in.

[18-Jul-18 03:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But then again we are in a smaller market than gold and silver.......and that is being manipulated up and down all day everyday

[18-Jul-18 03:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Futures = volatility as people can move markets to make sure they get paid

[18-Jul-18 04:12 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I think the next big catalyst will be the american bankruptcy. I think it'll happen by 2030

[18-Jul-18 04:13 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Interest on the debt is about to pass our GDP which is basically being in default.

[18-Jul-18 04:14 AM] BlackJesus#6161
interest growth is going to surpass the amount we can even pay...

[18-Jul-18 04:14 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It's like having a loan out that generates 1k a month in interest but you only make 700 bucks a month... And you still gotta live...

[18-Jul-18 06:42 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Those numbers don't seem right üëÄ

[18-Jul-18 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
USA won't last the decade out. But there is plenty of head room for more money printing, if the US prints as much as Japan has in the last decade they can still print another 12 trillion USD without too much problems of hyper inflation, I think the main problem is if countries like China start selling US debt back to the fed or US commercial banks. Then all that USD comes home and the world might be in some general trouble.

[18-Jul-18 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In that scenario crypto will likely fall along with everything else, but will eventually be the winner.

[18-Jul-18 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As people need a medium of exchange and so far this is the only real alternative digital currency

[18-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont forget the SEC will decide on bitcoin ETF on august 10th

[18-Jul-18 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Fuck if I know

[18-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thought they were going to be returning the bitcoin instead of USD equivalent

[18-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Facts aren‚Äôt important

[18-Jul-18 08:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Load ze FUD

[18-Jul-18 09:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Nope returning the usd equivalent

[18-Jul-18 09:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[18-Jul-18 10:02 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Given ardor pump, crypto still needs to learn logic @Hollowman9000

[18-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Trust in the randomness of the bull

[18-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
Do you know why it pumped?

[18-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, binance listing

[18-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Bittersweet#9376
That explains 50% gains right :trollface:

[18-Jul-18 11:40 AM] Bowdo#4054
Sure.  Because reasons!

[18-Jul-18 11:43 AM] LocoMB#8593
I keep peeking in to the ARDR slack occasionally- quite the echo chamber there, and NXTforum is a ghost town with like .. 0-5 posts per _day_ .. bhuut .. pumph manny..

[18-Jul-18 11:51 AM] Bowdo#4054
Got to admit, I know stuff all about Ardor.  Does it have promise?

[18-Jul-18 12:16 PM] Bittersweet#9376
ardr since the whole ignis/ardr/nxt debacle is a scam in my eyes, I got banned from their slack for telling them they were scamming people with the whole p/n airdrop thing

what does our security officer say about that?

[18-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who is the security officer

[18-Jul-18 12:52 PM] cascrypto#8206
@ca333

[18-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who are the KMD superwhales

[18-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What are their plans

[18-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are they in it for the long haul or will they decapitate the market

[18-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I would expect the smart super whales have sold off a portion of their coins during the December bull run to recoup their initial investment with a sizable profit and are now just holding for interest gains.

[18-Jul-18 01:44 PM] JimD#9272
When do we hit 1000?

[18-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Better get a move on

[18-Jul-18 01:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
KMD superwhale plans are to live off 5%

[18-Jul-18 01:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
IMO

[18-Jul-18 01:53 PM] ca333#0118
@cascrypto say about what? 
@Hollowman9000 what do you mean by "dpow scam" ?

[18-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dumping about 12k KMD per day ought to do it

[18-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ca333 parody of the summation from nxter magazine

[18-Jul-18 01:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
that article was already discussed at the time of publication, I remember jl having a chat with the author in Slack

[18-Jul-18 01:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
or some other media

[18-Jul-18 01:55 PM] ca333#0118
i see. i wasnt involved in that talk so couldnt judge/provide any info

[18-Jul-18 01:57 PM] ca333#0118
@cascrypto thats a misunderstanding. i am not the security officer - maj. opsec/devsec is handled externally

Is Blocnation not happy with KMD?

[18-Jul-18 04:10 PM] tolken#2655
Just seems like they‚Äôre trying to cope with their lackluster ICO. ‚ÄúExploring all options, including platforms‚Äù

[18-Jul-18 04:11 PM] tolken#2655
I mean, any independent company should always be exploring all options, but to make a point to state it as such, seems like more to it than that.

[18-Jul-18 04:15 PM] tolken#2655
Seems like their dICO was a bit rough to start.

[18-Jul-18 04:20 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I read in other channels that for the bear market the amount raised is now below what they need, so they're refunding

[18-Jul-18 04:29 PM] tolken#2655
Yea, read that - cool move by them. Hope hey do well in the end.

[18-Jul-18 04:29 PM] tolken#2655
Just hope there‚Äôs no bad blood between them and kmd, they seemed like a great partner.

[18-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Mische#6695
they seemed arrogant to me üòÉ

[18-Jul-18 04:30 PM] tolken#2655
Yeah? Well I just mean the concept and tech. Didn‚Äôt interact with the team much.

[18-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They didn‚Äôt seem to make much noise with it
