im so torn on whether to put my money into KMD or ARRRR

[23-May-19 02:39 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
kmd is gonna moon as soon as the new rebrand and product line are announced

[23-May-19 02:39 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and its a more broad-stroke bet

[23-May-19 02:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Split it in a reasonable way

Easiest way for me to buy some ARRR if I don't have an account on any exchange its offered on?

[23-May-19 02:57 AM] Alecandro#1179
Only on digitalprice?

[23-May-19 02:58 AM] Regnar#6164
You could try https://app.barterlly.io

[23-May-19 02:58 AM] bishop#9773
Why do people keep saying this rebrand is going to overnight change things... it's a process...

Can you store ARRR in the Agama wallet?

[23-May-19 02:58 AM] Regnar#6164
It's in Beta and is a new community project that is doing Automated escrow services. I'm not sure how much ARRR is available but you can put an order request up and see if someone fills it

[23-May-19 02:59 AM] Regnar#6164
Yes, ARRR runs only in Native mode though, so you have to sync the chain and can't run Native and Lite modes at the same time

[23-May-19 03:00 AM] Alecandro#1179
ahhh okay so better off getting the wallet then

[23-May-19 03:00 AM] Regnar#6164
?

[23-May-19 03:00 AM] Alecandro#1179
Pirate Ocean?

[23-May-19 03:00 AM] Alecandro#1179
Sorry haha

[23-May-19 03:00 AM] Regnar#6164
ohh yea

[23-May-19 03:00 AM] Regnar#6164
PirateOcean is another wallet that can store ARRR

[23-May-19 03:00 AM] Regnar#6164
You can also run CLI (what I use) though that has no GUI

[23-May-19 03:01 AM] Alecandro#1179
gocha

[23-May-19 03:02 AM] Regnar#6164
After you get a wallet, you can try Barterlly, or one of the exchanges here <https://coinpaprika.com/coin/arrr-pirate/#!exchanges>

Not sure if this works still since new options have come out, but back when Pirate just started people used this to get some easily. <https://dexstats.info/onboarding.php> I think @CHMEX runs it

[23-May-19 03:06 AM] CHMEX#0686
It still works you also get referral commission

but not much volume as mm1 is being replaced by mm2 currently

[23-May-19 08:46 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@johnwhitestar BarterDEX v1 is deprecated and not much market, all effort is on v2

[23-May-19 08:47 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
@CryptoNinjaa how can I see the volumes for each coin and whether there are orders and for which pairs?

[23-May-19 08:48 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
@KomodoWorld and where can I get info about v2 market?

[23-May-19 08:49 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
there's an alpha in closed testing, the development repo is here:  https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/tree/008ba6283a58393dccb23d1adab2301fb6a020f9 for questions ask in #dev-marketmaker

@KomodoWorld I'm a trader, trying to switch to a Dex, as I'm sick of losing money on CEXs. So what you are saying does it mean that there is no place to trade at the moment?

[23-May-19 08:52 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
sorry, currently there's no practical way to trade via BarterDEX, you should check again in  a few months. v2 is a vast improvement on v1 on all aspects

[23-May-19 08:53 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
and the info I mentioned previously has to do with v1, which is still active, right?

[23-May-19 08:54 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes, but not sure if there are nodes active now

[23-May-19 08:55 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
what would be the best strategy for me to get notice soon after v2 is released?

[23-May-19 08:57 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
follow  Komodo on twitter, reddit or subscribe the newsletter. It will be announced. Tere will be an open beta before a full release

[23-May-19 08:57 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
so I'll see the announcement here as well?

[23-May-19 08:57 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes of course

[23-May-19 08:57 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
(I mean in # official channel)

[23-May-19 08:58 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes it will be an important announcement

[23-May-19 08:59 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
Thank you very much!

[23-May-19 09:04 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
It will be historic when MM2 platforms are released üöÄ

[23-May-19 09:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you follow KMD you wont miss it @johnwhitestar - And all the free marketing hacked and compromised CEX's give BarterDEX will remind you too.

[23-May-19 09:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As @jl777c said, even with an unlimited budget, Komodo couldn't have purchased the kind of marketing BarterDEX has been getting lately in regards to CEXs being a problem.

[23-May-19 09:38 AM] johnwhitestar#1227

[23-May-19 09:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
yes I have them

[23-May-19 09:44 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Rfox is dependant on Benny, so maybe ask him or wait for news on that one

[23-May-19 09:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So if I migrate or w/e I will have zexo and rfox?

[23-May-19 09:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
ok thanks

[23-May-19 09:45 AM] FishyGuts#5085
