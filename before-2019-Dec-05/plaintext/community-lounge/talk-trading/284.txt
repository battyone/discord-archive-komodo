doesnt matter how many users of BCH there is

[17-Nov-18 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`well, the central exchanges will be determining the winner of this`
That's kinda a given with any divergence

[17-Nov-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
or even hashrate/miners

[17-Nov-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is whoever can convince binance or whatever other exchange all the other exchanges will follow

[17-Nov-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so having centralized exchanges centrally deciding things doesnt seem very decentralized
doesnt matter how many users of BCH there is`
Well, that's exactly what happened with BTC, when Cb declared that the consensus fork would be a "new coin" even if it had the hashpower

[17-Nov-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is the way things work. yet it isnt decentralized

The funny (ironic) part of BTC fork was that the media "claim of victory" was that the "2X" didn't forge ahead anyway (as if there was any reason to when it would never be financially viable)

[17-Nov-18 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Bittrex didn't make a public declaration, at the time, but richie says that as far as he's concerned whomever holds the commit key to the `https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin` repo is the decider of what bitcoin is/isn't

[17-Nov-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure about his thoughts on BCH

[17-Nov-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`this a unpopularity contest` that's been the landscape for a year now (BTC and anti-Bitmain is a perfect example)

[17-Nov-18 04:38 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Those two are fighting over who gets to drop the last syllables in their name so they can retain the true BCH title. That's all this is and yet it will destroy the market rank of the coin to allow others to take it spot.

[17-Nov-18 04:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the Ethereum fork back in 2016 was without replay protection at first right (the protection was later added onto Ethereum) ? Despite both chain still exist today,  Ethereum ecosystem is a lot more diverse than Ethereum Classic, so in the end what matters is the community choice, rather than who has more hashpower , imo ?

[17-Nov-18 04:41 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I think people underestimate ETC. Still feel like with some time it could very well catch up to ETH in marketcap.

That is true, if market was rational then KMD wouldn't be setting at 90 cents.

none of this would be happening without the assurance that their BTC would be safe after initial BCH split
too much credit is given to these idiots when they took no risk in reality
not how real world works
now if the Dr. is Satoshi and proves BTC is ⚰  due to Core changes, i'll take everything back and will concede

crypto reserve coin can be floppy
don't underestimate the existing use-case for BTC
maybe it will never be cash (i know that was the plan), but it's already something really important on the trading side of things

yes, options are good
it all comes down to liquidity for this specific use-case
i'm just saying BTC is King for this and can continue being so even if floppy

let Btc do its store of value thing and become world reserve in place of gold, then assetize it on Komodo to actually spend it :trollface:

[17-Nov-18 05:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, ETH might have more liquidity, but you can't buy/sell all coins against it (on CEXs)

[17-Nov-18 05:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'm surprised no one has told me to walk the plank yet 😂

[17-Nov-18 05:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
True, not as much trading pairs as btc

[17-Nov-18 05:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
it could definitely happen where some other crypto fills the role in the future (no need with swaps), but it will take a long time
look, as long as CEXs make more from commissions than costs to add pairs, it can/will

hope this doesn't put me on the plank...but here is my 2 cent - It will be unique features (proprietary/patented) alongside opensource code that competes for usability in the currency market....that usability is what will win....BTC as a crytpo reserve works well as it allows other currencies to peg to it for security and value (a la dPOW or a tether coin)...but I think the original BTC folks are a bit pissed that BTC is more and more relegated to a reserver currency while other pegged currencies get all the fame and action.  RV/CSW are in this boat...how to make BTC be the day to day currency...they neither one wanted the BCH fork but they were 'stabbed' in the back by Jihan/bitmain splitting BTC in the first place.  To sum this up:  1.  Jihan at Bitmain wants 1000's of alts so they can sell equipment....2.  RV wants development...3.  CSW wants the old BTC vision.    They all win with the centralization of money...as they all get richer.  I can see all perspectives...which is needed by humanity now?  I think #2 and #3 are still in the best interests of humanity...but Jihan is just another capitalist corporation imo.  With all of that said...where does that leave the alts?  In the long run they will compete with BCH(by whatever name) and evolve into the transactional  winner.  I personally think that will be KMD or ZEN (maybe ETH)...but they better get some patented stuff in the mix or the next 'new' open sourced solution di jour will vacuum up their ideas and win competitively...the ecosystem is the key differentiator.  So keep up the good work devs and let's change the world while the old folks keep debating who has the biggest peni$ while doing the scrooge mcduck swim in their piles of gold.

So in this one.....the one I was trying to just post a screenshot of.  Someone argues that the devs in pirate can just make as many coins as they want and nobody will know the difference and you just have to trust the devs.  Anyone have a counter for this argument?

[18-Nov-18 12:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The beauty of open source code is that you can look at it and see what it is going to do

[18-Nov-18 12:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
You cant make as many coins as you want, they have to be mined. There was no premine.

[18-Nov-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
@ryman112 the same argument can be made about any zkSNARKs coin

[18-Nov-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
completely illogical that a BTCP fan boy would argue that

[18-Nov-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
it's the same FUD zcash has had since it's inception

[18-Nov-18 12:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@actionslacks  the fudder is trying to imply there is a trapdoor

[18-Nov-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
`he problem is the founders of any zksnark coin (zclassic, zcash, btcp, pirate, etc) can generate an infinite number of coins in an undetected way. So you have to "trust" they're not doing that.`
This is just false. If all of the people in the original zcash parameter ceremony kept the "toxic waste", they'd be able to print coins on any coin using the parameters(any coin using zkSNARKs atm)

[18-Nov-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
so technically, yes zcash devs could print coins on any of these chains if they all colluded and did not destroy the "toxic waste"

[18-Nov-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
only one person had to destroy their share of the toxic waste though

[18-Nov-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
btcp dev or pirate dev would not be able to do it though

[18-Nov-18 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
they're a XMR shill parroting the same 2 year old FUD

[18-Nov-18 04:08 AM] ryman112#0068

*Coin Dance is now able to declare that both active chains will continue to be permanently split into the foreseeable future. The majority of businesses in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are now using Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to refer to the chain maintained by miners operating in consensus with the latest implementations from Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitprim, Bitcoin XT, bcash, and bchd. A number of exchanges have added support for the Bitcoin SV chain under the Bitcoin SV (BSV / BCHSV) name but general app support is currently very limited. Expect to see announcements made from each of the major companies in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem that clarify which chain(s) they will support going forward.*
*The Bitcoin SV community believes that dedicated hash is the key mechanism used for building network consensus. The Bitcoin Cash community believes that that miners, developers, businesses, and individuals should all have a voice on future protocol changes. Over time, we will see which of these two viewpoints ends up getting us closer to that dream of building digital cash for the entire world.*

[18-Nov-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
The moment the BCH chain split, it was clear that both chains would survive

otherwise having both chains living.... is very bad for both chains.

[18-Nov-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
checkpoint separates the blockchains, but so do the different consensus rule sets

[18-Nov-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so ABC cant be reorged past the checkpoint
