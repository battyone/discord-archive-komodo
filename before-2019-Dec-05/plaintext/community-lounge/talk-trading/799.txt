You can try to ride the waves

Until a rogue wave shows up and it instapumps to 100k sats

Rogue waves are awesome and metaphorically, you can think of them as a massive trend change that is statistically improbable but not impossible: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave`  . They also sink container ships like a hot knife thru butter

[21-Jun-19 03:45 PM] jansako#3330
statistically improbably to me means... it WILL happen, sooner or later... relates to both water & crypto üòÉ

sure, if those fuckers can snatch a plane flying at a few thousand feet up... maybe as one of the causes?

[21-Jun-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
planes are methane gas?

[21-Jun-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean the planes crashing from methane gas, boats sinking from rogue waves

[21-Jun-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
or aliens

[21-Jun-19 03:49 PM] jansako#3330
or methane breathing aliens...:-)

[21-Jun-19 03:50 PM] jansako#3330
did not know methane gas can stick together in a 'bubble' so when the plane flies into it... boom! (no idea, is that for real?)

[21-Jun-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw some documentary about it, no idea how big the gas bubble can be, i think the planes cant be too high up

[21-Jun-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt explode, the aerodynamics of plane doesnt work so good in methane, or so it said

[21-Jun-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is just a crazy theory

[21-Jun-19 03:53 PM] jansako#3330
hmm... not thick enough to explode but what? makes the plane drop out of the sky? Sounds fishy, planes often drop dozens of feet in turbulence and they are OK... except peoples lunches all come up...

```A typical fart is composed of about 59 percent nitrogen, 21 percent hydrogen, 9 percent carbon dioxide, 7 percent methane and 4 percent oxygen. Only about one percent of a fart contains hydrogen sulfide gas and mercaptans, which contain sulfur, and the sulfur is what makes farts stink.
```
Moral: if near Bermuda Triangle, don't fart.

yep, like nothing happened

[21-Jun-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if it can stabilize above 10k, i think that could be the new floor for the bull

[21-Jun-19 04:11 PM] Malti#3948
I missed @Hollowman9000

Stabilize above 10k...muh heart

[21-Jun-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
we need a little spike up to 11k or a bit less

[21-Jun-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
then it could maintain about 10k. though there are some desperate to keep it below 10k as we saw that 3000btc sell

I honestly didnt think we'd be back to 10k this fast lmao

Back in march

[21-Jun-19 04:30 PM] Flexatron#8809
Did think it was the  bottom tho

[21-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or KMD could hit a rogue hole and crash to 176 sats again

[21-Jun-19 04:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

incase of flash crash

[21-Jun-19 04:35 PM] Caglio#3337
lool

[21-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Markus#5464
and why would it flash crash

[21-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Tek#5253
happens all the time

[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Tek#5253
many alts flash crashed lately

[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Tek#5253
this bear

[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Tek#5253
last bear *

[21-Jun-19 04:38 PM] Tek#5253
ETH flash crashed to 10 cents in the past too

[21-Jun-19 04:38 PM] Markus#5464
it just have to be missclick mistakes, nobody is stupid enough to dump on purpose to give ppl cheap coins and lose on it themselves unless rly stupid

[21-Jun-19 04:38 PM] Tek#5253
no its not misclicks, its caused by bots and stop loss / stop buy /

[21-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Tek#5253
if you have very low liquidity in the buy order book and a lot of stop loss orders go off

[21-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Tek#5253
it can crash very low

[21-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Tek#5253
stop loss order = sell everything when it hits this price

[21-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Tek#5253
market sell *

[21-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Markus#5464
so u mean 500k market sell on Waves recently was a stoploss....highly wouldnt

[21-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Tek#5253
yes

[21-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Tek#5253
someone did a market sell then it crashed even worse cause many stop loss orders hit

[21-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Markus#5464
someone with 500k would be smarter then having a stoploss with 500k that will dump price to 1 sat

[21-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Tek#5253
uh you don't understand, nevermind

[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
i do understand

[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
but to trigger a domino effect of stop losses u would need a rly large amount of coins in the first place

[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
and u would in the end be the loosing one cause bots will buy it back up instantly anyway

[21-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Tek#5253
you can market sell and cause 10%dip with your stack, but the stop losses take it to -60%

[21-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Tek#5253
ify ou have a big stack

[21-Jun-19 04:42 PM] LocoMB#8593
umm.. $10k is a really tough resistance for BTC

[21-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Tek#5253
good

[21-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Tek#5253
hope alts moon for a bit

[21-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Tek#5253
10k was when it came on national television on the news here

[21-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Tek#5253
last time

[21-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Markus#5464
it have gone up around 30% without a pullback so its not very strange that u will face some resistance sooner or later

[21-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Tek#5253
come one ETH now is your chance

[21-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The 176 sat dump was during some initial network problems or hack ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù

[21-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I forget what it was

[21-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dumper nekked himself when KMD topped $10

[21-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$0.002161 was the fiat equivalent of the dump at the time

[21-Jun-19 04:55 PM] Caglio#3337
whole 10$?

[21-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dec 21, 2017 KMD peaked at $15.41

[21-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
89659 sats at that time

[21-Jun-19 05:00 PM] Sherdogz#6731
I sold at $10 i remember it quite vividly it was in the morning a huge green dildoüòç

[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If the absolute bottom buyer held he achieved a 7130x increase at the top
