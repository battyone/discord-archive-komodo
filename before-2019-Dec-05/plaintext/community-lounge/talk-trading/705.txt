.eth usernames receive payments exactly the same as a hex address would. just so you know. there is nothing innovative or bleeding edge about anything that dash is doing so if your looking for investors you're probably in the wrong place.

[30-May-19 05:02 AM] Tek#5253
doubt it works the same

[30-May-19 05:02 AM] Tek#5253
and im not looking for investors I shill dash all the time just like I shill kmd all the time in other discords

[30-May-19 05:03 AM] Tek#5253
fact remains that dash is usable with all the features it has to securely transact instantly.

[30-May-19 05:03 AM] Tek#5253
n one is gonna use btc in the coffee shop

[30-May-19 05:04 AM] Tek#5253
you can all bullshit about muh premine muh this muh not innovate that. but dash works.

[30-May-19 05:04 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Btc is just safe haven

[30-May-19 05:04 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
That coffee phase is over

[30-May-19 05:05 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[30-May-19 05:05 AM] Alexfrog#1338
btc = gold, nothing else

[30-May-19 05:05 AM] Tek#5253
venezuela has a whole new economy started build on dash, bc you can pay coffee with it

[30-May-19 05:06 AM] Tek#5253
the only reason im into dash is bc i tried it and it works

[30-May-19 05:06 AM] Tek#5253
much better than the rest

[30-May-19 05:07 AM] Tek#5253
@Alright is there instant send on the kmd main chain?

[30-May-19 05:07 AM] Tek#5253
can i instant send you KMD right now?

[30-May-19 05:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
i'll i was impressed with how fast the wallet synced and how smoothly every thing worked even on my older machine but it only has to do one thing. shits cool man, we get it. this isn't a pissing contest so lets put our junk away.

[30-May-19 05:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
nobody wants to see your junk

[30-May-19 05:10 AM] Tek#5253
:troll_lol:

[30-May-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
No, it's not likely to ever be on KMD main chain, rather a KMD side chain

[30-May-19 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
KMD main chain is like an anchor for 60 other chains, best to keep it simple

[30-May-19 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
I see a lot of people and businesses using DASH and BCH,  to avoid fees on BTC

[30-May-19 05:11 AM] Tek#5253
yeah tru

[30-May-19 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
DASH has a program called DASH back, where store owners and customers each get some % back of the transaction, like 10%, which incentivizes it to be used over dirty fiat or other coins

[30-May-19 05:12 AM] Tek#5253
@dukeleto did you see memo.cash?

[30-May-19 05:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's pretty smart, and BCH copied it and does BCH Back

[30-May-19 05:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek yes

[30-May-19 05:12 AM] Tek#5253
thats pretty cool too

[30-May-19 05:12 AM] Tek#5253
good place for early news also

[30-May-19 05:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
I don't believe in DASH tech, it's old and not anywhere close to KMD tech. But DASH marketing is some of the best in the whole industry. And their bizdev

[30-May-19 05:13 AM] Tek#5253
well i believe in it more than core

[30-May-19 05:13 AM] Tek#5253
cause it actually works

[30-May-19 05:13 AM] Alright#0419
core purposefully made their coin not work

[30-May-19 05:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's useful for a low-fee medium-of-exchange

[30-May-19 05:13 AM] Alright#0419
not a good comparison

[30-May-19 05:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User do you buy "shit tickets" with your shitcoins, i.e. toilet paper?

[30-May-19 05:14 AM] Tek#5253
also the investment fund is going to be interesting

[30-May-19 05:15 AM] Tek#5253
dash will use part of the dash mined for self funding purpose to start buying companies and other investments

[30-May-19 05:15 AM] LocoMB#8593
what about the core vs cash split?
personally, I lost all faith in cash when CSW turned out to be on board

[30-May-19 05:15 AM] Tek#5253
then they will buy back dash with proftis those companies make

[30-May-19 05:15 AM] LocoMB#8593
and rightly so, coz CSW promptly tried to destroy the whole thing by going into overdrive with BSV and 1 GB blocks

[30-May-19 05:15 AM] Tek#5253
i believe in big blocks

[30-May-19 05:15 AM] Tek#5253
but I think csw is an asshole

[30-May-19 05:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
not 1 GB blocks you don't (I hope)

[30-May-19 05:16 AM] Tek#5253
actually there has already been stress tests

[30-May-19 05:16 AM] Tek#5253
and 1gb works

[30-May-19 05:16 AM] Tek#5253
but you need graphene and other ordering stuff

[30-May-19 05:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
well- I call BS to that

[30-May-19 05:16 AM] Tek#5253
let me point you to an article then

[30-May-19 05:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
not interested- 1 GB blocks are not sustainable.. pipe dream

[30-May-19 05:17 AM] Tek#5253
they are sustainable if you rewire the internet. and thats already happening cause they want to roll out 5G

[30-May-19 05:17 AM] Tek#5253
it needs fiber

[30-May-19 05:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
something like a Transrapid maglev train- on paper and in a carefully controlled lab env it looks great, but it is simply not feasible

[30-May-19 05:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
yayaya .. thanks for making my point for me: _if you rewire the internet_ ... that's why I call it BS

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] Alright#0419
you need to rewire the internet to make LN work

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜… 

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] Tek#5253
lol you haevn't seen what they do to roll out 5G? all those towers need fiber to it

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] Alright#0419
so there's that

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] LocoMB#8593
why not rewire the fucking moon

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] Tek#5253
the entire internet is one centralized stuff.

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] Tek#5253
how r you gonna build a decentralized network on it?

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] Tek#5253
it needs new wires. and thats exactly whats happening with the 5g roll out

[30-May-19 05:19 AM] Tek#5253
fiber everywhere

[30-May-19 05:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's actually a series of tubes

[30-May-19 05:20 AM] Tek#5253
well yeah but for now the tubes are coper and slow

[30-May-19 05:20 AM] Tek#5253
thats gonna change

[30-May-19 05:20 AM] Tek#5253
for 5g rollout

[30-May-19 05:21 AM] Tek#5253
they have to

Series of tubes
"A series of tubes" is a phrase coined originally as an analogy by then-United States Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) to describe the Internet in the context of opposing network neutrality. On June 28, 2006, he used this metaphor to criticize a proposed amendment to a committe...

[30-May-19 05:21 AM] Tek#5253
they also recently 100xed the throughput of fibre

[30-May-19 05:22 AM] Tek#5253
so the "muh must keep 1mb blocks cause cant propagate" is gonna be a non issue

[30-May-19 05:22 AM] Tek#5253
storage is also becoming a non issue once they figure out how to do chemical storage correctly

[30-May-19 05:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
large blocks have many problems

[30-May-19 05:22 AM] Tek#5253
chemical storage = store data on sand like grains

[30-May-19 05:22 AM] Tek#5253
it can hold gigamigamilion bytes

[30-May-19 05:23 AM] Tek#5253
you get my point

[30-May-19 05:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
no, i don't

[30-May-19 05:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
not enough hopium, hold on

[30-May-19 05:23 AM] Tek#5253
sec i'll find

Belgian research could replace USB sticks with data stored in powder
Belgian researchers have developed a way of storing data in powder form, which they hope will replace less environmentally friendly technology such as USB sticks and avert a data storage crisis.

[30-May-19 05:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
even 4MB blocks can have problems, just ask @Alright

[30-May-19 05:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
so it's not that we don't know how to store terabytes on a grain of sand

[30-May-19 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
entirely depends on the implementation

[30-May-19 05:24 AM] Tek#5253
so eventually they will be able to store the whole contents of the internet in a cup of coffee object

[30-May-19 05:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright when is KMD upgrading to gigameg blocks?

[30-May-19 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
8mb blocks are in the code already I believe ðŸ˜‰

[30-May-19 05:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
gosh

[30-May-19 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
just a long ass time until it activates

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] Tek#5253
bsv already succesfully tested 512mb blocks i believe

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] Tek#5253
so

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] Tek#5253
yeah

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright you hear that?

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
it just works

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
gigajiggameg blocks

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
test it on mainnet

[30-May-19 05:25 AM] Tek#5253
ðŸ˜„

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] Tek#5253
bruh as i said, its pointless to test untill theres new wires. need fibre for it

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] Tek#5253
but it will come

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
simple solution to scaling is just run the chain you need to run

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
ignore the rest

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] Tek#5253
the current infra is not ok for 5G support
