```I‚Äôm reasonably convinced that McAfee is probably correct, because if I measure an equivalent length moonshot into¬†11¬†from current price levels on¬†a live version of the complete Bitcoin price history chart, then I get some price ranging from $1.2 million to $3 million.```

Dick Math. Seems more legit than any TA I've seen üòÑ

If Bitcoin is 1+million, then I bet komodo is at least $1000

Russia bans smartphones without local software
Supporters say the law on new sales promotes Russian technology but there are concerns about surveillance.

I expect some bounce here, but kmdbtc should retest 7850 and kmdusd 60c. Sorry can't seem to post charts today.

[22-Nov-19 09:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you need to host charts externally

Heres the one I posted a while back when the bear divs started... blues retrace as a rule:

Here you see the same on btc. The pump was totally unstable from the beginning, making blue candles and they had to retrace.

[22-Nov-19 10:26 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Holy crap

[22-Nov-19 10:26 AM] Privatoshi#9487
We are looking like we did last year

[22-Nov-19 10:27 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Down to $6200 to $6700

[22-Nov-19 10:27 AM] Privatoshi#9487
And we all know happened after that

[22-Nov-19 10:29 AM] Oszy#5734
still waiting on dominance to drop

[22-Nov-19 10:30 AM] richardt#2807
Keep waiting. Likely wont drop until after the halving

[22-Nov-19 10:31 AM] Bitfinger#6245
I have a scary weekly blue down at 5k, but I don't think we'll go there yet... should bounce on that 100ema

Sorry these TV charts show up crappy

[22-Nov-19 10:34 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I dont see why we couldn't. Most bitcoin holders and traders try to trade with the trend

[22-Nov-19 10:35 AM] Privatoshi#9487
And they end up on the wrong end,  of the trade.

[22-Nov-19 10:35 AM] Privatoshi#9487
My philosophy is if btc isnt going up, or sideways, people lose confidence.

[22-Nov-19 10:36 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I have a 10x short, running since $8060

[22-Nov-19 10:37 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I have 0 complaints

[22-Nov-19 10:37 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@Bitfinger What is your prediction,  by weeks end?

[22-Nov-19 10:43 AM] Bitfinger#6245
I'm not sure until I see how the market reacts to the bottom of my flag, but I'm reasonably sure we'll see the 8k range again before 5k.

[22-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I think you're right.  I planned on closing my short soon anyways.

[22-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
6500-7000 bottom range?

[22-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'll wait for confirmation, for the way back up

[22-Nov-19 10:46 AM] Privatoshi#9487
We hit a 5 month low

[22-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Bitfinger#6245
It's always good to take some profit, it helps ease the nerves when/if it bounces

[22-Nov-19 10:49 AM] Privatoshi#9487
It's a $1000 move on a 10x short.. I'll happily take it

[22-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I had it at 25x, but I moved out, and back down to 10x.. anything more than 10x, is gambling to me

[22-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Alts.. they need to stay where they are at, and trade sideways, at least

[22-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Privatoshi#9487
At least the good ones

[22-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Nice trade, well done

[22-Nov-19 11:03 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Yeah I look at the chart, draw trend lines, find support and resistance, take a quick glance at RSI etc.. then write the trade down, entry, exit and stop loss, and then make the trade and exit the exchange immediately.

[22-Nov-19 11:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you can set a stoploss now to take profit once reversal is set?

[22-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or do you already actively shift SL's

[22-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Privatoshi#9487
No. I meant I shorted at $8060 with an $8220 SL, target $6900

[22-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'll miss my target by a little,  but its okay.

[22-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I was reaching.

[22-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Now I will watch the chart and wait for confirmation,  on the move either way.

[22-Nov-19 11:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'll watch ETH and BCH now too

[22-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
upward?

[22-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
dont they follow btc when it moves?

[22-Nov-19 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so first btc moves up again, then after eth/bch and other largecaps follow

[22-Nov-19 11:08 AM] Privatoshi#9487
No. Not necessarily.  ETH/USD

[22-Nov-19 11:08 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I go where the chart says it will go

[22-Nov-19 11:09 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm not trading against the trend bc of a personal feeling or past instances

[22-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Follow the trend and wait for confirmation... good advice

[22-Nov-19 11:11 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@Cryptoon Right?

[22-Nov-19 11:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah for sure

[22-Nov-19 11:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Just pointing out some trends from the past

[22-Nov-19 11:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
BTC moves first, then bigcaps, then midcaps, smallcaps last if btc doesnt spoil the party first

[22-Nov-19 11:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it's somewhat of a guidance of what to watch

[22-Nov-19 11:13 AM] Privatoshi#9487
What has changed to me is that it is only specific alts.

[22-Nov-19 11:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
'oh btc is moving, better start watching ETH charts as well'

[22-Nov-19 11:13 AM] Privatoshi#9487
It used to go btc up, alts sideways, btc sideways, then alts up

[22-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Now, it's only the good alts

[22-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Privatoshi#9487
When btc goes down, bnb will go up

[22-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Markus#5464
kmd didnt drop a sweat from this btc drop today

[22-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Markus#5464
interesting !

[22-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Lol that's legit. KMD holds up well to btc, compared to other alts

[22-Nov-19 11:15 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I want to see KMD hit 0.01 ETH

[22-Nov-19 11:17 AM] Privatoshi#9487
LINK, KMD, SNX, BNB, XTZ, HUSH, ARRR, ETP... that's my shortlist of alts

[22-Nov-19 11:19 AM] Markus#5464
only kmd and arrr being interesting for me, maybe bnb for somewhat safe bet

[22-Nov-19 11:19 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Yeah everyone is different

[22-Nov-19 11:20 AM] Markus#5464
im more cautious now a days considering how scammy crypto market is

[22-Nov-19 11:20 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Same here üòâ

[22-Nov-19 11:28 AM] CoinKing88#1540
KMD moving forward again, BTC being down brings the possibility of nice sat gains. More BTC and same dollarvalue is allright for me too in these uncertain times

[22-Nov-19 12:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Would be nice to have weekly close here and next weekly candle to bounce from here

[22-Nov-19 12:35 PM] richardt#2807
What are you guys smoking? The majority of alts held roughly the same today üòÑ

[22-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Yeah they did hold the same. 
But the Bitcoin chart looks like hell.
