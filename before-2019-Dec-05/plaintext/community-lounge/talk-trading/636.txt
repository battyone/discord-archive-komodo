only 6k?

[12-May-19 09:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
6850 was supposed to be resistance

[12-May-19 09:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When fomo hits all bets are off

[12-May-19 09:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Next stop moontown

[12-May-19 09:37 AM] Markus#5464
well its not impossible that we will hit 10k at this point...but correction will for sure rek ppl cause its going parabolic at this point

[12-May-19 09:37 AM] jorian#4555
i see a lot of folks reading the bitcoin dominance chart, and having targets at 64-67%

[12-May-19 09:37 AM] jorian#4555
maybe not immediately, but after a small retrace

[12-May-19 09:37 AM] jorian#4555
so yeah, 10k certainly not impossible

[12-May-19 09:38 AM] Markus#5464
i quess this  could be one of those "pre bull markets"

[12-May-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
didn't BTC go up a lot before the previous alt season?

[12-May-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
in any way, we can be sure a bull market is starting.

[12-May-19 09:39 AM] jorian#4555
my family is talking about it again, CNBC said it's going parabolic

[12-May-19 09:39 AM] jorian#4555
time to short üòÑ

[12-May-19 09:40 AM] Markus#5464
BitMex (BTC) Bitcoin Longs vs Shorts
LONGS: $333,678,583 70.43%
SHORTS: $140,071,885 29.57%

[12-May-19 09:40 AM] Markus#5464
reversal could be highly possible

[12-May-19 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc went to 20k before january, then in january it was alt season with almost 2k eth

[12-May-19 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc dropped a bit in jan which gave alts time to breathe

[12-May-19 09:42 AM] Markus#5464
didnt eth have 2 runs in 2017?

yeah

[12-May-19 10:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah im talking the cryptokitties run in jan 18

[12-May-19 10:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
‚ÄòMuh flippening‚Äô

[12-May-19 10:03 AM] Bittersweet#9376
How long until alt rally

[12-May-19 10:03 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Couple of months?

[12-May-19 10:03 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Gonna be gud

[12-May-19 10:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Eth will moon shortly

[12-May-19 10:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Last time was btc mooning oct - dec and alts only starting to moon in december ish

[12-May-19 10:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But now might be a different story

[12-May-19 10:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Lets hope for alt/btc decoupling

[12-May-19 10:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Alts hve always lagged btc

[12-May-19 10:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also alts rally in tides

[12-May-19 10:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Bigger ones will go first

[12-May-19 10:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But anyway, ETH setup is quite inviting

[12-May-19 10:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well i think there is something else going on. Binance is the biggest KMD exchange, if people cannot deposit BTC to buy.....the price will drop

[12-May-19 10:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
From what i can see they have about 7-8M KMD on their exchange

[12-May-19 10:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
People not being able to deposit BTC to buy and people selling due to the price going down, which promotes more selling etc...

[12-May-19 10:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, i guess that can be part of th issue

[12-May-19 10:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It also means we basically depend on Binance and if it were to close down, there would be little to no liquidity. Hopefully MM 2.0 solves that

[12-May-19 10:21 AM] Tek#5253
> deposit BTC

[12-May-19 10:21 AM] Tek#5253
he thinks people will use BTC to send to exchanges and pay a $2 fee

[12-May-19 10:22 AM] Tek#5253
im using BCH instead, much cheaper, equally fast.

[12-May-19 10:22 AM] Tek#5253
maybe rich people can still use BTC

[12-May-19 10:22 AM] Tek#5253
but us not so rich ones wont pay a $2 fee to get our 300 bux on binance

[12-May-19 10:23 AM] Tek#5253
binance kmd withdraw fee is extremely low which is nice. i've withdrawn kmd over 20 times I think

[12-May-19 10:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so in 24 hrs BTC increased by 1000 USD ü§î

[12-May-19 10:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah. Expect it to comeback $1k in a few hours too eventually

[12-May-19 10:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is actually a huge short squeeze

[12-May-19 10:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We had shorts going up since $4k area

[12-May-19 10:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Most of those had a margin call level of $6k ish

[12-May-19 10:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So that was the fuel to boost price above the 6k area

[12-May-19 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ü§ë

[12-May-19 10:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would be cool to hold above 7k for a few weeks, alts moon, everything then moons

[12-May-19 10:50 AM] Malti#3948

[12-May-19 10:50 AM] Malti#3948

crossing my fingers for KMD

[12-May-19 10:52 AM] Tek#5253
hope it dose'nt go back to ATL

[12-May-19 10:53 AM] Tek#5253
(in btc)

[12-May-19 10:54 AM] Malti#3948
I would say that it would be good as a discount. But I‚Äôm all out of BTC and fiat value is constant so fek me

[12-May-19 10:59 AM] Tek#5253
hmm

[12-May-19 11:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
ATL was what 6-7k sats? üòÑ

[12-May-19 11:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
ICO was 12.5k sats i think

[12-May-19 11:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If it touches 14k I‚Äôm going in again

[12-May-19 11:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
oh wow just checked sat value

[12-May-19 11:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just need Binance to open......then i think we should recover somewhat

[12-May-19 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When does it open again?

[12-May-19 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe time my buys

[12-May-19 11:13 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

CZ wrote that early next week

[12-May-19 11:36 AM] Tek#5253
The only atl i ever saw was 13k sats

[12-May-19 11:36 AM] Tek#5253
HOWEVER

[12-May-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
@hyperDEX the kmd ico was 12.5k sats /  KMD ?

[12-May-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
so I guess anything between 10k and 20k sats is still the bottom

[12-May-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
600 sats

[12-May-19 11:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Really? i thought it was around 12.5k sats, must have been thinking about something else then

[12-May-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
atl

[12-May-19 11:42 AM] LocoMB#8593
maybe I am mistaken, but I think I rememebr 6000 Sats?!?!

[12-May-19 11:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
when did it get to 600 sats lol

[12-May-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
during the hacks, panic sells

[12-May-19 11:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I remember 6-7k didnt see 600

[12-May-19 11:43 AM] LocoMB#8593
I think 6000 Sats was what I paid as convetred from BTCD

[12-May-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
6k sats was the normal price for a while after trading started

[12-May-19 11:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and ATH was about 100k sats sigh lol

[12-May-19 11:44 AM] Markus#5464
