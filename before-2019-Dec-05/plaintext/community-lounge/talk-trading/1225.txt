someone huge number of HUSH put on KMD at AtomicDEX a couple of weeks ago there were about 2000 thousand coins and now there are about 500 left who sells so many coins at such a low price? Either Hush will die completely or he has nowhere else to fall below, and so the capitalization is extremely low, I think it's some kind of miner selling an electricity bill

A bot malfunction is possible, didn't expect that there a bots with that kind of liquidity out there to be honest.

[04-Dec-19 09:17 PM] CHMEX#0686
also not sure about the malfunction but somehow I would expect a 500k buy or something...
maybe a bot trying to try other bots to sell into them... who knows....

@peddycb be careful with large amounts. don't get scammed. if you want i can do escrow.

[04-Dec-19 10:52 PM] hastrup#8742
I have used  @SHossain many times as an escrow very good service!

[04-Dec-19 10:57 PM] SHossain#0007
