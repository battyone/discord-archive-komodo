It was busted by crypto cats

[01-Jul-19 03:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are you blind?

[01-Jul-19 03:11 AM] meatspoon#7860
it can be dogshit, but dogshit reigns supreme right now

[01-Jul-19 03:11 AM] meatspoon#7860
its not about me

[01-Jul-19 03:11 AM] meatspoon#7860
its about the market, marketing, brand recognition, etc

[01-Jul-19 03:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Cool, rock your ETH t-shirt

[01-Jul-19 03:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Need an actual product?

[01-Jul-19 03:12 AM] meatspoon#7860
i love your commentary, Hollow.  but you have drank too much Koolaid out in the post apocalyptic sun

[01-Jul-19 03:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Won‚Äôt be ETH you‚Äôre running to

[01-Jul-19 03:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I get your argument

[01-Jul-19 03:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I do

[01-Jul-19 03:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But brand recognition for what now, it‚Äôs a name

[01-Jul-19 03:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs it at this point

[01-Jul-19 03:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
As a product it can‚Äôt perform

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] meatspoon#7860
but it doesnt matter right now

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
As a pumptard it‚Äôs great ‚ÄúETH bruh!  It‚Äôs like smart tech n Shit‚Äù

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
dogshit does reign supreme right now

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] meatspoon#7860
because the corporations are rallying around it, it has been declared Kosher by the SEC

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
As someone looking for a chain solution, ‚Äúif I base my business on this, fees will murder me‚Äù

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Perfect, build on it

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] meatspoon#7860
who the fuck is looking for a chain solution?

[01-Jul-19 03:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Oh wait

[01-Jul-19 03:15 AM] meatspoon#7860
people are looking for money

[01-Jul-19 03:15 AM] meatspoon#7860
ETH has the spotlight.  KMD is some weirdo masturbating in the dark recesses of the stage

[01-Jul-19 03:15 AM] meatspoon#7860
sorry

[01-Jul-19 03:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
The spotlight

[01-Jul-19 03:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
For what?

[01-Jul-19 03:15 AM] meatspoon#7860
you tell me

[01-Jul-19 03:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What are the pros of ETH

[01-Jul-19 03:16 AM] meatspoon#7860
lol

[01-Jul-19 03:16 AM] meatspoon#7860
one of the pros is that of the people who know what BTC is, a small minority knows what ETH is

[01-Jul-19 03:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a smart contract platform‚Äù

[01-Jul-19 03:16 AM] meatspoon#7860
less than 1% of people who know what BTC is can reasonably explain what KMD is

[01-Jul-19 03:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
the fact that de-dollarization is accelerating does not bode well for the future reach of any us financial regulatory powers. they will be unceremoniously ignored worldwide. the stamp of approval from the sec is more irrelevant everyday

[01-Jul-19 03:18 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

ETH was a neat experiment

[01-Jul-19 03:18 AM] meatspoon#7860
i mean, you can eat dog food out in the desert as along as you like saying that KMD is the future.  and you might be right... but its not the immediate future.  It is so far behind ETH is makes you sound delusional when you claim that KMD is a competitor of ETH

[01-Jul-19 03:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It really was

[01-Jul-19 03:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But it‚Äôs over

[01-Jul-19 03:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not, name recognition!‚Äù

[01-Jul-19 03:18 AM] meatspoon#7860
yeah?  Over like BTC is over?

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
over half the vocal participants in this channel think BTC is a shitcoin

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
lol

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC still does what it always did, digital currency

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
ETH failed to scale

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
BTC has outperformed nearly everything]

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
ETH won‚Äôt scale

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
no?  does your crystal ball tell you that?

[01-Jul-19 03:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Does twitchy mcblinkerin even own any anymore?

[01-Jul-19 03:20 AM] meatspoon#7860
there are plenty of people in this channel that will echo that

[01-Jul-19 03:20 AM] meatspoon#7860
that is a non-argument and it cheapens your stance

[01-Jul-19 03:20 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Believe what you want

[01-Jul-19 03:20 AM] meatspoon#7860
twitchy mcblinkerin's cock is like miles larger than yours.

[01-Jul-19 03:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Lawl

[01-Jul-19 03:21 AM] meatspoon#7860
but you are here regularly talking shit on someone who will never even know you existed.

[01-Jul-19 03:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And this matters why?

[01-Jul-19 03:21 AM] meatspoon#7860
when you ad hominem people, you expose your lack of argument

[01-Jul-19 03:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve presented my argument

[01-Jul-19 03:22 AM] meatspoon#7860
no, you have attacked the leader of Ethereum by attacking his manerisms

[01-Jul-19 03:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Your rebuttal was ‚Äúmuh name rekognishun‚Äù

[01-Jul-19 03:22 AM] p.#1126

[01-Jul-19 03:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[01-Jul-19 03:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
all of crypto is almost pure speculation right now. marketcaps are largely irrelevant. because it's all unicorn farts and rainbow dreams

[01-Jul-19 03:27 AM] p.#1126
The money you get after selling is not make believe, that's ok for  now

[01-Jul-19 03:28 AM] p.#1126
And fuccboi's mom is hot too.btw

[01-Jul-19 03:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
trading unicorn farts is fun and can be very profitable. crypto noob hunting season just kicked off so i'm pretty pumped

[01-Jul-19 03:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
but it has nothing to do with tech, just psychology

[01-Jul-19 03:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
i would guess less than half of investors even know what a utxo is

[01-Jul-19 03:34 AM] p.#1126
Ppl make worse bets every day with less potential return anyways
 So if it doesnt work out I'll just sleep with your mothers

Weekly candle closed in a beautiful rejection of the lower bollinger formation and with bullish divergence in RSI

[01-Jul-19 07:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Most plausible direction now is up

on the discussion where the view that only marketcap matters, my comment is that if that was true, then BTC matters not much at all due to:
https://www.fiatmarketcap.com/
35    BTC    17,791,025 BTC    
a bit less than NZD
