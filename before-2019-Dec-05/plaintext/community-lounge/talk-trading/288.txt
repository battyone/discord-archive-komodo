For now, Komodo is in the top 25 of the project "dying" the fastest (if we only look at the price) it's one of the biggest looser in top 100 CMC. But i'm not worry for Komodo. The dragon shall be unleashed.

[19-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There is somewhat of a trend that commits are slowing down

[19-Nov-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
that is just looking at the barterDEX core repo and not any of the half a dozen other repo. be careful what info you believe

[19-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I know miso is only tracking one repo

[19-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if you look at the general chart for the top 10

[19-Nov-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
#feed-github shows at least the commits from several KMD repos

[19-Nov-18 03:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
EOS/ADA/TRX/LSK/... all slowing down

[19-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362

18 block re-org on $BSV is quite serious, exchanges might start increasing confirmations with deposits and potentially consider delisting it.
