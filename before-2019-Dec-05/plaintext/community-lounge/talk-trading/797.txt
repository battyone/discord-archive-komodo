The Top Ten Altcoin Markets of 2014 - How Are They Faring Now?
With the number of altcoins listed on Coinmarketcap reaching 1640 as of this writing, the question begs - how will all of these altcoin markets perform in the long term? When looking back four years at a historic snapshot of the leading markets from June 1st, 2014, one can se...

You're all looking at it the wrong way around: BTC value isn't dropping, FIAT value is rising....

[21-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
who cares about fiat value? fiat is inflationary and usd as example wont exist sooner or later it will be replaced by something else

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Keppie#5156
Still think that argument is bs. I care about fiat. USD or EUR won't dissapear anytime soon

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Exactly my point... Then why does everybody measure the value of crypto in fiat?

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Keppie#5156
would be a shame to not take profits in fiat

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Markus#5464
if u care about fiat u would want more btc from ur alt coins

[21-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Markus#5464
then u profit twice

[21-Jun-19 02:24 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Bitcoin is the benchmark, not the standard IMO. In the long term BTC blockchain will prove 'impractical' (long term? isn't LN a band-aid?) and will be surpassed by moderns blockchains like the Komodo ecosystem.
