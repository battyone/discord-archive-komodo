That is for you to think about üòõ

[16-Jul-19 08:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
maybe she wants a kid

[16-Jul-19 08:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
or wants more sex, dont know

[16-Jul-19 08:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`maybe she wants a kid`
Then maybe she should get her tubes untied üòõ
Or my vasectomy undone

[16-Jul-19 08:36 PM] Markus#5464
In the end i feel like there is too much negativity going on in this channel lately, i think its time to bring a more positive attitude and support kmd in a more supportive way rather then bashing

But to equate people liking or not liking a logo to the team not listening to existing investors or old investors is a stretch

` i think its time to bring a more positive attitude `
OK, I'm *positive* that the new logo looks like the beginning of conception

Its not a surprise that ppl would not like the new logo, some will like and some wont. Cant make everyone happy its literally impossible

[16-Jul-19 08:40 PM] dan.#2473
but, its a bit different with a gradient background. id be interested to see the new logo like this instead

Ok let's change the subject

[16-Jul-19 11:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
ICO = initial coin offering
IEO = Initial Exchange offering
???? = Initial DEX offering?

[16-Jul-19 11:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
dICO but rebranded

[16-Jul-19 11:35 PM] JimD#9272
We love the D-ICO here

[16-Jul-19 11:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
dDO or dIDO looks crap

Oh you are right cipi, dont need the decentralized when we have DEX already

[16-Jul-19 11:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I like it

[16-Jul-19 11:37 PM] JimD#9272
Id say IDXO

[16-Jul-19 11:38 PM] JimD#9272
I ascociate D with decentralized

[16-Jul-19 11:38 PM] hyperDEX#6586
so IDXO initial decentralized exchange offering?

[16-Jul-19 11:39 PM] JimD#9272
ya, gotta get the X to make it dexy

[16-Jul-19 11:39 PM] allbits#5898
Expensive to launch a full featured blockchain. Charged a year in advance. Would a per month option be useful?

[16-Jul-19 11:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@ca333

[16-Jul-19 11:44 PM] hyperDEX#6586
What do you guys think of this idea.

We start a new chain, Lotto1 coin. We put the whole supply of it on the DEX. People buy it with the free test coins.

At x days in the future we do a snapshot to see who has what, each Lotto1 coin = 1 ticket. We do a draw for say 1000KMD

[16-Jul-19 11:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Obviously later, people can buy the tickets with actual coins like KMD and becomes a decentralized lotto game.

üî• 

[16-Jul-19 11:47 PM] Caglio#3337
@hyperDEX actually lotto draws, always draw public, so the idea is good

[16-Jul-19 11:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Well it tests the DEX and gets people aware of KMD

[16-Jul-19 11:47 PM] shrk#2280
how are test coins distributed? something to stop me from getting a bunch of tickets and increasing my chances?

[16-Jul-19 11:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will work on the idea, but need to have desktop apps and apple app ready to go before we get more people

[16-Jul-19 11:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@shrk nope, go for your life üòÑ

[16-Jul-19 11:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Will be the monty coins, go to faucet get coins, go to dex buy lotto1 coins

[16-Jul-19 11:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So if people want to spend their time doing that, no worries.

[16-Jul-19 11:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We need to fix the initial issues people raise, then we will be ready for a mass test. This is when the promotions should happen.

[16-Jul-19 11:51 PM] shrk#2280
I know some guys have collected automatically quite a lot coins from the faucet

[16-Jul-19 11:51 PM] shrk#2280
Chainzilla for example

Careful with lottos they are regulated everywhere

[17-Jul-19 12:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Frame it as a sweepstakes

first to market

[17-Jul-19 01:55 AM] meatspoon#7860
if you are the first to market in a meaningful way as a privacy coin, why would you ever change your logo?  I am sure someone is going to reference a privacy coin that predated Monero, but even so, Monero made it first to market.  Timing is important.
