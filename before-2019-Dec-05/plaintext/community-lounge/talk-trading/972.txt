You bet $100, if casino edge is 1%, regardless of if you win or lose, you lost $1

[26-Jul-19 10:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is variance but statically you lose.

[26-Jul-19 10:16 AM] Caglio#3337
yeah

[26-Jul-19 10:16 AM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jul-19 10:31 AM] jansako#3330
the sell side is empty, there is just nothing to buy...

[26-Jul-19 10:32 AM] Markus#5464
would be fun to see if u would put sell at 40k if it would actually get sold

[26-Jul-19 10:32 AM] jansako#3330
go for it & good luck!

[26-Jul-19 10:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
too much effort

[26-Jul-19 10:45 AM] jansako#3330
well if he is right and there would be a couple of thousand KMD to be sold for 40k... I don't have an account so will pass on this one
