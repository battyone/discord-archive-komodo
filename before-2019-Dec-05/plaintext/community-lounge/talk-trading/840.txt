It's a great honor that Pirate is mentioned at Monerokon. I have heard that they don't speak of any Monero forks there, so Pirate was one of the few other coins mentioned at the conf at all

[25-Jun-19 02:01 PM] PTYX#6840
without any planning to make it what it is. it's pretty awesome and it has done what other projects have failed to do.

[25-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Malti#3948
that's amazing from Monerokon

[25-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Malti#3948
+ they admitted it in their telegram

[25-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Malti#3948
nice

[25-Jun-19 02:02 PM] PTYX#6840
it's getting noticed that's for sure

[25-Jun-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
zcash twitter also acknowledging PIRATE awesomeness

[25-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Malti#3948
cool from the monero community as well

[25-Jun-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c the foundation did, not the company üòâ

[25-Jun-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
Pirate scares ECC too much, still

[25-Jun-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it does?

[25-Jun-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZcashFoundation is the new kid on the playground and needs to make friends

[25-Jun-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i assume it does, they haven't publicly posted "We are afraid of Pirate", yet

[25-Jun-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
but it looks so bad that Pirate has so much larger of a shielded pool, already

[25-Jun-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
Nobody uses the features of Zcash that make it Zcash

[25-Jun-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
Everybody uses the features of Pirate that makes it Pirate

nobody will use it unless it's enforced

[25-Jun-19 02:04 PM] PTYX#6840
and those that will use it will be in the 5%

[25-Jun-19 02:06 PM] PTYX#6840
People value convenience over privacy. You can't give them the option if you truly want it to be private.

u would think it could pullback anytime soon but who knows

[25-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Markus#5464
didnt rly touch height of previous high

[25-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Keppie#5156
Charted same resistance. It all comes down how we handle this resistance

[25-Jun-19 02:09 PM] Markus#5464
and if we break up from this channel....cause it looks like its a channel based on touch points....then target could be double up the height of this channel

[25-Jun-19 02:09 PM] Markus#5464
that would put btc dominance at around 69%

[25-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully that wont be the case....that would mean alot more bleeding for alts

[25-Jun-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in the long run it wont matter so much and would mean BTC gets to $20k in the short term, which is probably what is needed to get domination to that level

[25-Jun-19 02:13 PM] Markus#5464
possibility then is if btc reach 20k it could form a cup and handle pattern and that would be even worse for alts

[25-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Keppie#5156
Markus, optimism my friend. Have some optimism

[25-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Keppie#5156
We'll be fine

:troll_king:

[25-Jun-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this is just the sucking in of fiat (and everthing else) into BTC. the more it increases, the more potential energy and the bigger the boost for the alts, at least denominated in fiat

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[25-Jun-19 02:15 PM] Markus#5464
but what if there wont even be a alt season similar to 2017 like everyone is hoping for

[25-Jun-19 02:15 PM] designer#4893
If 1 percent of pension funds are injected into bitcoin, 
bitcoin's price will be easily exceeded by $350,000.

[25-Jun-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-Jun-19 02:15 PM] designer#4893
Of course, that's gonna be a lot of ups and downs.

[25-Jun-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and at some point the fiat arb bots wont be able to get any buyers as people will start hesitating before spending more for a BTC than most houses (castles previously shown not counted)

[25-Jun-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the natural reaction is to find something cheaper that still has good ROI potential

[25-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
well in that case ofc

[25-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Keppie#5156
short vs longterm perspective here

[25-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Sherdogz#6731
By that time alts will be super rekt

[25-Jun-19 02:18 PM] kaks#6612
next year btc halving, think the price will double

[25-Jun-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
also, the only people still holding any alt wont be selling for 10% gains

{Reactions}
‚¨Ü 

[25-Jun-19 02:18 PM] kaks#6612
agree with that

[25-Jun-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as fiat price is reasonably stable, regardless of BTC satoshi price, i wouldnt consider it rekt

[25-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
kmd need a usd pair on any exchange with great liquidity

[25-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Keppie#5156
Conebase

[25-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
or usdt pair on binance

[25-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Keppie#5156
Copied a tweet from Brian armstrong here yesterday. We need to reach out to him

[25-Jun-19 02:21 PM] designer#4893
public is not smart. It's public nature to get easily excited and panic.

[25-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Markus#5464
he would probably be more interested in Pirate if u think about his tweet then kmd

A scalable, sufficiently decentralized, chain that supported private transactions by default (privacy coins) would be a game changer.

he's talking about the chain

[25-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Keppie#5156
that supports it

[25-Jun-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
he started marketing PIRATE

[25-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How is pirate scalable outside of any other chain?

[25-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can pirate utilize the parallel chain solution KMD provides?

[25-Jun-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
not yet, a few technical issue need to be solved

[25-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
imagine pirate smart contracts

[25-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How is launching parallel chains managed in a decentralized way?

[25-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pirate1 is full, launch Pirate2

[25-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who mines it

[25-Jun-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the chains need to have the same -ac_cc=<clusterid>

[25-Jun-19 02:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
alt season in 2017 brewed for 2 years before that

[25-Jun-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
miners would mine whichever chain they mine

[25-Jun-19 02:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like people are forgetting that while BTC broke new ATH, alts bleeded for quite some time before they finally boosted.

[25-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So why would I transact on pirate2 which has room but few miners and not dump into the mempool of pirate1?

[25-Jun-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming they are fungible, then you can use whichever chain you want

[25-Jun-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but clusters are only for taddrs now

[25-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hence my scalable question with regard to that tweet

[25-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming equilibrium states, two chains with fungible coins (of same value), both chains would end up at similar hashrates

[25-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Would a crosschain z-tx utilize viewkeys?

[25-Jun-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@Hollowman9000 i think the way to deal with cross-chain ztx is to create a special case for migration transactions

[25-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
z-t t-z

[25-Jun-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-Jun-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so not impossible and actually doesnt seem like such a big problem

[25-Jun-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but PIRATE chain is far from saturated, plenty of time to solve it

[25-Jun-19 02:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Shouldn‚Äôt compromise privacy, t addresses appearing and disappearing like virtual particle pairs in the quantum foam of spacetime

[25-Jun-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a very small leakage, and as long as you do a z -> z on the other side, it should blend back into the giant anon set

[25-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Automate it

[25-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt trust the user, have the network enforce it

[25-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Treat it like a coinbase tx that must be shielded

[25-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well it‚Äôs that by default

[25-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Disregard

[25-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, PIRATE makes it really hard to mess up your privacy

[25-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Would a cusp transaction be treated differently so as to need 4 addresses to be accepted so no t addresses could be left funded without transferring to the respective z address on the parallel pirate chain?

[25-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
(Z-t, t-z, 4 addresses)

[25-Jun-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i think just z -> t (export) and t (import) -> z, that will be sufficient

[25-Jun-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
as each next tx does the z -> z

[25-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But you don‚Äôt want that chain to be interrupted, or funds could accumulate in t addresses

[25-Jun-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the cross chain process would be via automated process, so only people who abort it would have taddr coins lying about

[25-Jun-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and then all they can do is send it to a zaddr

[25-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I guess what I‚Äôm after is maintaining shielded percentage

[25-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Petty I guess

[25-Jun-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we could make a consensus rule that allows anybody to spend anything in a taddr if it stays there for more than a month
