@PHBA2061 I didn't "confound" anything. Perhaps you should do more reading of Ponzi's life than what some random person decided to note in "Wikipedia"...

The creation of an intangible object (a "store of value" chain) that serves no purpose other than to sell it for more to the next guy than you paid for it would be right up his alley

is 50% what Komodo team had?

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it ws 90%

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
90% burn or 50% burn?

[18-Sep-18 12:12 PM] snowdamn#2414

[18-Sep-18 12:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
i mean its kind of surreal. You have these Ico's spending millions to up their cmc rankings. and you got cast aside projects and 
past associates making up a large percentage of this ecosystem.

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
is it just an open secret? Has intellectual curiosity really atrophied this much?

also, not saying jinn will not deliver

[18-Sep-18 12:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
I guess we are still a relatively small group of people. it felt like a movement was happening for awhile there

[18-Sep-18 12:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
I know @Bryan_Beus  has been doing yeoman's work as far as documenting but no one still really knows the story here it seems

[18-Sep-18 12:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have been summoned...

[18-Sep-18 12:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
yes, just making a point that no one seems to understand the history of this project and how intertwined it is with iota, ardor. btcd, etc

[18-Sep-18 12:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, the history of this community goes pretty deep. I joined about a year ago, and am vaguely familiar with the story, but couldn't write anything super accurate. 

Best is to go to the NXT forum and look through JL's history.

[18-Sep-18 12:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In short: NXT tried to bottleneck the developers, and JL and company left to start KMD, so that it wouldn't happen again. 

BTCD: A project JL and a few others (ca ?) were involved in, and when they left, they kept their commitment to those folk by giving a swap opportunity.

ARDR: Nothing much in common. ARDR, I believe, is the next iteration of NXT.

[18-Sep-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
ARDR is a half coin

[18-Sep-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
just does the staking part and the rest is split off into IGNIS, which is a 50% taxed airdrop of NXT

[18-Sep-18 12:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
yeah ardor is crap, so is btcd, but its 70 mil marketcap just goes to show what kind of madness is still at play here. I just wanted to say that I am appreciative of the work you put in @Bryan_Beus and am glad you joined the cause.

[18-Sep-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@CHMEX you have contacts at CMC, maybe you can let them know about the RD6 burned BTCD? but there probably isnt even a working explorer...

[18-Sep-18 12:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
I also think a well referenced and linked timeline of projects and subsequent rankings/valuations would be instructional to newcomers and would serve as a boon to the kmd ecosystem in general.

[18-Sep-18 12:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
to compare kmd to some eth token is a true disservice

[18-Sep-18 12:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think we did a blog post on this awhile ago. You'd need to ask @Daniel CP ?

I'm trying to focus on getting documentation into shape, so I wouldn't be able to work on anything else for awhile.

A bit of history and a basic KMD timeline

[18-Sep-18 12:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
@snowdamn  It kinda already is, but the teeth are well hidden

[18-Sep-18 12:50 PM] Daniel CP#2020
And yeah, the marketing team is actually working on a longer piece now about the larger Komodo ecosystem

[18-Sep-18 12:50 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Will focus on all the projects using Komodo's tech and showcase the progress that's being made

[18-Sep-18 12:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
@actionslacks yes, Top 50 will do for now üòÉ

[18-Sep-18 12:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
The best representation would be a web that fans out to all the projects/assets using the tech and that have had past associations. But yeah, like I said. I'm fine with the shadows and the ignorance of the masses. There was a lot of whining about lack of marketing in the past. Now that's gone, thankfully.

[18-Sep-18 01:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
I asked CMC now to set BTCD as inactive I did not find a working explorer anymore.

[18-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I remember buying BTCD at 30k sats right about the same time James announced joining the dev group. The coin double up in only a few hours.

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  my citation was taken on the same page as what you've cited on wikipedia.
Besides I was answering to your question why btc is a better store of value relative  to eth or kmd (at least for now), or hyperinflated currencies . I never said it is a good store of value , compared to gold or any traditional store of value.

[18-Sep-18 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@PHBA2061 I don't recall ever citing wiki for Ponzi, ever
and I must have missed where you were " answering to [my] question why btc is a better store of value relative to eth or kmd", could you please reiterate....
