Atm it appears the killer app is money

[06-Aug-19 09:27 PM] nocturnal#2177
yup

[06-Aug-19 09:27 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Hence partnerships and usability

[06-Aug-19 09:27 PM] dan.#2473
theres a big difference for btc at 100k and btc at 10k. If alts stay put USD wise and btc happens to take off, i am not so sure that many alts will catch up in satoshis

[06-Aug-19 09:27 PM] nocturnal#2177
i think in the more distant future Iot and IoV will run on blockchain or whatever supercedes it

[06-Aug-19 09:28 PM] nocturnal#2177
so i do think it will have been a fundamental tech developement

[06-Aug-19 09:28 PM] nocturnal#2177
in hindsight

[06-Aug-19 09:28 PM] dan.#2473
the problem with dapps is there funnily enough needs to be a killer dapp

[06-Aug-19 09:28 PM] dan.#2473
cause the performance of dapps is inherently awful

[06-Aug-19 09:29 PM] nocturnal#2177
yea really bad

[06-Aug-19 09:29 PM] dan.#2473
so there needs to be something with a lot of utility to make the shit performance worth it

[06-Aug-19 09:29 PM] dan.#2473
which- i think there is. its not out there yet

[06-Aug-19 09:29 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
There is btc dump

[06-Aug-19 09:29 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Global borderless transfer of value and banking the unbanked is pretty good

[06-Aug-19 09:29 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Kmd is a nice indicator

[06-Aug-19 09:30 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Always dumps before

[06-Aug-19 09:30 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Money is the app

[06-Aug-19 09:30 PM] nocturnal#2177
yea money is the killer app, but also the robots will need to agree with each other

[06-Aug-19 09:31 PM] nocturnal#2177
and i think it will be useful for that ðŸ˜‚

[06-Aug-19 09:31 PM] dan.#2473
kinda funny how that sentiment has come full circle

[06-Aug-19 09:31 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Right?

[06-Aug-19 09:32 PM] nocturnal#2177
woot i want a nice btc dump rn

[06-Aug-19 09:32 PM] nocturnal#2177
i shorted at 11.9k

[06-Aug-19 09:32 PM] nocturnal#2177
finger crossed

[06-Aug-19 09:33 PM] dan.#2473
ðŸ‘Œ

[06-Aug-19 09:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
will be really interesting to see where the next support is

[06-Aug-19 09:34 PM] nocturnal#2177
could be 9k or could stay higher which would be quite bullish

[06-Aug-19 09:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
We going 7 k

[06-Aug-19 09:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But not in one candle

[06-Aug-19 09:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
:)

[06-Aug-19 09:35 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
They will milk it every step of the way

[06-Aug-19 09:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
haha i dont reckon for a while

[06-Aug-19 09:35 PM] dan.#2473
if theres any sense to be made, i think btc is going to be range bound for a while, but i dont know

[06-Aug-19 09:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
yea exactly descending triangle around 9k base for a while

[06-Aug-19 09:35 PM] Lumbi#8378
USD is tanking vs. EUR.. interest rates vs. BTC hedge

[06-Aug-19 09:36 PM] nocturnal#2177
then drop down for peeps to fill their bags again

[06-Aug-19 09:39 PM] dan.#2473
i would pay a pretty decent fee if there was a managed portfolio available for retail. just buy a weighted crypto 100 and forget it

[06-Aug-19 09:45 PM] dan.#2473
new wlc site https://www.wlc-time.com

[06-Aug-19 09:46 PM] dan.#2473
wow

[06-Aug-19 09:46 PM] dan.#2473
lol

[06-Aug-19 09:46 PM] dan.#2473
its like acid without the acid

[06-Aug-19 09:46 PM] washparkdlt#6482
I like that idea too

[06-Aug-19 09:46 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Index coin

[06-Aug-19 09:47 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Pays stakes in btc or stable

[06-Aug-19 09:49 PM] washparkdlt#6482
There is one risk we all share that it can help with too potentially

[06-Aug-19 09:49 PM] dan.#2473
in terms of crypto a big problem is the single stock risk, cause people are so emotionally involved with 1 project

[06-Aug-19 09:49 PM] dan.#2473
a spread out fund would help solve the single stock risk

[06-Aug-19 09:49 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Sure. But I mean another risk. Longevity risk

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Crypto might be able to help

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] Lumbi#8378
what metrics would be best for an index? market cap?

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Market cap or equal weight

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Iâ€™d say market cap with btc

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Equal weight without as completion

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] nocturnal#2177
you mean giving your money for someone else to trade?

[06-Aug-19 09:50 PM] dan.#2473
good question, i would choose weighted by market caps

[06-Aug-19 09:51 PM] dan.#2473
na basically an ETF, but itll never happen

[06-Aug-19 09:51 PM] dan.#2473
at least not anytime soon

[06-Aug-19 09:51 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Itâ€™s a good idea tho

[06-Aug-19 09:51 PM] washparkdlt#6482
I think

[06-Aug-19 09:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
ah i dont know how that works

[06-Aug-19 09:52 PM] washparkdlt#6482
It would have to be custody or smart contract I guess

[06-Aug-19 09:52 PM] dan.#2473
the Spy 500 is the most common ETF for stocks. It basically just automatically buys the largest 500 corporations at any one time.

[06-Aug-19 09:52 PM] dan.#2473
something similar to that

[06-Aug-19 09:52 PM] dan.#2473
and i believe it does it by weight

[06-Aug-19 09:53 PM] washparkdlt#6482
They do both

[06-Aug-19 09:53 PM] dan.#2473
Ah alright

[06-Aug-19 09:53 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Market weighted and equal

[06-Aug-19 09:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
thing is in crypto that would be whatever was pumping and about to dump

[06-Aug-19 09:53 PM] Lumbi#8378
perhaps a AI or machine learning component?

[06-Aug-19 09:54 PM] dan.#2473
that would be ok tho. thats the point of an ETF is to subside that single stock risk. it would definitely still hurt though

[06-Aug-19 09:54 PM] dan.#2473
it would definitely be very volatile

[06-Aug-19 09:54 PM] dan.#2473
but, if the overall market grows, it would do good

[06-Aug-19 09:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah i feel you may as well just buy bitcoin

[06-Aug-19 09:54 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Crypto could replicate a pension fund also

[06-Aug-19 09:55 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Replace insurance company with a DAO

[06-Aug-19 09:55 PM] dan.#2473
thats true, people say btc = spy500

[06-Aug-19 09:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah for now

[06-Aug-19 09:55 PM] dan.#2473
btc is what they call the market rate of return

[06-Aug-19 09:55 PM] dan.#2473
anything beating btc outperforms

[06-Aug-19 09:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
maybe in the future etf type thing will work

[06-Aug-19 09:56 PM] dan.#2473
but, i would be interested in it, because i can cost average in and check it in 20 years.

[06-Aug-19 09:56 PM] nocturnal#2177
sure

[06-Aug-19 09:57 PM] dan.#2473
theres too many issues with custodianship and stuff for it to happen anytime soon

[06-Aug-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah big problems

[06-Aug-19 09:57 PM] dan.#2473
and for a company to manage this as an ETF, wont happen anytime soon

[06-Aug-19 09:57 PM] dan.#2473
SEC wont even let a BTC ETF happen

[06-Aug-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
and to perform well in crypto is a lot more complicated and evolving at the moment

[06-Aug-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
you would have to swing between btc and top alts at the right times

[06-Aug-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
get in and out of crypto to fiat

[06-Aug-19 09:58 PM] nocturnal#2177
but then all these dynamics will change as the market develops

[06-Aug-19 09:58 PM] nocturnal#2177
youd be better off paying good traders to do it for you but then they can just say "sorry i effed up and lost it all!"

[06-Aug-19 09:59 PM] dan.#2473
yeah thats risky too

[06-Aug-19 10:05 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Cordier â€” who is believed to have managed $150 million, according to a Bloomberg report â€” went on to address some of his 290 clients personally.

He thanked one client in Kansas City for barbecue sauce and told another that he owes them a Cuban sandwich

[06-Aug-19 10:06 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hard to watch video really

[06-Aug-19 10:07 PM] nocturnal#2177
ouch!

[06-Aug-19 10:10 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah a dude in china was 100x leveraging and lost like 200btc in an hour or something crazy. he didnt make it!

[06-Aug-19 10:13 PM] nocturnal#2177

[06-Aug-19 10:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
