I see it breaking out now of a little triangle

[07-Sep-19 07:58 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think kmd is gonna get up to at least top 40 in the near future

[07-Sep-19 07:58 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418

Binance is about to close US trading, It's biggest market. the neet's who cant vpn are going need to dump their chainlink or whatever somewhere. This is the opportunity.

[07-Sep-19 08:14 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
is kmd going to be on binanceUS or do i have to switch exchanges

[07-Sep-19 08:14 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
maybe btc need huge altseason like 2017 to get to new ath. And second altseason little bit later like winter 2018. Drying up everything might not be good for btc in long run. Btc might need alts more than anyone realizes at this point. Btc propaganda is so boring and maximalists look so arrogant that it takes away all interest in blochchain tech.

I understand what you mean

[07-Sep-19 08:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You need the allure of 100x alts to get the general public fomo‚Äôing into crypto in general

[07-Sep-19 08:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As it did end 2017

[07-Sep-19 08:17 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
yep, that's why

[07-Sep-19 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But those kind of pumps arent sustainable

[07-Sep-19 08:18 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
not sustainable levels of course, but alts end up 5-10x higher than currently for long time.

anybody know if changelly is any good

[07-Sep-19 08:20 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
can i buy kmd directly with usd on changelly or do i have to exchange btc for it

[07-Sep-19 08:21 PM] tolken#2655
STOs might light the alt-season fire.

[07-Sep-19 08:22 PM] tolken#2655
People will see how easy crypto is... ejected the regulated shit and then try on the Wild West version of crypto as well.

[07-Sep-19 08:25 PM] richardt#2807
Don't think there will be much alt fomo-ing anymore.  Too many people got burned after the 2017 bull market. The next alt season will probably rely heavily on alts with actual products/usage.

this is why kmd is very well positioned

[07-Sep-19 08:28 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
general interest in crypto is going way down. See this alexa rank for coinbase: https://imgur.com/a/En6qe9d

[07-Sep-19 08:28 PM] richardt#2807
Yes, if KMD could get its products (i.e. AtomicDEX) at or near full potential by the time the market shifts to alts... then it'll probably explode

[07-Sep-19 08:29 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
btc is commiting suicide without altseason.

[07-Sep-19 08:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
considering the glut of vaporware out there with zero revenue generation plan besides "the power of decentralization", kmd is a bit of a unicorn in the current field.

[07-Sep-19 08:36 PM] richardt#2807
Whitepaper pump days are over.  In general, people have grown weary of crypto due to lack of real products/utility, I think.

Some will linger for some time though

[07-Sep-19 08:39 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I agree. Exchanges doing shitty ieo's weekly make sure that you need to have good product already, if you're going to make it.

imho, heart of the problem is this: Only promoting btc probably looks bad for general public. Max Keiser with his tear up fiat money antics don't look good either. 10k btc price might be too high for npc's to get interested in crypto. Nobody is telling npc's that there are other cryptos too.

[07-Sep-19 09:04 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
btc has become too elitist.

[07-Sep-19 09:07 PM] Andersen#8337
There are people who are far from the crypto - they don't even know they can buy a fractional part of BTC.  They are not ready to buy full BTC  for 10K. That's the answer.

[07-Sep-19 09:12 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I agree, nobody is not telling that you can buy fractional part of btc too.

The 2008 banker bailouts were too long ago now. We need another crash, and subsequent bailout to educate the masses. I thought maybe nirp would be enough. But it appears most of europe is going right along with it.
