Yeah markus, but still somehow I have the feeling they will be easier to bounce back

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Caglio#3337
They are already brands that people hear off, while we are not , we are just another coin in the sea of coins

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Markus#5464
Ur just being emotional about kmd cause its ur holding thats why u think so

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Caglio#3337
I have LTC holdings also

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Caglio#3337
I went there and asked charlie lee

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
lol

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Does LTC halving means my price will halve down also

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Dont worry

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He gives 0 f&@$s he got it out at the top üòÉ

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Markus#5464
like i said u will see kmd rise to 15k and it might be last time it went to 8k this cycle

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
Oh shit, is that what a halving is?

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
KMD has had like 10 halvings.

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Markus they said "you wont be able to buy under 21 k anymore" maybe even you

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Look at us now

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Rofl

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Caglio#3337
We can go way down again

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Caglio#3337

[06-Aug-19 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
>like i said u will see kmd rise to 15k and it might be last time it went to 8k this cycle

poor linktards

[06-Aug-19 12:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
It‚Äôs like we are in a submarine and we are 100 meters below crushing depth... those weird groaning sounds are getting louder. A giant squid is starting to hug the sub

[06-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Dont worry, good accumulation period

[06-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Hate to say but there were a lot of good accumulating periods already

[06-Aug-19 01:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont worry it is just Caglio and p. making sounds together üòõ

[06-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Caglio#3337
^ hahaha @p.

[06-Aug-19 01:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, it‚Äôs like accumulation periods just keep... going.... and getting ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.

[06-Aug-19 01:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Their lovemaking must be epic

[06-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, buy the dip or u gonna miss d train bro

[06-Aug-19 01:02 PM] Lumbi#8378
buy @.25 sell at 3.50... EZ :3040_kingpeepo:

[06-Aug-19 01:02 PM] Caglio#3337
Lumbi, are you part of equalizer team ?

[06-Aug-19 01:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Who knows what happened to that eco project

[06-Aug-19 01:05 PM] Caglio#3337
Is this price drop of kmd gonna give us a bigger value

[06-Aug-19 01:05 PM] Caglio#3337
So we can get more eco projects to migrate here

[06-Aug-19 01:05 PM] Caglio#3337
We are much cheaper than ethereum

[06-Aug-19 01:05 PM] Caglio#3337
now 4 times cheaper than eos also

[06-Aug-19 01:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
Things happen to eco projects?

[06-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
I'z unaffiliated. The good thing about ecosystems are new ecosystems more impervious than the last... üòâ

[06-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Caglio#3337
I think we need electroneum to migrate to kmd platform

[06-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Caglio#3337
they had amazing marketing, and I am not even kidding

[06-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
father nature is a great teacher

[06-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Caglio#3337
I think we need a new hardfork into privacy coin again

[06-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Maybe thats where we failed

[06-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean we were zscash hardfork right, look at us

[06-Aug-19 01:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
We need to really get the message out to these mouth-breathing idiots out there that they are stupid if they don‚Äôt use KMD and all of its eco coins. Really shame people into adoption.

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Caglio#3337
we are having eco projects all around

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Caglio#3337
YES good idea mister meatspoon

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Caglio#3337
You have my vote

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
I mean, just bombard people with withering insults until they adopt

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Caglio if you want KMD to be removed from bitrex and binance, sure the team can fork, then you would complain about exchanges with no liquidity.

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Caglio#3337
After all I heard on this exact channel how eos sucks

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Caglio#3337
also neo

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Caglio#3337
kmd much much better

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Caglio#3337
i wont even talk about ethereum

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Caglio#3337
they cannot solve scalability problems

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Caglio#3337
we dont have those

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is, some people in the community not so much. They would rather waste time and take no responsibility for their investments.

[06-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Caglio#3337
No honestly

[06-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Caglio#3337
Its all my fault

[06-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Caglio#3337
I could have invested in in oyster pearl or something else

[06-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Caglio#3337
This is all on me

[06-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Caglio#3337
I am here for memery now

[06-Aug-19 01:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes that is what you should be telling yourself. No one held a gun to your head to invest.

[06-Aug-19 01:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Same as your reason not to sell

[06-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Caglio#3337
But honestly, you know how it goes, you come somewhere and listen to other people talk

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
BEST TECH!!

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Caglio#3337
If I just knew how amazing the marketing idea from the start was

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Caglio#3337
I would make sure noone ever invest in this

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes, but use that free time to do something. I hate this silly notion that if you dont get paid you wont do it. Well you are getting paid by increasing the worth of the coins you chose to buy.

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So suck it up and do something.

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Caglio#3337
There is no more going back

[06-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Caglio#3337
healthy stable market rejection

[06-Aug-19 01:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is like you are watching your house burn down, but instead of trying to put it out, you stand there and say, man i wish i didnt buy this house.

[06-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Caglio#3337
Is it my house really ?

[06-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Caglio#3337
From the day of investment everything changed around here

[06-Aug-19 01:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
It‚Äôs more like he is joking about it as it burns... not sure if that makes it better or worse.

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
from privacy coin we became platform

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
with some great projects

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
and some shitty ones

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
still most of the nerds here still shit about other coins

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
instead of being real

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
thats what grinds me up

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
maybe you should have been buying btc instead of smack in 2013. you're like my crackhead neighbor who's brain is so addled he yells to himself constantly but never really says anything.

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
How can I be like ur neighboor

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
i talk all the time here

[06-Aug-19 01:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Removing privacy because it wasnt private and risk of delisting from US exchanges......that is a hard choice

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Caglio#3337
but lets get back on the track with the hostility of komodo followers

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@meatspoon that implies he cannot do anything. People need to take responsibility over their own actions.

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`from privacy coin we became platform` I believe Komodo main goal was the latter and  not the former

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Caglio#3337
I heard people here shitting on every single coin

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Its just pure ignorance

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
u can talk about any coin and there will always be ppl hating it or defending it

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
the best tech memery is down the drain

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
even if that was true

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
which is obviously not

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
but even if it was true

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
the buissines model ( again about marketing )

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
is so fucking bad

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Its the worst ever

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Its pathetic and sad

[06-Aug-19 01:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`I heard people here shitting on every single coin` hasty generalization, a few do, not necessarily everyone
