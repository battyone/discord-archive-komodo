I see twitter "experts" saying re-orgs are evil, like good little sheep

[08-May-19 10:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
well- microforks of max 3 blocks  you mean?

[08-May-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
@LocoMB actually, what to you mean?

[08-May-19 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is no "3 block microfork rule", those are made up words

[08-May-19 10:19 AM] LocoMB#8593
'chain re-org ... are a core part of the protocol necessary for normal operation'

[08-May-19 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
Yes, what I said.

[08-May-19 10:19 AM] LocoMB#8593
I didn't mean rule - just that re-orgs happen all the time, with just a few blocks

[08-May-19 10:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
Correct

[08-May-19 10:21 AM] LocoMB#8593
with six block reorg being a liiiitle bit onthe high side for a healthy blockchain, as happened with VBK the other day üò∫ .. oh wait, or was it BSV?

[08-May-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. with big enough bribes to get majority hashrate mining the fork (before the stolen funds transferred), and sustained for a long enough time it could work, but would need to be started almost immediately after the theft. so unless the entire thing was fully orchestrated, there is no practical way

[08-May-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
for chains that are not the majority hashrate for an algo, reorgs of hundreds of blocks is not any problem

[08-May-19 10:21 AM] LocoMB#8593
* failry sure BSV had a six block reorg- because nodes started choking on those 128MB blocks

[08-May-19 10:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
Also agree with jl777

[08-May-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
BSV issues are not hashrate, but block propagation

[08-May-19 10:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
Doing a massive chain re-org *is* possible, but requires massive coordination immediately, the time is already past

[08-May-19 10:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
It's technically possible

[08-May-19 10:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
and LEGAL according to Satoshi's Vision, i.e. Bitcoin Protocol

[08-May-19 10:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
Every person saying it's "wrong" is wrong

[08-May-19 10:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
It's technically valid

[08-May-19 10:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
That is all we have.

[08-May-19 10:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Re-orgs are nothing bad if they happen for technical reasons... but a human made reorg to erase a transaction is worse than a 51% attack

[08-May-19 10:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
This is a 51% attack, yes.

[08-May-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if they can bribe the miners with enough funds, it is part of the protocol

[08-May-19 10:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am not arguing it's a great precedent, I am arguing that it is not "morally wrong" or whatever

[08-May-19 10:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Especially when it is to cover a rather not so bad loss fpr the hottest exchange in town

[08-May-19 10:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
We are just following the protocol

[08-May-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
whether its cool or no, is not the point. it is just possible

[08-May-19 10:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes. Possible doesnt mean it will make a bad precedent

[08-May-19 10:24 AM] Markus#5464
I think if they do this "rollback" of those transactions it will leave a bad taste for institutional investors of what is possible and what could happen to their funds

[08-May-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
99% of tx will just get reconfirmed

[08-May-19 10:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
Who cares about the feeling of institutional investors?

[08-May-19 10:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Actually i would assume price would rocket for btc if a rollback for recovering funds happen

[08-May-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody will notice anything really changed

[08-May-19 10:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
This is a "reorg", don't call it a "rollback"

[08-May-19 10:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
that assumes One True History

[08-May-19 10:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
and there is not such a thing

[08-May-19 10:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Other than the naming. I think big pockets from financial industry would like it. It would mean they could actually manipulate the chain which is something so far was thought as impossible for many

[08-May-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe somone will organize a coordinated "miner bribing" service so very rapidly stolen funds can be reclaimed, but it needs to be in place before the theft happens

{Reactions}
treasure 

[08-May-19 10:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Imo that is what pumped eth after the DAO hack

[08-May-19 10:30 AM] Markus#5464
if they decide to do the "reorg" which seem to be a important word to use. Lets say  the hacker spread those 7000 btc all over the place, used shapeshift and what not. Is that not going to affect quite alot of other things what could happen to innocent ppl not involved in what happened?

[08-May-19 10:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Shapeshift? Lol

[08-May-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the window of time to do it is well past

[08-May-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
now it is just delusional talk

[08-May-19 10:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Come on, that wont pass through any exvhange, that needs to be exchanged OTC

[08-May-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
semi-tech peoples using tech words without understanding

[08-May-19 10:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Youll be waiting a year or more to clear 7k btc on services like shapeshift, not mentioning the fact that it will put a crosshair in your forehead

[08-May-19 10:32 AM] Markus#5464
so CZ's "we got a few days" is not right?

[08-May-19 10:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nah, the reorg wont happen at this point

[08-May-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
like CSW saying he will kill ABC with a hashrate war, when the moment they forked, it was two different chains. neither could be killed

[08-May-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i would say a few blocks, a few hours at most, and that assumes you can get super majority of hashrate mining back from before the theft

[08-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so the miners are taking a big risk of not being able to catch up and mining for nothing

[08-May-19 10:34 AM] Markus#5464
Alright

[08-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
prepayments to compensate for hashrate, extra bribes in case they win, coordinated across all the major mining pools

[08-May-19 10:34 AM] Markus#5464
So they cant do anything about it anymore

[08-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
probably better chance for peace to break out in the middle east

[08-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
they never had any practical chanc

[08-May-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the only chance is if miners are prepared ahead of time

[08-May-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
which only works for internally coordinated hacks

[08-May-19 10:35 AM] Markus#5464
Okay

[08-May-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
like when CSW makes crazy claims

[08-May-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
dont worry BTC chain is safu

[08-May-19 10:38 AM] Tek#5253
whalebro at 19.2k now

[08-May-19 10:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
7k btc is not such a big deal imo

[08-May-19 10:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
$40million is almost spare change for binance

[08-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
a few days profits

[08-May-19 10:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A month of profits

[08-May-19 10:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, few days

not even close to gox, lost only 600k BTC

[08-May-19 11:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
200k*

[08-May-19 11:29 AM] Malti#3948
he was also probably still in denial phase of bad news, he will move on and accept the fact that it happened

[08-May-19 11:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He as in CZ?

[08-May-19 11:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If i was him i would shut up and cool down for a bit

[08-May-19 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Have a nice sleep, then structure a stratrgy and move on. Those tweets about reorgs look more like a sleepless desperate spoiled kid.

[08-May-19 11:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What is more funny about this is the meme of "decentralization" but then whrn you offer decentralized alternatives, people react like "do i have to download an app and manage keys myself? F**k that!"

[08-May-19 11:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im sure binance can do a SAFU coin IEO and raise more than $40m

1/ So when the news of the hack of Binance originally came across the scanners, I decided to delve into the TX ID provided to us. 

Since I don't have access to any blockchain software, I had to roll my sleeves up and figure this out the old fashioned way.

[08-May-19 11:53 AM] Acura#2748
interesting thread

[08-May-19 11:54 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i think the issue right now is that using these decentralized alternatives, both from a GUI perspective and technical perspective, is a bit confusing and difficult for most people

[08-May-19 11:54 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
theres a lack of clear, simple, assume-i-dont-know-anything directions, and the GUIs leave a lot to be desired

[08-May-19 11:55 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
as these issues are fixed, and as more people understand the technological jargon, usage of these alternatives should go up

8/ However, we see that address as part of a much larger bundle of TXs that are sending funds back to Binance's hot wallet directly. Which, to me, provides *significant* proof that this probably wasn't a hack but rather Binance just screwing up.

[08-May-19 11:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hack or huge human fuckup?

[08-May-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
internal messup seems like a reasonable theory

[08-May-19 12:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
simplest explanation seems to be a "messup" but a very clever inside player could try to cover their tracks by making something look like a messup. The larger organization will want to cover up the details, even tho they were not complicit. Wheels within wheels...

[08-May-19 12:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
"Judge, it wasn't me, it was the cronjob that sent 7000BTC, honest!"

[08-May-19 12:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
very hard to prove these kinds of things, who actually pushed the button. I don't envy the job of courts trying to figure this stuff out
