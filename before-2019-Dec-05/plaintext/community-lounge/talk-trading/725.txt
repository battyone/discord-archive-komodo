@jl777c can we get a gorilla marketing channel made in community lounge?

[03-Jun-19 09:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Or maybe community marketing üòõ

[03-Jun-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you want to market gorillas?

[03-Jun-19 09:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will be renting them out to carry everyone's kmd bags üòÑ

[03-Jun-19 09:08 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Great üòÉ

[03-Jun-19 09:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I am looking for people that watch crypto youtubers like cryptorus etc and have access to a google account to make donations from. #talk-marketing  come into this channel, i would like to hire some gorillas to do some marketing

[03-Jun-19 09:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will fund the donations, but need someone to help organize people towards this effort. I have seen people go crazy for $5/$10 donations, seems like a cheap way to get a few eye balls on us

i can get few eyeballs on you for some low money ( :

[03-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Caglio#3337
@hyperDEX but certainly not 5$

[03-Jun-19 09:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Exactly so the donations will have a greater return than say paying a youtuber to review us for $5k

[03-Jun-19 09:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We are sowing the seeds as it were

[03-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Caglio#3337
i can get you more exposure for less money

[03-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Caglio#3337
and im being serious

[03-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Caglio#3337
no YouTube tho

[03-Jun-19 09:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Come into #talk-marketing or dm me

[03-Jun-19 09:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This will be a community marketing effort independent from  the teams work

[03-Jun-19 09:23 PM] Caglio#3337

need to break 20/21k

[03-Jun-19 09:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Komodo is def worth at least 75 k-100 k sats .

[03-Jun-19 09:45 PM] Buddz1993#5380
The boost needed is arriving to push it foward

Yea KMD should easily break ATH imo with all that it has going for it now that products are working and functional. It was worth 75-100k sats without even being fully completed haha

[03-Jun-19 09:47 PM] dxer666#8963
we can go to the moon

This technology is what others are still ico/ieo‚Äôing for

[03-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
But now there‚Äôs a reason to be worth 75-100 k sats

[03-Jun-19 09:50 PM] cipi#4502
@Gordon Komodo 
```KMD/BTC size 250 bid 0.0001907 ask 0.0001931
KMD/BTC size 125 bid 0.0001908 ask 0.0001930
KMD/BTC size 050 bid 0.0001909 ask 0.0001929```
problem atm is that the bid from the whale is too close to the last traded price and i have set a minmargin of 0.5%, so my bids are below his... bot is taking a short brake üòÉ

@richardt I believe superNET sold waves holdings for kmd!

[04-Jun-19 06:04 AM] CHMEX#0686
also iota are now sold for kmd and btc as it looks

[04-Jun-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
I have a good feeling about KMD

[04-Jun-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
separately, I have another recommendation to make.

[04-Jun-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
remember the last one I recommended was PIRATE when it was around 3 to 5 cents, a couple months ago

[04-Jun-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if nobody is interested, i guess i will wait till later

VRSC is suffering from 1/tech

[04-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but now that their pbaas is in testing and almost done, the marketing for it will start

[04-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no halving, but it changing from dev mode to released and marketing, it should be a significant effect, especially with the low volumes

[04-Jun-19 06:18 AM] bishop#9773
There should be another halving in 15 months give or take

[04-Jun-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i think digitalprice is where it is most liquid and it isnt on CMC yet, there is some chance digitalprice will get on CMC, and if that happens, so should VRSC

[04-Jun-19 06:19 AM] bishop#9773
DP definitely is the most liquid for it, no doubt about that.

[04-Jun-19 06:20 AM] bishop#9773
Only when DP has a readily assessable api will CMC even think about adding them.

[04-Jun-19 06:20 AM] bishop#9773
which kinda sucks when you think about how far ahead they were to do zaddrs

[04-Jun-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i heard they made the api last week

[04-Jun-19 06:21 AM] bishop#9773
