@Keppie above bar shows 62%?

[26-Jun-19 06:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
64% ish could be the top to my feeling

[26-Jun-19 06:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
that'll be a hell of a thing to wake up to

[26-Jun-19 06:45 AM] Keppie#5156

[26-Jun-19 06:52 AM] Keppie#5156
I Don't like to compare bullruns, rarely the same pattern

[26-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Keppie#5156

[26-Jun-19 07:02 AM] Malti#3948
Is mainstream media already reporting something?

[26-Jun-19 07:04 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Damn didnt think kmd would go to 10k its going yo get even lower.

[26-Jun-19 07:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
all alts will get murdered temporarily. this is probably the biggest buying opportunity there is gonna be for awhile.

this is where the buy red alt, sell green alt game starts again.

I haven't been here for the short time üí∞ and I expected it to be the case for most at this point

[26-Jun-19 07:16 AM] Bittersweet#9376
but some are still selling

[26-Jun-19 07:17 AM] Sherdogz#6731
@actionslacks is this a strategy? ü§î

[26-Jun-19 07:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
@Sherdogz yeah, i'm gonna tweak it this time though. no more reading whitepapers, i will choose to invest in projects with the most marketing and the least tech

[26-Jun-19 07:21 AM] Keppie#5156
Volume tells me it's the same bots that are selling

[26-Jun-19 07:21 AM] Keppie#5156
USD bots

[26-Jun-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep, well what can you do.

[26-Jun-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Might have bought KMD when it was 0.5 USD and still a profit

[26-Jun-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Bots dont care about BTC value

[26-Jun-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But i am probably saying that to console myself so might be biased hahah, though there is no way i will be selling üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Fiat --> BTC --> more KMD at the moment

[26-Jun-19 07:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
buckle up, this ride stops for no one.

[26-Jun-19 07:59 AM] willofleo#7505

[26-Jun-19 07:59 AM] willofleo#7505
or an island

[26-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Malti#3948
just remember that alt-season last time also was the indicator for bear to start afterwards

[26-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Malti#3948
so if you start seeiing 'tittiecoin' do 100%'s

[26-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Malti#3948
time to take profits imo

i cant sleep. maybe big money is going to pour into this space... maybe blockchains will actually be utilized, not just speculated upon.

[26-Jun-19 08:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe we drop down to 3k tomorrow üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 08:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what you guys did to bitcoin while I went to sleep?

[26-Jun-19 08:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is what the bots did to KMD üòõ

1/ Bitcoin was supposed to be Anonymous Digital Cash. It turned out to be pseudo-anonymous later since identity could be linked to the transactions. We can now forget pseudo-anonyimity on $BTC as chain analysis is here.

[26-Jun-19 09:04 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
What is everyone‚Äôs expectations for an alt rally? (Say Btc smashes through ath) I know a lot of people are waiting and anticipating, but also that people won‚Äôt (hopefully) be buying all shitcoins and pumping the most useless alts. I‚Äôd imagine we have quite a lot more  veterened or informed investors compared to last time. 

Will we see a similar all alts up scenario, or more fundamentally solid alts going up mainly? If Btc reaches say 40k, do you presume that alts will go higher than 2017?

[26-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I‚Äôm still all alt and no Btc, and I‚Äôve lost 70% in Btc value in the last few days alone üòÇ to buy Btc now or to wait for alt season which may never come is the question

[26-Jun-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
things tend to go back to the average, 60%+ dominance is the extreme. when BTC pauses (or even corrects), funds will flow into the higher marketcap alts first, then down the line. that is the usual pattern, with occasional random pumps thrown in for fun

[26-Jun-19 09:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BTC Dominance:  61.8%

[26-Jun-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
going up 0.1% in a day is not good for alt satoshi price. up 2% in a day....

[26-Jun-19 09:12 AM] coingirl87#6489
There is no altcoin bear market...91 coins of top 100 on coinmarketcap perfored better than kmd....there is only a kmd bear narket...i think in 2 weeks we can say goodbye top100

[26-Jun-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the fiat bots will keep pushing the price down as long as people keep selling to it

[26-Jun-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i think KMD is suffering proportionally more as it has lower liquidity than average

[26-Jun-19 09:16 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...because of missing marketing in last years üôà

[26-Jun-19 09:17 AM] coingirl87#6489
Without marketing no liquidity

[26-Jun-19 09:17 AM] coingirl87#6489
No liquidity means no use

[26-Jun-19 09:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@coingirl87 There is only 6 degrees of separation between you and someone that can make a difference to the kmd price

Kmd marketing is not really good....see coinmarketcap..from 43 to 66

[26-Jun-19 09:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats not because of bear

[26-Jun-19 09:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It can be back in top 40 after 1 day

[26-Jun-19 09:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
Its because of no one known komodo

[26-Jun-19 09:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why not dump then it can only go lower
