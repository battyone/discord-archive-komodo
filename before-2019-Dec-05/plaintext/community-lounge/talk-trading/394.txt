But a testnet is optimized for a specific task

[01-Feb-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
real life conditions with other stuff happening on chain

[01-Feb-19 01:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How can a test net be proven to be secure when attackers dont have financial incentive to attack the chain?

[01-Feb-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[01-Feb-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
But you know what I mean.

[01-Feb-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If KMD reaches 0.1 BTC, then a lot more people will know what I *really* think of them :troll_king:

I feel like that order absorbed maybe 8ish btc worth @1800 looks like some more  has been added  lol maybe its coming from elsewhere tho.

[01-Feb-19 04:49 PM] Tek#5253
despite the 5% stake reward not many people seem to be selling KMD

[01-Feb-19 04:52 PM] Alecandro#1179
that's good! demand > supply

it'll be nice once 0.00027 gets flipped  and also as komodo ecosystem is growing I will be really interested to see its reaction to 0.00047 when it gets there.

[01-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea I think we will be surpassing our old ATH in next bull market

[01-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
going to continue adding business partners and revenue streams

[01-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Alecandro#1179
the coinbene partnership is exciting because they should be recommending our dpow tech solution to blochains vulnerable to 51% attacks as I understand it

[01-Feb-19 04:57 PM] Tek#5253
Another big order popped up

[01-Feb-19 04:57 PM] Tek#5253
10btc worth

[01-Feb-19 04:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
I will preface this comment by saying I think dpow is a cool idea.  But the economics of it don't make much sense to me.  If memory serves, projects were being charged 100 kmd per year to notarize.  Even if the prices of dpow got 10x'd and projects were charged 1000 kmd and lets say 1000 projects chose to use KMD.  That is still only 1,000,000 KMD per year.    With a circulating supply of over 111 million, that is less than 1%.  That is unlikely to put any upward pressure on KMD price at all.  Kind of a non-event for KMD investors.

[01-Feb-19 04:59 PM] Alecandro#1179
sweeet

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
and that scenario is the "wildly successful" scenario.  1000 projects are not going to use dpow

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Alecandro#1179
well, don't you think having multiple sources of income is good?

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Tek#5253
@meatspoon interesting, but then again look at XRP, what tokeconomics does that have

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Alecandro#1179
dpow isnt the only thing KMD has to offer

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
XRP is a shitcoin, yes?

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Tek#5253
yeah

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Tek#5253
but it still mooned a million percent

[01-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Tek#5253
or what

[01-Feb-19 05:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
that isnt really an argument, tho, Tek.  I am not concerned about shitcoins.

[01-Feb-19 05:01 PM] Tek#5253
tokeniconomics don't really matter is what I'm trying to say

[01-Feb-19 05:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Any given coin can moon for no good reason

[01-Feb-19 05:01 PM] Tek#5253
ok they do

[01-Feb-19 05:01 PM] Tek#5253
but less than you think probably

[01-Feb-19 05:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
and I know dpow isnt the only thing KMD has to offer.  Of course not.  But when people reference it as a game-changer, well, i think its a cool service but for us KMD investors it wont move the needle

[01-Feb-19 05:03 PM] Tek#5253
KMD and RLC : tokeniconomics not really clear but still good projects

[01-Feb-19 05:03 PM] Alecandro#1179
but just even on a completely separate note here, do average investors look into dpow and do the math to figure out how much the KMD team will make annually? Or will they see a really cool security feature that is just one of many other things KMD has to offer

[01-Feb-19 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
XRP has really cool functional features...  but its a crappy investment, right?

[01-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Tek#5253
very

[01-Feb-19 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
so the token economics have to be there.

[01-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Tek#5253
I use it between exchanges sometimes

[01-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Tek#5253
that's it

[01-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Alecandro#1179
In other news, the 10BTC buy order is at 18.7K now

[01-Feb-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
think this will start a war between the 100btc bull and the 10btc bull?

[01-Feb-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
or IS HE THE SAME

[01-Feb-19 05:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
XRP works well for banks.  the features are cool for banks.  But the supply is ridiculously huge and ownership is very centralized.  so the token economics suck

[01-Feb-19 05:05 PM] Alecandro#1179
intersting. could be a distraction technique haha

[01-Feb-19 05:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
and speaking of dpow, is there anything at all from stopping any other project from just appropriating the concept and making their own dpow?

[01-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Tek#5253
i've also read about  xrp being a utility token as in, you can send a few million worth of value with maybe 5 xrp

[01-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@meatspoon as far as I understand it would be possible

[01-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but that would take a very deep understanding of ALL the kmd code

[01-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and need to rewrite a looooot of code

[01-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as the whole kmd ecosystem is so embedded in all the dpow code

[01-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Alecandro#1179
And paying for the network tansaction fees each year

[01-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Alecandro#1179
which KMD spends apparently like 180 BTC/year on

[01-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Alecandro#1179
so its not cheap

[01-Feb-19 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
right.  i dont think it will get appropriated because the economics arent really there.  but it could be.  someone could code their own solution to notarization.  and if there economics are there to make such a service profitable, you can bet your nips other projects will do it

[01-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Alecandro#1179
But that was part of the reason the KMD team did an ICO to raise money and hold 10% of the shares for marketing, fees , growth, etc.

[01-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Tek#5253
@meatspoon whats a project/coin with "great" tokeneconomics?

[01-Feb-19 05:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
well, i don't want to commit to "great".  I will get some grief from the BTC-haters, but limited supply, simple concept, low-ish inflation rate....

[01-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Tek#5253
so you are looking for a store of value?

[01-Feb-19 05:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
I like BCO.  No premine, no inflation, utility every 2 weeks with BTC, ETH and BCO payouts

[01-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Tek#5253
what do you think about NANO. it tickes all the boxes yo just said

[01-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Tek#5253
fully distributed, no inflation

[01-Feb-19 05:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
ALQO/XLQ will be good token economics if the exchange is launched and even remotely successful

[01-Feb-19 05:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
i havent dont my research on NANO, sorry

[01-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Buddz1993#5380
tbh A lot is uncertain right now.
