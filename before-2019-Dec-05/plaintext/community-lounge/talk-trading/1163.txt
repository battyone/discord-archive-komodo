we cant have that without a alt szn

[29-Sep-19 04:43 PM] Markus#5464
it does not have to happen right now but sooner or later it will üòÑ

[29-Sep-19 04:47 PM] Markus#5464
During 2018-2019 not including 2017 pump if u bought doge at 37 sats and below and sold at 81 sats u would of made minimum 250% gains against btc

[29-Sep-19 04:49 PM] Markus#5464
i use 81 sats in this example cause i can see its a number where it reached most of times on weekly so to me its a quite safe number according to how it behaved in the past

[29-Sep-19 05:09 PM] Neko#5830
I think it will happen again with most alts pumping by years end

[29-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Neko#5830
a repeat of 2017-2018

Much props to whoever becomes a millionaire trading doge, wow

@Markus not my comments, but the posts with unicorn pics my sarcastic comments were referring to

[29-Sep-19 06:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Cryptoon I deleted my unicorn message. I don't understand jokes or sarcasm sometimes.

Can someone point me to the right plebtangle to look at?

I'm getting confused. 8400 didnt work. 

Is this like elliot waves where I have to start the plebtangle count again?

[29-Sep-19 07:50 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
there are 1000 supernet for sale on coinexchange, if anybody interested

[29-Sep-19 07:52 PM] tolken#2655
I would, but then again you‚Äôre selling, which makes me think I should sell too. But then again maybe that was the plan all along. üòõ

[29-Sep-19 07:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I would have bought that if we were not in bear market üòÑ

[29-Sep-19 07:53 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
seller just needs some fund for emegencies

my portfolio is too down in value to take value from something else and move to something else.

There's some cheap DEX on mm2 (chainswap) as well

[29-Sep-19 08:22 PM] hastrup#8742
@Oszy yes I'm thinking of buying them :)

[29-Sep-19 08:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
how much for how many?

[29-Sep-19 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
68 DEX at 19.99777 KMD/DEX

[29-Sep-19 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
you can buy DEX at Chainswap

[29-Sep-19 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
(some self promotion doesn't harm here :abusedsmily: )

[29-Sep-19 08:42 PM] jorian#4555
and there's an additional order at 20 KMD/DEX for 47 DEX

[29-Sep-19 08:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh that 1000 supernet order from komodoworld is a solid offer

[29-Sep-19 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If I had the free funds I would be thinking of scooping the up

[29-Sep-19 08:48 PM] jorian#4555

he sell supernet for roughly 28.5 kmd a piece

[29-Sep-19 08:52 PM] jorian#4555
that doesn't count DEX, CRYPTO, HODL, MSHARK

[29-Sep-19 08:54 PM] jorian#4555
seeing you can buy only 11 SUPERNET on atomicdex for 50 KMD/SUPERNET

[29-Sep-19 08:55 PM] Markus#5464
I think i would stay with KMD if u look for value, the share u get from 1000 supernet compared to value gain from 28500 kmd not sure its worth it

[29-Sep-19 08:57 PM] Markus#5464
might be worth if u later on manage to flip them on atomicdex at a higher rate tho

[29-Sep-19 09:29 PM] venne#4038
tempting to buy some kmd at these prices

We have volunteered to join Binance‚Äôs liquidity consolidation exercise, by removing NPXS/BTC trading pair and keeping NPXS/ETH, NPXS/USDC, NPXS/USDT pairings in Binance Exchange. We hope this exercise will bring greater growth and liquidity for #NPXS. https://t.co/uq91KS...

[30-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Oszy#5734
the only thing i can think of is delisting btc pair might help to stabilize price when fiat pegged bots dumping when btc price jumping around

[30-Sep-19 07:06 AM] Oszy#5734
we saw it happen sometimes on kmd but it's not as bad that we should delist btc pair üòÑ maybe they think this is good for them, idk

[30-Sep-19 07:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true üòÖ

[30-Sep-19 07:06 AM] Oszy#5734
on the other hand i'd love to see USDT pair for KMD on binance

if coin price stability is their concern then it's even bad than a bandaid type of action üòÑ

[30-Sep-19 07:08 AM] Oszy#5734
idk what their goal is, it's a rank 69 (lol) coin with 235 billion supply and a price of 3-4 sats...

Every CEX runs that risk

‚ÄúAll the tokens have the same intrinsic value; zero. They make them seem to be worth different amounts and then dump them to traders they lure in with their marketing. They are only pretending to be making profit on trading margin, they are really buying and selling to innocents who do not know this is all rigged against them.‚Äù
