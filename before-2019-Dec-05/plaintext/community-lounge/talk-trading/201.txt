[13-Oct-18 07:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
weird that he's set a donations goal for vertcoin, but then says he will attack an even bigger coin if he does NOT meet goal
something is not adding up

[13-Oct-18 07:30 PM] Acura#2748
I only found Polo and Bittrex for EMC2 🧐

[13-Oct-18 07:32 PM] Buddz1993#5380
hes most likely to fail rather than succeed but lets wait and see what he does.

[13-Oct-18 07:32 PM] snowdamn#2414
maybe getting donations is all that's to it

what's the most an attacker can do between a coin's block and BTC block notarization?

[13-Oct-18 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
convincing someone to swap for value very quickly and withdraw it

[13-Oct-18 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is on the KMD notarization that things get pretty locked down

[13-Oct-18 08:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
awesome
