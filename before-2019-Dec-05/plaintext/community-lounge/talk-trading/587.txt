As long as the selloffs are low volume and the gains are high volume, we’re good

[27-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362

```Reuters reported that the mainstream adoption of all types of digital assets would depend mainly on their ability to gain global regulation. As central governing bodies don’t control most digital assets, it is necessary to have a way of tracking transactions as they are conducted to curb any trafficking and terrorist financing efforts.```

```Jolly Roger

A pirate flag depicting a skull-and-crossbones. It was an invitation to surrender, with the implication that those who surrendered would be treated well. A red flag indicated "no quarter."
