greek too

[12-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Alecandro#1179
just a friendly reminder that KMD/btc pair on DP is at 17k lol

[12-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Alecandro#1179
buy side anyway

[12-Jun-19 02:38 PM] jorian#4555
you can't move KMD, so arbitrage isn't really possible

[12-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Alecandro#1179
butttttt, you can buy cheaper 😃

[12-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jorian#4555
maybe DP is the real price

[12-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jorian#4555
binance is not an open market right now

[12-Jun-19 02:52 PM] p.#1126
dp the real price :troll_lol:

[12-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
🤷🏻‍♂️

[12-Jun-19 03:34 PM] grumpygoron#4320
KMD’s price behavior has me excited

You know I have been thinking

[12-Jun-19 04:00 PM] 차미숙#8912
Some peeps work their ass off to earn like 100 dollars per day

[12-Jun-19 04:00 PM] 차미숙#8912
And I'm sitting here going crypto

[12-Jun-19 04:01 PM] 차미숙#8912
Man.. people gotta learn like proper econ

[12-Jun-19 04:02 PM] grumpygoron#4320
If everyone learned proper Econ it wouldn’t be as profitable anymore.  Then we’d have a society so in demand of hard labor or even McDonalds workers that that would be the new avenue for getting rich

[12-Jun-19 04:03 PM] 차미숙#8912
Well

[12-Jun-19 04:03 PM] 차미숙#8912
Actually hard labor on crypto is pretty profitable

[12-Jun-19 04:03 PM] 차미숙#8912
Although there are some risks associated to it

[12-Jun-19 04:04 PM] 차미숙#8912
I see peeps spending like 3 years trying to be a government official

[12-Jun-19 04:05 PM] 차미숙#8912
Which is like $30000 salary

[12-Jun-19 04:05 PM] 차미숙#8912
And the currency itself is getting devalued so much

[12-Jun-19 04:05 PM] 차미숙#8912
So less and less purchasing power as time goes

[12-Jun-19 04:06 PM] 차미숙#8912
And on the other hand there are crypto peeps just sucking their brains out

[12-Jun-19 04:06 PM] 차미숙#8912
And they work all day and I aint

[12-Jun-19 04:06 PM] 차미숙#8912
Weird world we live in

[12-Jun-19 04:07 PM] 차미숙#8912
All caused by higher taxes higher regulation higher govt spending

`If everyone learned proper Econ it wouldn’t be as profitable anymore. `

[12-Jun-19 04:31 PM] jorian#4555

[12-Jun-19 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Jun-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
everyone else in debt, has no money

[12-Jun-19 04:40 PM] 차미숙#8912
Just wait until you buy a property with no debt

[12-Jun-19 04:40 PM] 차미숙#8912
People look at you like who is this mofo

[12-Jun-19 04:40 PM] 차미숙#8912
All cash

[12-Jun-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have to pay for this one first 😅

[12-Jun-19 04:59 PM] 차미숙#8912
Bitcoin is gonna be so bull again soon

[12-Jun-19 04:59 PM] 차미숙#8912
The million dollar question is if alts are too in satoshis

[12-Jun-19 05:00 PM] jorian#4555
BTC is king

[12-Jun-19 05:05 PM] 차미숙#8912
One day, your grandson will ask you, "grandpa, why did you not buy more bitcoin"

[12-Jun-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you mean "why did you sell so much of it" 🤣

[12-Jun-19 05:08 PM] dsalinas79#8160
What price do you think KMD can reach next year?

[12-Jun-19 05:09 PM] 차미숙#8912
I keep repeating it and i will say again

[12-Jun-19 05:09 PM] 차미숙#8912
It does not matter what the price is

[12-Jun-19 05:10 PM] 차미숙#8912
The most important decision you can make right now is to get rid of your fiat

[12-Jun-19 05:10 PM] 차미숙#8912
Dumping fiat is the point

[12-Jun-19 05:20 PM] dan.#2473
fiat aint goin away

[12-Jun-19 05:20 PM] 차미숙#8912
It aint

[12-Jun-19 05:20 PM] 차미숙#8912
Who says it's going away

[12-Jun-19 05:21 PM] 차미숙#8912
Your purchasing power is going away

[12-Jun-19 05:28 PM] jorian#4555
a bitcoin dump of 10% does more with my purchasing power than the slowbleed of fiat inflation :abusedsmily:

[12-Jun-19 06:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
not the smartest AI 😂

[12-Jun-19 06:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
on the right charts you can force them up or down with heaps of micro orders till they get to the price you want to buy or sell at

[12-Jun-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that should happen more often

[12-Jun-19 07:55 PM] JimD#9272
it had to go down

[12-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I understand you lost & won a few fortunes as well... yet you are still here (I suppose)... death is just too final...

[12-Jun-19 07:58 PM] jansako#3330
now he not gonna learn...

[12-Jun-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako I worked within my means and was never dumb enough to leverage anything I couldn't afford to lose (except a house once, but that's a story on quad 2s dying to quad As, so 🤷🏽 )

[12-Jun-19 07:59 PM] jansako#3330
he only lost what he could not afford once too (maybe not, of course)

[12-Jun-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he stole it, he couldn't afford any of it

[12-Jun-19 08:00 PM] jansako#3330
now he wont return it either

[12-Jun-19 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

You only die once

[12-Jun-19 08:02 PM] jansako#3330
ah, right... then again, maybe he was a buddhist & will come back again so no big deal for him...

[12-Jun-19 08:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is kind of sad, the investors will becoming for his family now

[12-Jun-19 08:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I bet you anything that he had lost most of it before putting 100x

[12-Jun-19 08:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[12-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Markus#5464

[12-Jun-19 08:31 PM] cipi#4502
does not look like he could sell 18,900 BTC on coinbase, volume is too low there: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets
