Bitcoin won't be useful in a world where blockchain has become mainstream, but there's a good chance that the coin that's going to be mainstream is connected closely to bitcoin, hopefully that's Komodo.

There was some evidence of panic selling today with the first 90% downside day of the year (over 90% of NYSE total volume was in declining shares).

[Bakkt Implications] 

- Bakkt is a game changer that will bring in institutional funds. According to a recent Fidelity survey of 411 U.S. institutional investors, 47 percent of respondents said they were willing to include cryptocurrency in their investment portfolio. Most institutional investors are interested in bitcoin. You have to give up a lot to make it look like a ripple.

- Unless you're a single-shot trader, I'd like to stop distributed investment in cryptocurrency as much as possible. There may be a Coin that will grow like Amazon in 10 years, but I think the smartest investment is to have a portfolio of cryptocurrency as bitcoin only. It seems desirable to invest 5-10 percent of all assets in Bitcoin and allocate the rest to other asset groups such as stocks, cash, gold and real estate.

- NASDAQ was also paying attention to the real-life acquisition of Eris X, so I'm sure we'll speed up the launch of Bitcoin-related services.

- Recent price surges are assumed to be Wall Street forces' front runs, pre-received backt approval information. 

- When Wall Street-trusted financial institutions launch Bitcoin trading platforms and build trust, Bitcoin ETF approval is only a matter of time.

- It's bitcoin, not Altcoin, that big companies or governments are interested in. As time goes by, I think Bitcoin's total share of cryptocurrency transactions will continue to rise and many Altcoans will disappear. 

- The U.S. will have a lot of bitcoin in its own country and will try to prepare for the upcoming currency war. Gold and Bitcoin. Many countries can take the lead on the negotiating table. 

- With the active participation of large companies, bitcoins are going through a confidence-building phase. Bitcoin, which is digital gold, gives economic independence to the underprivileged.

the anal probe on Bitstamp continues, I hope they're happy with new docs I sent. I will use Bitpanda next time

[14-May-19 08:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
On kraken you get better rates and also costless 1 day SEPA wire transfers

[14-May-19 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
panda very user friendly though, so I guess it's a tradeoff

[14-May-19 08:04 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm registered on Kraken, but found my account temporarily disabled after not using for a long time. I just wrote to support

[14-May-19 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Last time I wrote support I lost my 2FA masterkey, I remember them answering very quickly, but as I was using other exchanges in the meantime never got around to fixing it... Should probably write them again üôà
