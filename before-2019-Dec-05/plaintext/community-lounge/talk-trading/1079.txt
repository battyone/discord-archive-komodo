investing in alt coins 2019 might have been the worst investment

[16-Aug-19 07:39 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Dude you was so bullish last week

[16-Aug-19 07:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[16-Aug-19 07:40 PM] Markus#5464
Iam a hidden bull but man it hurts to see kmd get rekt like its worth nothing at all

[16-Aug-19 07:40 PM] Markus#5464
so at this point it can for sure hit 3k i dont see why it would not

[16-Aug-19 07:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's a bit brutal yes

[16-Aug-19 07:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I see the possibility

[16-Aug-19 07:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But between 5-6k I hope for better times

[16-Aug-19 07:41 PM] Markus#5464
cause it looks like btc is having fun ranging 1000$ up down in 1 single day, pretty legit and so on

[16-Aug-19 07:42 PM] Markus#5464
opens up 10300, goes down to 9700 then back up to 10500 i mean rly are u okay bro?

[16-Aug-19 07:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's quite bipolar market right now

[16-Aug-19 07:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Atleast it's not boring eh ?? üòÇ

[16-Aug-19 07:43 PM] Markus#5464
for sure not üòÑ

[16-Aug-19 07:43 PM] Markus#5464
well alt market is

[16-Aug-19 07:44 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Eventually it will rise , unless whales have forsaken us , or better say the opportunity to pump coins 100 % in a day

[16-Aug-19 07:45 PM] richardt#2807
KMD now pegged at $0.80 while BTC dances around.  Awesome

[16-Aug-19 07:45 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
50 cents allin

[16-Aug-19 07:45 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@richardt

[16-Aug-19 07:45 PM] richardt#2807
Will definitely buy back more when it goes $0.50 or lower üòÑ

[16-Aug-19 08:56 PM] hastrup#8742
@Markus it was lower back in December. I'm just waiting for that sweet 0.50 cent again I did not buy enough back then but this time I'm going all in, can't wait.!!
Look at it like this.
We are still two to three years from Mildly mass adoption.
The tech, brains the right people here. But it is still a gamble to think kmd will be here after the dust have settle. There is a good chance kmd and some few others still be here. Delivering amazing tech as always. My biggest concern is the crypto space especially kmd because of the Decentral nature of it is going to be regulated to death. Yes there is a market for it and ppl will use it but like kazar Napster lime wire and tpb was mega huge back in the 00 but now not so much now. What do you guys think? Will komodo be just another tpb?

[16-Aug-19 08:59 PM] Markus#5464
In my opinion KMD itself should only focus on tech and to build new things and have a company to focus only on promoting it nothing else

[16-Aug-19 09:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That is what has been forming

[16-Aug-19 09:00 PM] Markus#5464
but who is going to promote it?

[16-Aug-19 09:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Kmd will remain an open source project as it always has been.   A company has been formed to be able to take on clients and to leverage our network of professionals for Komodo related work.   When it is ready to be public it will but in the meantime just getting all the things in place to be able to interact with the conventional world.

[16-Aug-19 09:04 PM] Markus#5464
I think it would be amazing if KMD had 1 person who is very skilled when it comes to communicating with ppl and know  how to talk infront of ppl, this persons job would be to travel around the world and attend crypto related events non stop

[16-Aug-19 09:04 PM] hastrup#8742
Benny?

[16-Aug-19 09:05 PM] Markus#5464
isnt Benny busy with RFox now

[16-Aug-19 09:05 PM] hastrup#8742
And kmd he is using kmd tech

[16-Aug-19 09:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Presenting at conferences is draining,  most of the networking is done on the floor anyway.

[16-Aug-19 09:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not an easy position to fill

[16-Aug-19 09:07 PM] Markus#5464
Im not very sure how such events work but i could imagine that it would be a shortcut to create potential partnerships if there is larger companies interested in new tech

[16-Aug-19 09:07 PM] Markus#5464
that attend those events

[16-Aug-19 09:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Its about fulfilling those requests.  Ive spoken at around a dozen crypto events for Komodo.  Getting interested parties isnt the issue, fulfilling their needs is.   And while Komodo is making in roads to newbie developer friendliness,  most projects tend to underestimate there developer needs and even with our service providers  there is not enough Komodo specific hired help available to tackle large projects.

[16-Aug-19 09:13 PM] Markus#5464
Also another thing im sure will put more clearance into KMD's tech would be to make simplified videos that compare and explain why things solve current problems, for example at this moment when it comes to AtomicDEX it just shows u can use it on mobile, you can store your crypto in the same app and u can also trade using new technology. I think a explainer video with comparing how a centralized exchange work compared to how AtomicDEX work would make ppl think and view it in a different way

[16-Aug-19 09:13 PM] Markus#5464
with cons and pros

[16-Aug-19 09:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I have enough work to keep all of our service providers busy for years if necessary but until the tech has hardened for production use, just have to work on other aspects of adoption.    @Markus  I believe marketing team is looking at making videos

Ye i dont doubt that new ideas for kmd team ever gonna be a problem üôÇ Just wanted to bring some thoughts i had incase it would bring new ideas what already had not been thought of üòÑ

[16-Aug-19 09:18 PM] Markus#5464
@polycryptoblog so u mean the issue atm is that kmd need more devs to build up the ecosystem?

[16-Aug-19 09:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
devs and other contributors

[16-Aug-19 09:19 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[16-Aug-19 09:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Writers, video makers,  ambassadors,  list goes on  however a proper incentive scheme needs to be discussed

[16-Aug-19 09:23 PM] Markus#5464
There were before weekly updates about on going progress of new tech being developed what happened with those

[16-Aug-19 09:23 PM] Markus#5464
I feel like Official is being less used now a days

[16-Aug-19 09:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
and need tech to mature which takes time.   Example have 3 Trading tools right now interested in AtomicAPI  but the API needs to be beta tested thoroughly.     The Marketing still releases a newsletter,  I believe tech tuesdays have been included together with that.

[16-Aug-19 09:27 PM] Markus#5464
Does tradingview include in those 3? or cant tell at this moment?

[16-Aug-19 09:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No it is not yet.

[16-Aug-19 09:28 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[16-Aug-19 11:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
We are going to burn 0.76% of total Hush supply, and I guess I am interested to hear what this room thinks of that: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1162510288069038087

Ethical Transparency in Hush v3: https://t.co/nLqvrDabL6
TLDR: We will be provably burning (via OP_RETURN) 160,000 $HUSH which is 0.76% of total supply (160K of 21M). These funds were originally stolen by a Cryptopia 51% attacker before #DPoW was deployed to our v2 mainnet.

[17-Aug-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
y'all so friendly. I expect there to be lots of misunderstanding and dislike of some things, and that is why we are doing it all in the open, so later on nobody can accuse us of nefarious things (but they still will)

[17-Aug-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am mostly excited because I am learning more about provably burning coins, and using @Alright's new code to do it

{Reactions}
shexy 

[17-Aug-19 02:38 PM] joe2x4#5987
So burning 160,000 random coins = burning premine, which is different coins. Am I missing something?

[17-Aug-19 02:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah, who (still) owns the premine? and where did the burned coins come from?

[17-Aug-19 02:46 PM] tolken#2655
@dukeleto just make sure you use the right decimal point.

[17-Aug-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@joe2x4 we are burning an amount equal to the premine, but we never had access to the actual pre-mine coins. These funds come from Cryptopia 51% attacker

proper opreturn burn rpc command by Alrighttt ¬∑ Pull Request #167...
This removes the extra unnecessary vout, adds option to change txfee, adds help information and removes the oracles eval code dependency.

[17-Aug-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@LocoMB the original pre-mine was sold and paid out to Hush members before I joined the team. As far as I can tell, most of the pre-mine was sold for project expenses in 2017/2018. Some former Hush people got a salary of something like 2000HUSH/month, paid from that original premined funds. I never received any of that money

[17-Aug-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@LocoMB the current funds, which we are burning, came from the 51% attacker on Cryptopia

[17-Aug-19 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
I made a new Hush mainnet and did not airdrop the attacker funds to the new chain. Then everyone got to choose which chain they wanted to be on

[17-Aug-19 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have control of those funds currently, which means I can burn funds/etc. This is because I created the new Hush mainnet

[17-Aug-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
When you make a new AC, and you use -ac_supply > 0, then in block 1 you get those coins. I airdropped all balances except to the attacker. The old chain was never turned off, it was as decentralized as you can get

[17-Aug-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
People finally stopped mining that old chain a few months ago

@Deleted User if you can do some testing, to see how stuff renders on explorers, that would be super useful üòâ

[17-Aug-19 03:00 PM] joe2x4#5987
No complaints from me. This is not the first time though that a project with new leadership has attempted to address a premine in this mannor. Not sure the world really cares about premines though. Just look at Darkcoin, total scammy behavior from day 1. Their Dev should have def gone to jail based on all the info people provided back in the day. Lots and lots and lots of manipulation. But as the old saying goes "fake it till you make it". They sure as hell faked it so hard they had to rebrand. What is that shit stain of a coin called now? Oh yeah, Dash.

@dukeleto im impressed how u and many other devs in here have so great blockchain knowledge, makes me want to learn myself

[17-Aug-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@joe2x4 mostly this is how we want to ensure that people in the future don't accuse of of backroom shenanigans with funds. Yes, it's totally boring, that is why it's called "transparency" üòâ

[17-Aug-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Markus well, it's my full-time job, I don't have any fiat wages to fall back to üôÇ  That is good motivation for me

[17-Aug-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@joe2x4 i know some people who are die-hard DASH fans, who are devs or marketing people for the DASH team. Hilarious when they fight with die-hard BTC core folks

[17-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Markus#5464
@dukeleto do u think blockchain in general is yet in a early stage? Would start learning about it now in that case make me have some sort of advantage in the technical part incase blockchain gets world adopted?

[17-Aug-19 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[17-Aug-19 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
Read the source code of Bitcoin, is my suggestion, then Komodo üôÇ

[17-Aug-19 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's a lot. Just dive in and read little pieces that interest you, and try to really understand it. Modify it, add some prints. Experiment

[17-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Markus#5464
What about reading kmds dev docs?

[17-Aug-19 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
sure, that is a good start

[17-Aug-19 03:22 PM] Markus#5464
Alright nice

[17-Aug-19 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
that will give you the 10,000ft picture. Reading the source code is like going to the holy texts in the basement üôÇ Not easy to read, but they are "canon"

[17-Aug-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think we haven't even seen the explosion of "blockchain coders", like we did for "web devs"

[17-Aug-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
not even close.

[17-Aug-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
What do u think is reason for this?

[17-Aug-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
Stuff barely works

[17-Aug-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
difficult curve being steeper?

[17-Aug-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
lots of vaporware, and many people just haven't learned about it yet. Many people think all Bitcion/cryptocoin stuff is a scam and not "real coding"

typical application level programmers wont make effective core devs

[17-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty much need OS devs. or specialists in parallel processing

[17-Aug-19 03:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Markus can also start with Mastering Bitcoin.

[17-Aug-19 03:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I started with that, but that too need some coding knowledge in languages like python or C/C++ and a bit of maths understanding around cryptography helps better.

[17-Aug-19 03:40 PM] Markus#5464
@grewalsatinder  Great, thanks ! Any good explaining documentation of cryptograph math?
