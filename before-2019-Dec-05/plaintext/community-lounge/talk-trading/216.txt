@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 they shot themselves in the foot to do KYC to get USD .......now they dont have USD or users LOL

[15-Oct-18 10:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@siu - Chainmakers 350BTC bid does that 😛

[15-Oct-18 10:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We just need him to move it to 18k and let it creep up again

[15-Oct-18 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hyperDEX KYC/AML was kinda out of their hands given where they all live and that none of them wanted to move their base of operations

[15-Oct-18 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Most of the trex shareholders live within a 40 mile radius of each other iirc

[15-Oct-18 10:06 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
My legacy account is useless since they could never confirm my purpose of existence. Luckly the account was empty so I have no reason to fight it.

[15-Oct-18 10:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I am sure allowing deposits on a frozen account was out of their hands too 😛

[15-Oct-18 10:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, some of that mess is debatable 😛

[15-Oct-18 10:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But it was their choice not to move the company and im sure they are regretting that

[15-Oct-18 10:08 PM] SHossain#0007
i thought @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 had hands in trex operations :trollface:

[15-Oct-18 10:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
They are all rich, I'm certain they regret nothing; if it all dies today, they retire and live sipping drinks on beaches

[15-Oct-18 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain I wish, I started in this space way to late for things like that

[15-Oct-18 10:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
I never got to test that 1337 btc withdrawal limit😔

[15-Oct-18 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, the problems of the poor man 👆🏼

I downloaded the Agama wallet and want to put my coins there how do I make my wallet safe before transferring from exchange?

[16-Oct-18 12:27 AM] Vertigo#0439
Take in to consideration I don't have any experience with private keys

[16-Oct-18 12:29 AM] Vertigo#0439
Oh NVM wrong channel

[16-Oct-18 12:58 AM] ryman112#0068
No worries

[16-Oct-18 04:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Our friend's 350BTC has moved to 18k on Binance @jl777c

[16-Oct-18 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly it is a fake buywall

[16-Oct-18 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it is going up by some set amount every so often? maybe it is a big bot?

[16-Oct-18 05:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
500 sats/12hours for the last day

[16-Oct-18 05:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Went from 17k to 18k now in the space of 24-30 hours

[16-Oct-18 05:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
17k then 17.5 and now 18

[16-Oct-18 05:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just need them to market buy to 50k 😛

[16-Oct-18 05:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
I wonder what would happen if somebody just fills it. Would it immediatly dump a big portion?

[16-Oct-18 05:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Probably will go back to 16k i would think

[16-Oct-18 05:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But hard to be buying 2% of a coin and not have plans for it

[16-Oct-18 05:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
I never undersood this wall games. Can it affect the price or people just talk about it?

[16-Oct-18 05:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well typically i have found people put up walls then pull it before filling or when it starts filling if they want to manipulate the price one way or another

[16-Oct-18 05:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If they let it get filled it usually means they really wanted the KMD LOL

[16-Oct-18 05:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Especially 350BTC worth

[16-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe this is a megawhale and 350 BTC to him is like 0.35 BTC for normal people?

[16-Oct-18 05:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[16-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking hollowman

[16-Oct-18 05:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahh

[16-Oct-18 05:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
Right he sold that 507 KMD for BTC two weeks ago needs a refill 😂

[16-Oct-18 05:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c i agree and think it must be @Hollowman9000 .

[16-Oct-18 05:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
If in doubt hollowman

[16-Oct-18 05:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It would be interesting....

[16-Oct-18 05:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Short term if the wall gets filled/pulled is price will probably slide down, if no one sells price will keep going up

[16-Oct-18 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt the whale even realize there isnt that much KMD deposited in binance?

[16-Oct-18 05:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or BTC moons and we are all rich

[16-Oct-18 05:17 AM] CHMEX#0686
Ot would be intressting to see of an order like that ever filled just like that on a cex. I imagine this trades would go OTC

[16-Oct-18 05:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c the 1st address in top 100 might be binance

[16-Oct-18 05:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes Pi73 might be the cold store

[16-Oct-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, in that case, we will see this go down if the whale is fed?

[16-Oct-18 05:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well it would confirm it 😛

[16-Oct-18 05:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Unless whale plans to pump KMD after with his remaining 20k BTC then sell the 2M KMD

[16-Oct-18 05:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
:abusedsmily:

[16-Oct-18 05:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Then we wont know at all lol

[16-Oct-18 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
is it worth pumping a coin when you only have 2% of it?

[16-Oct-18 05:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
CHMEX was helpful enough to take a snapshot of the top 100, so if the whale gets filled we should be able to tell where it has gone, if they cashout that is.

[16-Oct-18 05:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
One can only dream James 😛

[16-Oct-18 05:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
If you play with 2% on a cex I can imagine you have another 10% in the last 20000 addresses on the richlist.

[16-Oct-18 05:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
And you wave the 5% reward

[16-Oct-18 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC has rewards?

[16-Oct-18 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
peoples need to feed the whale, then we can see where it ends up

[16-Oct-18 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the whale just wants to buy PIRATE and needs the KMD first?

{Reactions}
🤔 (3) treasure 

[16-Oct-18 05:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Can someone just deposit 2M KMD and feed the whale please?

[16-Oct-18 05:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I want to see how this turns out 😛

[16-Oct-18 05:35 AM] jspook16#3059
What happens if kmd ends up supported by Fidelity..

[16-Oct-18 05:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If we all sold 100 KMD each we just need 2000 people

[16-Oct-18 05:35 AM] CHMEX#0686
There are 15k PIRATE in OTC for BTC😃

[16-Oct-18 05:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
haha

[16-Oct-18 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
@hyperDEX i think you are off by 10x

[16-Oct-18 05:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Missed a 0 on the 100 😄

[16-Oct-18 05:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586

Such a stablecoin

[16-Oct-18 06:22 AM] Mark81#4505
Komodo is definatelly reacting most positively to rising Bitcoin price.

[16-Oct-18 06:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The 350BTC guy knows something we dont

[16-Oct-18 06:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or he has seen the same light as we have

[16-Oct-18 06:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
:1M: :1M:

[16-Oct-18 07:13 AM] dxer666#8963
24 hours with 350 btc buy order with huge pump is intersting..

[16-Oct-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@hyperDEX he/she knows that the ones selling are not hodlers. 😅

[16-Oct-18 08:12 AM] Mark81#4505
That wall is at 18000sat now...

[16-Oct-18 08:35 AM] dxer666#8963
327 btc 19000 now

[16-Oct-18 08:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Think he ate up the 18-19k asks and sitting on 19k now

[16-Oct-18 08:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like this whale wants in!

[16-Oct-18 08:41 AM] Mark81#4505
Why! Why! Do not moon yet!

[16-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Mark81#4505
I think he knows that he will not get filled! Or he/she is stupid. This game aint plsyed like that. But to the moon game is!

[16-Oct-18 08:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well we know his motives now, it is to get the KMD before moon time 😛

[16-Oct-18 08:51 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Upbit/trex trailing as usual

[16-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Binance is where the whales go

[16-Oct-18 08:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They dont have bids for 350 at 19k hehe

[16-Oct-18 08:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The whale might be lurking here too, if he is please buy up to 20k or 30k, i like round numbers,

[16-Oct-18 08:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@siu - Chainmakers what do we have to reach to have TA confirmed we are in a up trend?

[16-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Close daily above resistance

[16-Oct-18 09:05 AM] snowdamn#2414
"The whale might be lurking here too" - be generous with your Bids and pile up quick because as you can see KMD whales' wallets are in hibernation, probably until $50-100 😉

[16-Oct-18 09:09 AM] Mark81#4505
If kmd reach $50 i promise to retire!

[16-Oct-18 09:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I will take $10 for now and promise to buy some stale bread to feed the ducks at the park

[16-Oct-18 09:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Alright i will do one better, fresh bread for the ducks and the bums around the park

[16-Oct-18 09:29 AM] Mark81#4505
If we continue this whale will back off from kmd 😂
