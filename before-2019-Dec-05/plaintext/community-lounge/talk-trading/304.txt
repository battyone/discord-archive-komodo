we are at Last year in Reverse Clock Capital Crypto Value üìä

[25-Nov-18 01:10 AM] jspook16#3059
is this the end?

[25-Nov-18 01:12 AM] Hermes#6934
My 2 cents into this...If you are seeing Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Google falling...(FANGS) You are correct institutional investors are dumping stocks in the stock market. Which was the new innovation of this year ...a bigger Iphone? Bitcoin is still bigger than Paypal...it's time to shine....for me the biggest road blocks that Facebook and all of these companies...are going to face is privacy and people getting back their privacy from their databases. There is opportunity in the tech market for Blockchain...but yeah...Which was the biggest innovation of tech this year ?...the next bull market...is going to be for me honestly based on healthcare stocks....and companies doing gene experiments and so on.

[25-Nov-18 01:13 AM] ryman112#0068
Not good MAV this is not good

[25-Nov-18 01:14 AM] Hermes#6934
I also believe that institutional investors already bought bitcoin...and other alts...and now they are just seeing the technology market overpriced...because of the FANGS crashing in the stock market.

[25-Nov-18 01:16 AM] Hermes#6934
I remember when Google and Facebook were the big wow factor...movies and stuff...now each year you only get a bigger Iphone...things have come to a halt in the consumer technology sector.

[25-Nov-18 01:17 AM] Hermes#6934
the new consumer technology sector could be robotics and healthcare....cyborgs ü§ñ

[25-Nov-18 01:18 AM] Hermes#6934
that would be the next bull market.

[25-Nov-18 01:25 AM] PHBA2061#2530
healthcare is definitely a growing sector with a lot of startups

[25-Nov-18 01:30 AM] Torankoku#4818
healthcare stocks and emerging markets -- that is, if global debt does not get to us first

[25-Nov-18 01:34 AM] Hermes#6934
there is current update for the daemon...

[25-Nov-18 01:35 AM] jspook16#3059
sweet .... too bad the market is yucky right now....maybe kmd will rise from these ashes as the new head honcho

[25-Nov-18 01:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
Fang stocks got way out hand. Sad think is there‚Äôs millions of 401k‚Äôs that have been and are going to get decimated because of it.

[25-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I called 3800 bottom awhile ago

[25-Nov-18 01:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You know it's bad in crypto when the convo turns to stocks

[25-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yet here we are

[25-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Torankoku#4818
markets like this should be your opportunity

[25-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Torankoku#4818
unless you think crypto is going away

[25-Nov-18 01:41 AM] Hermes#6934
now is an opportunity to buy that's true...

[25-Nov-18 01:41 AM] Hermes#6934
but I won't say it  because it would be taken as investment advice :trollface:

[25-Nov-18 01:42 AM] Hermes#6934
will just wait a little bit more to see where it goes

[25-Nov-18 01:52 AM] OliverDay#5571
Why is KMD wallet down on Binance?

[25-Nov-18 01:52 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Maybe ask the folks at binance?

[25-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Torankoku#4818
i rather not knife catch

[25-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Torankoku#4818
classic strategy - buy on the way down,  hold on the way up

[25-Nov-18 02:27 AM] Crizia#1951
next real supp is 2980$

[25-Nov-18 03:00 AM] tolken#2655
Realz support, a lot better than the pretend shit.

[25-Nov-18 03:22 AM] Sdunbar#5064
strongest support is at zero

[25-Nov-18 03:22 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Seems possible bitcoin could reach negative dollars though

risk takers at the end will make the blockchain market a necessity for many reasons.

[25-Nov-18 04:18 AM] Jax#4739
Just checked prices for the first time in 2 days.

[25-Nov-18 04:18 AM] Jax#4739

[25-Nov-18 06:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its quite depressing though

[25-Nov-18 06:21 AM] Hermes#6934
‚ÄúThis is about the fifth or sixth 75 percent-plus drawdown that we‚Äôve seen in the 10-year history of Bitcoin.

And so if you have that [long-term] lens, I don‚Äôt believe institutional investors really ultimately care where the price of Bitcoin ends in 2018, simply because they‚Äôre looking at things three to five years out.‚Äù

[25-Nov-18 06:23 AM] Hermes#6934
2020 seems to be the year.

[25-Nov-18 06:28 AM] AndrewK#3947
Will sending KMD to my KMD address on Binance still work even though it says wallet is in maintenance?

[25-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Hermes#6934
Not sure about it ...they need to do a mandatory update to their wallet.

[25-Nov-18 06:31 AM] Hermes#6934
They should be able to resume after the update...in either case if we get any confirmation from them we will let you know.

[25-Nov-18 06:37 AM] ryman112#0068
@Hollowman9000  you sob lol

Komodo back to under ico price?

[25-Nov-18 07:39 AM] Seko#7408
The market hurts.  With every "crash" I thought it was over now.  And every time it got worse.

[25-Nov-18 08:18 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
well it seems I bought some  KMD just too eraly at 4.2k$ per BTC... seems I forgot I should have bought on the bottom :pirate:

[25-Nov-18 08:40 AM] snowdamn#2414
KMD desperately needs a significant increase in 24h Volume
price will follow (even if the volume increase initially brings a price drop)

[25-Nov-18 08:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I am surprised kmd holds the btc value quite well tbh

[25-Nov-18 08:43 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, but i wouldn't make much of it with current Volume

[25-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Holding the value would mean no decrease in rank

[25-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or not so much. Hard times. Could be worse

[25-Nov-18 08:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
With the prices we re at the volume is low just because people are waiting for even lower price to reenter the game

[25-Nov-18 08:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
holding the BTC rate means KMD whales are not itching to exit
but low 24h Volume means high risk in case a couple of them did
to me, a higher rank in 24h Volume is more important than rank in price (at this stage)
of course, a bull whale could make the opposite happen, but we're in a bear market üòÖ

[25-Nov-18 09:29 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
same risk for all alts

[25-Nov-18 09:29 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
yo ucan always increase volume if you really wish to :trollface:

[25-Nov-18 09:30 AM] snowdamn#2414
i urge you to rank based on 24h Volume and look at the projects above Komodo
i'm sure you'll get the picture...

[25-Nov-18 09:32 AM] snowdamn#2414
if it weren't for the Binance listing, much ugly

[25-Nov-18 09:33 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Rebranding is in progress, I'm sure when it's over marketing team will take care of more exposure (like paid articles,  cmc adds, new exchanges) and this will give volumes

[25-Nov-18 09:34 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, looking forward to rebranding!
sounds exciting

[25-Nov-18 09:34 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
KMD seems to be best product on the market. Best product with little marketing push will give easy volumes and top 20 easy imho.

[25-Nov-18 09:35 AM] snowdamn#2414
hopefully rebranding will boost exposure and get a few more CEX listings
unfortunately, the Volume thing i brought up is heavily influenced by CEXs

[25-Nov-18 09:35 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
MEdium hard may be top 10, real resistance to get to top 5. But since you really get the product it's a matter of adds. **If adds do the miracles for shitty projects, imagine what they can do for a good project.**
