If I m not mistaken zack was with augur the one who enlightend? you about the DTO

[31-Oct-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
well he enlightened me why aggregated oracles are not reliable. i came up with the DTO as a response

[31-Oct-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
to my knowledge DTO is the simplest trustless oracle that is fully decentralized.

[31-Oct-19 05:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
I like to that in this eco system how different people give each other ideas and code envoles.
Apparently he went through bad times at aeternity

[31-Oct-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
he wants the best tech and the biz types probably didnt like what he was saying

[31-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Privatoshi#9487
He does really good work, on the tech side of thing.  It sounds like he has been on the wrong end of the business side, a few times. That's unfortunate.

[31-Oct-19 06:39 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Amoveo, I haven't looked into. I've heard good things about it.

komodo in recent months behaved monotonously relative to bitcoin and fell both with the growth of bitcoin and with the fall of bitcoin, therefore there is a big mystery where the price will be when bitcoin takes at least $ 16000
