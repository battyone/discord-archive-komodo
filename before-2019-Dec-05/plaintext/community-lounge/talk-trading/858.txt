kmd has angered the crypto gods, we must make an offering

[26-Jun-19 03:51 PM] jspook16#3059
Burn kmd?

[26-Jun-19 03:52 PM] Mark81#4505
Nebl/btc have even worse performance.

[26-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
guys everything is getting wrecked. There is nothing special about KMD

[26-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Markus#5464
u would think that kmd have atleast abit better buy support then this considering how the ecosystem look like and what is cooking

[26-Jun-19 03:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
Sorry let me reprhase, there is nothing negatively special about KMD that is making it do worse than other alts

[26-Jun-19 03:55 PM] Markus#5464
sure

[26-Jun-19 03:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
Bitty is just running the show. Once KMD starts to pump again everyone will be a happy KMD supporter again lol

One good thing is last time bitcoin dominance went from 63% to 57% then kmd went from 14k to 22k

[26-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Markus#5464
so if btc dominance starts to retrace soon maybe we get that 100% gain to 20k ðŸ˜„

I bet Genie is seething with rage right now.

[26-Jun-19 04:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
At the end of the day genie likes money just like the next guy

[26-Jun-19 04:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Probably had his wife put him in a straight jacket with orders to not release him until BTC retraces

[26-Jun-19 04:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am sure he does. But he hates btc with a vengeance

[26-Jun-19 04:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
true

[26-Jun-19 04:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
And he claims to hold no btc... because itâ€™s so shitty.

[26-Jun-19 04:35 PM] Markus#5464

[26-Jun-19 04:38 PM] Tek#5253
16k is the target

[26-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Tek#5253
and many analist think $50k to $100k by EOY

[26-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Markus#5464
if btc will hit 50k to 100k this year

[26-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Markus#5464

[26-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Jun-19 04:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
But JL seems so much more chill than Craig Wright. How can they be the same person?

[26-Jun-19 04:45 PM] Tek#5253
