Do you understand the problem they introduced with maxreorgdepth and uploading new checkpoints every 10 blocks?

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
again, imagine if KMD had a single notary node deciding what the "real" chain is

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
that is how ABC is operating right now

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
There isn't a single node doing the checkpoints though

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its arbitrary

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
it's not

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
4K petabyte ? you meant petahash ?

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
anyone running a client with the ability to checkpoint

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
yea phba

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
and mining to it can allocate the block

[24-Nov-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
they are uploading new checkpoints to the releases automatically every 10 blocks

[24-Nov-18 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
meaning longest chain rule doesn't matter *at all* anymore

[24-Nov-18 09:58 PM] bishop#9773
SV cannot become ABC with checkpointing. Two separate chains now

[24-Nov-18 09:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it does but it helps massive reorgs from occuring

[24-Nov-18 09:58 PM] bishop#9773
no risk of a hidden blockchain being shadowmined

[24-Nov-18 09:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
basically the genesis block attack vector is gone

[24-Nov-18 09:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Even though it honestly was never thought of as a problem

[24-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
I'll just keep saying this... üòÖ imagine if KMD had a single notary node

[24-Nov-18 09:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
There isn't though that point isn't valid because you can be in consensus on bitrrcoin unlimited client

[24-Nov-18 10:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
and run both chains

[24-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
SV is the technically superior chain out of BTC ABC and SV as of right now

[24-Nov-18 10:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161

[24-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
unfortunately

[24-Nov-18 10:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
doesnt work that way

[24-Nov-18 10:01 PM] BlackJesus#6161
BCH's difificulty skyrocketed so of course the lower hashpower chain is going to outrun it eventually

[24-Nov-18 10:01 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the same can be said about BTC legacy and BCH

[24-Nov-18 10:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
over extended period of time lower difficulty chains will mine more blocks than higher difficulty chains just because "luck" is more abundant with less people competing for it.

[24-Nov-18 10:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Btw ver is probably going to only mine bch now with that move. I don't think he'll mine BTC again he already said he can run 10 years unprofitable ://..

[24-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
the only chain with any technical merit left is SV

[24-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
pains me to say that

[24-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Markus#5464
Eth almost below 100$

[24-Nov-18 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
Best case scenario here is for everything to detach from BTC

[24-Nov-18 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
could happen as more and more people realize that each chain is just controlled by some entity and not as decentralized as they think

[24-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
BTC(blockstream), ABC(bitcoin.com), SV(nchain)

[24-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder what will happen when we reach the 3500 range

[24-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[24-Nov-18 10:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
people are calling $3000 already

[24-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Reel Em In#1495
.57$ getting closer and closer to breaking .5$

[24-Nov-18 10:16 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if btc drops, it drags everything down aswell ...

[24-Nov-18 10:20 PM] crumb#2550
one thing that i really hope (but might not happen, at least yet) is decoupling from BTC. for that to happen there needs to be alternative(s). 
DEX-s where direct pairs between different tokens are possible? but DEX-s are not mature enough, at least GUI and UX wise. and do we like it or not, most of the people cannot appreciate functioning CLI tech ü§ì

[24-Nov-18 10:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
you can give ABC the BCH symbol

[24-Nov-18 10:20 PM] modereck#4269
good night I dont wana see this crap

Embrace the bear. He is cuddly. When he gets tired, soon, there will be a bounce

If all your income is in crypto based on fiat rates, this is like christmas :trollface:

exactly. safespace probably has some nice and cuddly panda bears

[24-Nov-18 10:24 PM] Cassius#9158
Rsi is almost oversold on the weekly. That takes a lot. Guess the last time it happened...

`If all your income is in crypto based on fiat rates, this is like christmas`
Yes, the part of it where you give, not the part where you receive üòù

[24-Nov-18 10:26 PM] Alright#0419
$1 of $3000 BTC or $1 of $6000 BTC is still $1

[24-Nov-18 10:29 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
until you need to *use* your income (you know that whole "currency" thing) and then that $1 you earned in BTC costs you $2 worth of what you earned to buy $1 worth of widgetY....

[24-Nov-18 10:35 PM] Reel Em In#1495
wow, lost another 5% in less than 10 min,  .54$ now

[24-Nov-18 10:58 PM] Reel Em In#1495
doesnt something like "subsidies " kick in for miners around this price? thought I heard that before?

[24-Nov-18 10:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
shits gonna hit the fan.

[24-Nov-18 11:02 PM] Reel Em In#1495
at what kmd price does it become unprofitable for notaries?

[24-Nov-18 11:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I think it‚Äôs already at this stage

[24-Nov-18 11:09 PM] Alright#0419
@Reel Em In notary should be mining ~50 KMD a day if that gives you some perspective

[24-Nov-18 11:10 PM] Alright#0419
few hundred dollars a month for the server(can range *a lot* based on different things)

[24-Nov-18 11:10 PM] Reel Em In#1495
yeah I think were are right about there as well, thats why I am asking?

[24-Nov-18 11:11 PM] Reel Em In#1495
@Alright  thank you for the info

[24-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380
So it‚Äôs still profitable even with this low price in usd ?

[24-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380
never seen Komodo so low since I joined in 2017.

[24-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Early 2017..

[24-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Usd price I mean

[24-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Jetter73#2234
BTC too.

new ATL for kmd on binnance against btc, has been as low as around 6k stats on trex if I remember correct

[24-Nov-18 11:13 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
bittrex and binance KMD wallets are both down for maintenance as well. Kinda frustrating

[24-Nov-18 11:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
that could be the catalyst for the drop

[24-Nov-18 11:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
if you cant get your kmd out, you just sell it for something you can get out

[24-Nov-18 11:14 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Mmh, bit annoying.

[24-Nov-18 11:15 PM] Reel Em In#1495
looks like kmd withdrawl is working in binance for me? anyone else ?

[24-Nov-18 11:19 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah fair enough, I don't use binance much

[24-Nov-18 11:22 PM] PTYX#6840
I believe there is an update to the daemon happening

[24-Nov-18 11:22 PM] Vertigo#0439
OMG I'm broker than an hour ago

[24-Nov-18 11:23 PM] Vertigo#0439
And that was already broke

[24-Nov-18 11:23 PM] PTYX#6840
That's likely the reason why exchanges would halt withdrawals

[24-Nov-18 11:27 PM] Vertigo#0439
I don't want to see whalebro's portfolio drop

[24-Nov-18 11:27 PM] Vertigo#0439
Maybe he sold firts

[24-Nov-18 11:28 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
he didn't

[24-Nov-18 11:28 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
you'd see it in the volume

[24-Nov-18 11:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
poor whalebro, man.

[24-Nov-18 11:30 PM] Vertigo#0439
He is down 50% at least

[24-Nov-18 11:30 PM] Vertigo#0439
Has balls of steel

[24-Nov-18 11:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
with great gains come great losses I guess

[24-Nov-18 11:31 PM] Vertigo#0439
Are we lower than the beginning of the bullrun?

[24-Nov-18 11:31 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I think we are touching 3.5 k for btc it seems it‚Äôs heading that way

[24-Nov-18 11:32 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It bounced back a little bit but idk

[24-Nov-18 11:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think the whole market is about to correct. stock market, real estate bubble, in for a good show now  üçø
