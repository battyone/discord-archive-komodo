Lack of pressure.  Instruments need to be and are in fact being developed to work on this in this.  It comes down to this psychology: 1 group holds because it knows it's more valuable than the 50+ shitcoins above it by MC. The other has the benefit of playing a game of attrition .  Which side will fold first.

[25-Dec-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My theory has always been the 5% reward ... doube edged swoard ... we love it... but it also means most of the coins created had no mining cost.

[25-Dec-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Whales can sell their rewards forever ...

[25-Dec-18 01:08 AM] PHBA2061#2530
$200 retrace on btc btw

[25-Dec-18 01:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
And that's fine right now especially if it goes to people who have the same idea in mind.   Even more so if they use the Komodo rewards to grow the community or tech

Never said it was a bad thing. ... its just something I thaught of as to why the price is always being pushed down.

[25-Dec-18 01:11 AM] Markus#5464
seems to hold 3800 nicely

[25-Dec-18 01:13 AM] Markus#5464
bouncing back and forth between 3800 and 34 ema what look to be resistance atm

[25-Dec-18 01:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
another reason I could think of is kmd is not very well known in Asia (asian countries account for a lot of trading volume in crypto)

[25-Dec-18 01:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Around 8% a year supply growth.  I am going to advocate a rewards feedback loop, starting with mining pools but extending into other areas as well.  In an example with mining pools , have a 2% fee half of which goes to funding a reward pool that  is used to generate Komodo coins to give as a bonus to block finders

[25-Dec-18 01:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We need to get out from behind the computers and evangelize more as well

[25-Dec-18 01:17 AM] Likewise#6767
since BTC hasnt seen its lows yet I suppose the other coins will follow suit and dip lower

[25-Dec-18 01:19 AM] ryman112#0068
Merry Christmas everyone!

[25-Dec-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats true ... its not like I go telling anyone to buy irl ..

Or will we get a ne wyear present?

putting on a Xmas trade in Bitmex, short BTC at current levels SL4240. These are not my hodl coins!

[25-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Likewise#6767
lets change that SL to 4040

[25-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Lieutenant#1428
@Likewise  who will buy what falls without recovery?  We need stable growth up and large volumes.  by example stratis and waves

[25-Dec-18 01:53 AM] Likewise#6767
Indeed, so need to reach a wider group.

[25-Dec-18 01:54 AM] Likewise#6767
And it needs to be understandable for non tech geeks, not all investors are tech minded.

[25-Dec-18 01:54 AM] Lieutenant#1428
no stable growth up, no public attention

[25-Dec-18 01:55 AM] Likewise#6767
As a long term investor/trader one thing my fellow investors are afraid of is stuff they dont know.

[25-Dec-18 01:56 AM] Lieutenant#1428

Most fellow traders in my age group 45-50 are wary of the unknown

[25-Dec-18 01:57 AM] Likewise#6767
Am trying to convince them of putting some of their profits in the new world

[25-Dec-18 01:59 AM] Likewise#6767
shows how wary people are of the unknown. Some of these guys have made good money in tradional markets yet still wary of even throwing a 10k$ to crypto. I'm the odd one out in that group 😃

[25-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Likewise#6767
yes in KMD' case the PA is not really attractive. Been following it for a year. Volume, public attention  is what we need yep

[25-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Likewise#6767
well at least my short BTC is in the green 😉

[25-Dec-18 02:07 AM] Likewise#6767
SL at entry about to get hit 3 2 1.....off to beach barbie for Xmas later. No short term trades.

[25-Dec-18 02:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Komodo has never focused on price,  usage of the tech is coming which will drive that naturally we see it first with delayed proof of work, we see it with the dICOs that have been done and other things that are being built like KSB.   Once there hits a critical mass of deep hodlers( won't sell no matter what because either they rely upon generating Komodo for their business or are diehards or just like the passive rewards )   It will be off to the races.

[25-Dec-18 02:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Even just the chains that are being secured right now require 1/8000 of the supply a year

[25-Dec-18 02:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Was taking number of chains being dpowed at 40 and 365 kmd cost , so not including other costs associated with DPoW

[25-Dec-18 02:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The number of chains alone will grow rapidly over the next few years, I foresee at least a doubling every year.

[25-Dec-18 02:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
how many things can you oracle-Ize ?  How many CC tech chains  branching off of each chain?     Once demand exceeds generation of 8% it should be a constant trend upwards.

[25-Dec-18 02:57 AM] designer#4893
Now, the craze over Bitcoin and crypto has died down and prices have gone down. 
It is almost impossible to see any reason to refute the claim that the tulip bubble is blowing out. 
But this should be seen as a time when mainstream society and the government are allowed to prepare intellectually.

[25-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
@designer you mind changing your name?

[25-Dec-18 03:06 AM] Alright#0419
Not saying you have to, but it's confused even me

[25-Dec-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r even if 100% of the rewards are sold by everyone (quite unlikely) it is a sell pressure of 14000 KMD per day

[25-Dec-18 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it is small amount of daily volume

[25-Dec-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Volume takes into account bots who use the same coins over and over again. I bet if I had 14,000 kmd a day and sold it at the right times the price would go down quite a lot over time.

[25-Dec-18 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but the realistic amount is much less than 14000 per day

[25-Dec-18 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
that assume 100% of people sell 100%

[25-Dec-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was just a speculation .. Normally coins have some cost to create where as rewards do not.

[25-Dec-18 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
for PoW it is true, for PoS it is normal

[25-Dec-18 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
granted 5% is at the higher end of PoS returns

[25-Dec-18 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and some people consider capital utilization as an opportunity cost.

[25-Dec-18 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
I think when KMD price is $10, that is $140,000 per day of sell pressure, so it takes millions per day of volume to absorb it. At $1 prices, the sell pressure is not much of an effect and during the high volume moves, 14000 coins are eaten in minutes

Low volume btc dump on a day most traders are not looking at charts

[25-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Who would have thought 🤔

[25-Dec-18 11:16 AM] ver_User#6608
Has anyone speculated how much of the KMD market is traded by bots?

[25-Dec-18 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the majority of trades ("fake" and legit alike) are bots
it's 2018 and the base code for things like trades has existed for far longer than crypto itself

[25-Dec-18 11:46 AM] Lumbi#8378
I see KMD's potential gold mine in barterDEX.. just institute KMD as the payment method and maybe a staking lock with rewards like CB. Make it easy to sign up with low fees and minimal gatekeeping ...

[25-Dec-18 11:49 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
1% trading fee on all trades with any coins, free with kmd pairing 😛

it jumps back up very fast

[25-Dec-18 12:42 PM] ver_User#6608
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 for sure, I know that most trades are bots these days across most asset classes, however KMDBTC in particular seems to be such absolute chop (I don't trade many smaller cap alts, so I'm sure this applies across many) that many decisions seem to be by bots (strange decisions), with occasional strong intervention from humans that carve out levels and general direction. Other pairs like btcusd, and even ethbtc I imagine, have a higher proportion or ratio of ongoing human traders day to day. Keen to know if anyone had looked into this at all

[25-Dec-18 12:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
Maybe if u tracked the  order placement timing via the exchange's api , you could  see all the orders that are being placed at precisely repeated intervals. Separate those from the orders placed at random intervals and you may have a better idea of bot vs. human trade activity.

[25-Dec-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What if I told you that 99% of the reason I became active in Komodo was because there once was a slack channel mislabeled #tradebots....

[25-Dec-18 01:12 PM] Tek#5253
what if I told you that buying 10k kmd would move the price to 18.5k

[25-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Lumbi#8378
I was thinking today about trade bots... easy to program with a straight forward API

[25-Dec-18 01:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
I wonder what fail-safes the newer bots have to defuse a bot war...

[25-Dec-18 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most have none because most don't want to do such a thing

Anyone else super excited for oCryptoUnions launch on komodo? 😄

[25-Dec-18 04:04 PM] yorklab#7270
oCryptoUnions  sounds very interesting. I do hope they do well with their IPO/STO. Getting money for a startup has been an issue for many new projects lately.

was thinking about selling some kmd for eth yesterday, glad I didn't lol

[25-Dec-18 05:08 PM] yorklab#7270
I normally don't get to sit home and watch this, but when I see a whale sitting there like that, it tells me that this person/group either needs kmd because of a large project that will be using dPOW or investors that are expecting some big things in the near future; yet people have no hesitation to sell. I understand that for some, kmd is their income and have to sell, but for others I don't get it, maybe this just a kmd thing, or perhaps just normal trading.

[25-Dec-18 05:14 PM] yorklab#7270
The good thing is the those that wanted to sell can now do so and that could leave fewer sellers.
