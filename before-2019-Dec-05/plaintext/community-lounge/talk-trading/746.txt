I've once heard a futures trader say "short the news, cover the body count"

[05-Jun-19 04:41 PM] klein#5233
James statement was the equivalent of the  body count moment

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] klein#5233
"nodejs vulnerability, 1M coins lost etc"

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well that will teach ppls for using Java script ay

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
James codes.in c.... So u know what u getting

[05-Jun-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really..
 C doesn't needed a package manager

[05-Jun-19 04:43 PM] jorian#4555
we knew this beforehand

[05-Jun-19 04:43 PM] jorian#4555
still we continued the use

[05-Jun-19 04:43 PM] jorian#4555
and it's even worse, because guess who is very strong on security and failed to properly audit Agama?

[05-Jun-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright? ü§£

[05-Jun-19 04:46 PM] jorian#4555
but hey, wasn't it open source? or was the faulty dependency closed source?

[05-Jun-19 04:47 PM] jorian#4555
as we don't know which dependency it was, your statement doesn't make sense, because Agama has never been closed source

[05-Jun-19 04:47 PM] jorian#4555
we'd have to wait for the CVE to appear

some of the dependencies in npm would take weeks to comb through

[05-Jun-19 04:49 PM] jorian#4555
and you can never trust a package manager

[05-Jun-19 04:49 PM] jorian#4555
yes, the fiat of package manager

[05-Jun-19 04:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
theres is no free lunch

[05-Jun-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Um... Build.sh builds all the deps...

[05-Jun-19 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
From.source.

[05-Jun-19 04:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
no matter what it could have been much worse

[05-Jun-19 04:52 PM] jorian#4555

DP isn't letting me cancel my KMD order, is it the same for other major exchanges?
I wanted to see if I could transfer KMD and try to buy more at 16K sats

[05-Jun-19 04:55 PM] actionslacks#4072
pretty sure most are on lockdown at the moment

[05-Jun-19 04:55 PM] VainSlay#7979
rip

[05-Jun-19 04:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
This is very bad. From a community that is constantly boasting about tech and security... this is very bad.

[05-Jun-19 04:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
And it highlights a weakness of KMD... they don‚Äôt really finish things. They move on to the next thing while limping along with super-crappy wallets.

[05-Jun-19 05:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
well a vulnerability will be repaired. I guess that can be the silver lining. And having the dev chops to hack the majority of funds to safety before the real hacker(s) got them is a stroke of technical heroism.

[05-Jun-19 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
That is one way to look at it.

[05-Jun-19 05:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
But an asset that can‚Äôt be safely hodl‚Äôd or transferred is an asset whose future value is zero

[05-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
OceanQT is safu

[05-Jun-19 05:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
They need a wallet that isn‚Äôt a crap-bucket immediately

[05-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And fast

[05-Jun-19 05:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ocean is a shit-box too.

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Komodod itself is safu guy's

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ocean is simple, worked fast for me

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
If KMD wants adoption, it needs a good wallet. Right now it has crappy wallets that people make excuses for.

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If kmd wants adoption it needs to redesign itself front he ground up for that

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] Tek#5253
shoulda listened to that anon on biz when he said agama was shit

[05-Jun-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
hah you assume I married dash

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Tek#5253
still a safer hold than kmd it seems üòâ

This whole event should be highly embarrassing for a community who constantly boasts about tech and security. I hope some egos got checked by this.

The Ocean wallet is the old school QT wallets. It's about as basic as you can get.

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I like basic

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] actionslacks#4072
My paranoia gets validated and bolstered more everyday.

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Outside of CLI of course.

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not mine, I just will keep.doing what I'm doing, I thought this was hilarious tbh

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ocean is awful. It is as intuitive and user friendly as shit-covered punji sticks in a fall-trap

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Tek#5253
quick reminder that dash wallet works right now and works fine, all the time. 
I had to update my kmd wallet last week cause the servers weren't responding. 
Then suddenly the entire wallet was unsafe

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Tek#5253
> muh dash is such a shite cone

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
And yet Ocean was the standard for nearly all crypto coins for years.

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It was nicely retro

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
thx for the constructive critique @meatspoon

Moved coins

[05-Jun-19 05:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Done

[05-Jun-19 05:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
(Exporting priv key via console that is)

[05-Jun-19 05:09 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I actually preferred the QT version on most coins. Faster and uses less resources.

[05-Jun-19 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All wallets are bloat use SSL from bash to sign your transactions :troll:

[05-Jun-19 05:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
the whole reason for the vulnerability is people bitching about waiting for blockchains to sync

[05-Jun-19 05:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
@actionslacks I gave a bunch of constructive criticism months ago in the Agama channel and via DM to devs... it was not heeded.

[05-Jun-19 05:12 PM] Tek#5253

`the whole reason for the vulnerability is people bitching about waiting for blockchains to sync` this

[05-Jun-19 05:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
@meatspoon I'm not very happy either. this is a total pain in ass for me. taking frustration out on people isn't gonna help

[05-Jun-19 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I spent hundreds of hours working to get komodod to sync faster, and nobody cares

[05-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Tek#5253
yeah uh im not a techlet but lite wallets is what drive adoption

[05-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Tek#5253

Kmd can sync in 5h block.zero to to full on a 50mbit connection

[05-Jun-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It used to take 24h

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
if I hve to wait more than a minute its useless ( speaking as a user )

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
so lite wallets are needed

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lite wallets are not neede d guys...

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
