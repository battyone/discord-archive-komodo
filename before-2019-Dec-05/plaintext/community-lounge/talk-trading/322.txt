`i cannot print money you stuopid fucking retard`
Actually, you can; you just can't legally print USD at will
The problem here is you don't understand the basic meanings of the words "currency" and "money"

`i thought you could actually print money that merchants accepted`
You can, if you and the merchant agree that it has value
because that's how money works

@jl777c do you think bitcoin has a chance at being a settlement layer or worldwide currency ?
