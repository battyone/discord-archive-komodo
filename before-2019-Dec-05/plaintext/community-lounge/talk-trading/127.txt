that's a huge wall

[03-Sep-18 04:48 PM] yorklab#7270
Looks like that buy wall was real. Ran out of patience and bought a load and is still there waiting for more.

[03-Sep-18 04:49 PM] snowdamn#2414

[03-Sep-18 04:54 PM] jspook16#3059
you think its the same person that was trying get $1 mil worth on here a while back?

[03-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
153k sell wall at 21000, if the buy whale is serious, this is the best time to get a bunch and swallow the wall üòÑ

I love komodo

[03-Sep-18 05:04 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
ETH marketcap used to be worth 50% of BTC , now it's barely reaching 24%

He‚Äôll be sprinkling in dumpage in between his two walls

[03-Sep-18 05:10 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It seems he/she is trying to create a pump at least all the way to the wall

[03-Sep-18 05:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Atmosphere isn‚Äôt there yet

[03-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

No one will be charging out into the open just yet

[03-Sep-18 05:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Everyone who jumped the gun in recent memory got cut down by whale fire

[03-Sep-18 05:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hopefully they‚Äôre in KMD for the long haul, because attempting a pump now is a fool‚Äôs errand

[03-Sep-18 05:13 PM] yorklab#7270
That's OK, it creates interest.

[03-Sep-18 05:13 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not many new dumb monies get in yet, probably by christmas when everybody gets their huge bonuses

[03-Sep-18 05:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs nice to see some action, don‚Äôt get me wrong @yorklab

[03-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

end of the cycle, that's alright üòÑ

[03-Sep-18 05:18 PM] yorklab#7270
I think anytime there is a little pump like this there is always someone who will think "so what is this Komodo thing?"

[03-Sep-18 05:18 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
although i would prefer smart money who would hodl for at least 14 years get in KMD üòÑ

[03-Sep-18 05:20 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
there's no significant pump on any coins lately, so if KMD be the first pump to signal the super bull. That will be a great thing.

[03-Sep-18 05:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nano, iota, eos and now etc are pumping

[03-Sep-18 05:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So.kmd wouldnt be the first pump

[03-Sep-18 05:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also dash

[03-Sep-18 05:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not even btc rise is significant yet

[03-Sep-18 05:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Mr Whale is tired of your unwillingness to sell into his buywall at 18k satoshi and moved it up to 20k and still hungry for more... Big things happening for the following months and someone did the math. üöÄüöÄüöÄ @KomodoPlatform $KMD

[03-Sep-18 05:35 PM] pinkolin#9557
Do you know where is ETA for interest change?

[03-Sep-18 05:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[03-Sep-18 05:37 PM] pinkolin#9557
And you need now claim every month?

[03-Sep-18 05:37 PM] pinkolin#9557

everyone is front running the whale lol

[03-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Tek#5253
@Hollowman9000 yeah there's a slik road related btc wallet with 110k bitcoin in it that has recently started to show activity, it hadn't been touched since, 2014 or so.

[03-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Tek#5253
he's splitting up the BTC and sending amounts to Binance and Bitfinex

[03-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Tek#5253
obviously to buy XMR and other Privacy focussed coins

[03-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Tek#5253
I'm guessing XMR and KMD are his picks

[03-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But that money is being tracked by the feds?

[03-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
