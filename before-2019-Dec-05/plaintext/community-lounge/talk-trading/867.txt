@Markus here is your correction! now the fiat peg bots turn off

[27-Jun-19 09:14 AM] jansako#3330
By July 15th the alts should be on the up and up, did you have a Oracle pick that date for you? 😃

[27-Jun-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
bargain hunting should begin after the BTC stabilizes

[27-Jun-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
we are not timing anything to the trading markets. notice we worked all through the bear market, we will work all through the bull market and the next bear market, ...

[27-Jun-19 09:15 AM] jansako#3330
that wasn't the question... still any PR campaing effects can get multiplied if run at the right time

[27-Jun-19 09:16 AM] jansako#3330
I understand it was most likely a coincidence, but it does stink of a JL-magic

[27-Jun-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the july 15th date was set well before the recent bull stampede

[27-Jun-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
just needs to retest 10k

[27-Jun-19 09:22 AM] Keppie#5156
Yup, my take on it aswell

[27-Jun-19 09:23 AM] Keppie#5156
Buy support at 10k is quite high i'd imagine

[27-Jun-19 09:24 AM] jansako#3330
Wouldn't mind KMD retesting 11k  in the process as well... not asking for 13 😃

[27-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Markus#5464
kmd can easily jump quite high doesnt nedd alot of pressure

not enough food here for any big whales, but only for dolphins

[27-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Markus#5464
well any big whale could easily push price to lets say 50k and place a large order there it will eventually get filled

[27-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Lumbi#8378
just imagine the value jump an  'unknown alt' could do, if it were accepted as a valid form of payment for commodities 🤔

I cannot work as a pornstar anymore, I got high on cheap polish speed few days ago, wake up horny, jerked off 14 times in a row, peeled off all my foreskin, kidney almost failed, I have to take a break  @Keppie

[27-Jun-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`high on cheap polish speed`
you're supposed to cut it up, not wax it

[27-Jun-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`peeled off all my foreskin`
is that what you polished it with?

[27-Jun-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@Caglio I can't give thoughts until I see something on their VC funding.

[27-Jun-19 12:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
haven't seen anything other than a photo of their own print vc funds letter etc.

[27-Jun-19 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or you can point me to something which gives more info on vc funds etc claims.
