Im just talking about the technological component, namely the smart contract for stacking! Lets look at our competitors. Binance, it seems to me that they have added a reward function for the 14-day stacking to fill the liquidity with their still illiquid DEX, why dont we implement something similar but with your fantastic traditional approach @jl777c

[26-Oct-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
taking custody of user funds is not possible without all the KYC/AML issues

[26-Oct-19 06:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
and liability issues

[26-Oct-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant smart contract the actual crypto coins, they would need to be deposited

[26-Oct-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
binance "DEX" is a proxy dex, right?

[26-Oct-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
not really comparable to atomicDEX

[26-Oct-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is 2014 tech, not even sure if they use automated multisig like MGW did

@jl777c  how difficult is the implementation of a broker based on artificial intelligence inside AtomicDEX to automatically configure trading strategies and exchange without active user participation? There is just a decentralized AI project from SingularityNET on the market, but I dont know how their model is interoperable with our project

[26-Oct-19 06:24 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'd like to see a Komodo NFT, like Blockchain Art, for example.

[26-Oct-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
@Flint you do understand that binance "DEX", people need to deposit their coins to get tokens. so they can do centralized things with the funds. with our true atomicDEX, the liquidity is the sum of the user orders

[26-Oct-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
we already support NFT

[26-Oct-19 06:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Privatoshi  #cc-assets

[26-Oct-19 06:25 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Lol I'm never surprised.
The entire toolset is already here waiting

[26-Oct-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem with AI trading is that you are competing with the market and this means all the wall street firms using their forex algo on crypto

[26-Oct-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the mechanics of using an AI to do trading, it is not that hard, i just havent implemented it as if it cant be making money for sure, what is the point

[26-Oct-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
@Privatoshi yes, pretty close to all the tech that is needed, we have either already done it, or it is in testing phase. we just lack the resources to pursue everything in parallel

[26-Oct-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
we have done a good job with getting all these new core capabilities, but without an end user solution, it seems nobody gives us any credit for it. and making such end user solutions simply takes a lot of effort and that is where things become serialized

[26-Oct-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
still, crypto is still in infancy, and even with serial development of end user solutions, in a couple years we will have quite the amazing solution in place

@jl777c  or maybe AI is being developed in its own infrastructure for a wide range of tasks? Indeed, in the coming years it will become a very relevant area without which it will be impossible to be competitive!

[26-Oct-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, a general purpose AI framework could be a useful thing, i was toying around with a modified mining approach where new coins are mined only when a better model is created. but that all comes down to the dataset that the AI is needing to work in and really a blockchain is not the best place for AI

[26-Oct-19 06:32 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I was able to use a Google Pixel, and modify it to run a more secure Android OS & hardened apps such as the browser & pdf viewer & messaging, and run SilentDragon for Android (Hush)... to connect to a desktop full node and send zaddrs.. we call it the HushDroid

[26-Oct-19 06:34 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Just something different I enjoy doing

[26-Oct-19 06:34 AM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  and in matters of cloud computing, the project will rely on AWS for the time being, or are its own developments? Something viable like Golem? To attract PC users with leased capacities of their devices to the community, this will be useful for the project in many matters

[26-Oct-19 06:36 AM] Flint#6435
and is the structure of acyclic graphs better for AI? If so, are there graph specialists in the team?

[26-Oct-19 06:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Flint   This is something I‚Äôve been digging into.  ( distributed computing ) , specifically for one kind of task,  ( password cracking ) but the model for the coin behind it is the same . Basically donate computing power , get a coin, coin is used to vote on priority of job orders .  Value of coin is based  on customers marginal utility of the computation service .

[26-Oct-19 06:39 AM] Flint#6435
@Privatoshi  Wow! tell us more about it! How realistic is it to create a fully protected version of the OS that is economically unprofitable to attack?

[26-Oct-19 06:40 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Lol

[26-Oct-19 06:41 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I never said about being attacked

[26-Oct-19 06:43 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Hardening your device or browser or whatever, is meant to prevent info from leaking, as well

[26-Oct-19 06:44 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Data is worth money, is it not?

[26-Oct-19 06:45 AM] Flint#6435
@polycryptoblog  something so far none of all such projects have failed! Although technically its not so difficult - its more likely due to the fact that after the ICO, developers have no time to further promote their projects while they travel to Lamborghini in Monaco! After all, this does not even apply to currencies, but simply use tokens to pay for services that are not there! But the stupid "investors" made the pump and there are no working projects since the general recession in the market weakened the teams that did not sell everything for the sake of the yacht!

[26-Oct-19 06:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Will be worth a lot more when it‚Äôs coinified

[26-Oct-19 06:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Flint  a lot of it has to do with crappy coin parameter design.  Like building a house on a crappy foundation,  gridcoin / folding coin and others suffer from this

[26-Oct-19 06:48 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I believe in privacy. Our phones reveal most about us, out of everything we use.

[26-Oct-19 06:49 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I always noticed that sending zaddrs using a mobile device, wasn't an option.

[26-Oct-19 06:50 AM] Flint#6435
only pixel architecture supports such customization? When will any Linux gurus release a full-featured crypto-linux?)) Although the question of dependencies of recently released crypto applications that have not yet been tested is complicated

[26-Oct-19 06:50 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I think there might be a full linux phone

[26-Oct-19 06:50 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Ubuntu,  I think

[26-Oct-19 06:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
There is the Finney Blockchain Phone

[26-Oct-19 06:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
It's like $1500 lol

[26-Oct-19 06:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Closed source

[26-Oct-19 06:52 AM] Privatoshi#9487
The first guys to design custom ROMs, were Lineage

[26-Oct-19 06:53 AM] Privatoshi#9487
The most important difference in tech between the regular OS and a more secure difference, is no Google Apps.

[26-Oct-19 06:53 AM] Privatoshi#9487
No Google Play Store

[26-Oct-19 06:53 AM] Privatoshi#9487
No Google Maps

[26-Oct-19 06:54 AM] Privatoshi#9487
No GAPPS

[26-Oct-19 06:55 AM] Flint#6435
@Privatoshi  The desktop environment is not difficult to modify for mobile devices, it may even integrate old proven Electrum, but in linux the issue of dependencies between libraries and applications is very important, and in the case of crypto applications this is even more difficult since there is not enough time to implement all the compatibility and dependencies in such in the same convenient form as in iOS, remember the first versions of Android and what can we say about Linux on mobile devices where energy optimization is important

[26-Oct-19 06:55 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm interested in cc-pegs

[26-Oct-19 06:57 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Well last I looked, on first boot there are 10 apps, or so

[26-Oct-19 06:58 AM] Privatoshi#9487
The settings are limited.

[26-Oct-19 07:00 AM] Flint#6435
@Privatoshi  Finney? Yes, there are those, but have you heard how the main investor and ideologist of this company, after a successful ICO, sold its tokens, brought it to fiat and gained huge tracts of land in Israel? So further development of the project and support are in questionüòè

[26-Oct-19 07:02 AM] Privatoshi#9487
With Hush, there is a 3d printed Dragon that runs a full node & power supply. And you could use SilentDragon on mobile to connect to the full node, and send private txs

[26-Oct-19 07:02 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Because running a full node on a mobile device, is not possible.

[26-Oct-19 07:03 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I dont care for these p&d's

[26-Oct-19 07:04 AM] Flint#6435
in the end, we get a decentralized OS that works completely on the cloud in a distributed and encrypted manner using post-quantum encryption, but this requires 5G - then the device will only need RAM without powerful hardware and an enhanced battery!

[26-Oct-19 07:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Lol I'm in the here and now. And what's possible down the road, will be yesterday's news, when we get to the point of using it.

[26-Oct-19 07:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I personally enjoy it.

[26-Oct-19 07:07 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@Flint what do you think of #cc-pegs ?

[26-Oct-19 07:10 AM] Bittersweet#9376
That's quite the bounce btc

[26-Oct-19 07:11 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Btc is crazy

[26-Oct-19 07:18 AM] Flint#6435
@Privatoshi  if you manage to create marketing around this as around DeFi, then in conjunction with advanced Komodo technologies this will attract a lot of investors! I suggest something like a flash mob on Twitter and other social networks to promote with an award even symbolic of several KMD! I‚Äôm personally personally ready to donate part of KMD every month for the remuneration fund of those who are promoting the project! you can create a similar fund

[26-Oct-19 07:21 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I am in some DeFi project's discords, and know a few guys there.  So i was thinking to run it by them.

[26-Oct-19 07:24 AM] Flint#6435
I wonder if Maker and Augur migrate with Ethereum in case of ETH collapse? That would be nice on the Komodo blockchain!üòÅ

[26-Oct-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
doing defi on a USD pegged chain, is probably what most people are most comfortable to do and to do that they will need KMD.

[26-Oct-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
defi that doesnt care about txfees will continue on ETH

[26-Oct-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
defi that prefers $0.0001 txfee vs $5 will use KMD

I like this. I'm going to screenshot it.

[26-Oct-19 07:26 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I dont see the allure of ETH

[26-Oct-19 07:27 AM] Privatoshi#9487
And network congestion

[26-Oct-19 07:27 AM] Privatoshi#9487
That & finance don't go together

[26-Oct-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
and by being its own coin, people can directly atomicswap the USDK and also use zaddr, all for the similarly low txfee, no need to pay GAS

[26-Oct-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
ETH is like CPU mining, much faster to make changes, but not very powerful computation. KMD is more like ASIC, where it takes longer to get things up and running, but once it does, then it is way ahead of CPU mining

[26-Oct-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i just posted about FSM CC, which would i guess be more like fpga in the mining analogy

[26-Oct-19 07:29 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Today GAS is not cheap but not expensive. But if ETH goes up, it makes NFT txs go down

[26-Oct-19 07:29 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Users stop buying

[26-Oct-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is trading at about 3x book value (the BTC it has on hand), likely that compares well and is in value investor territory

[26-Oct-19 07:31 AM] Privatoshi#9487
DeFi uses Augur, BAT, ZRX, DAI, BTC

[26-Oct-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
any defi using USD equivalent?

[26-Oct-19 07:31 AM] Privatoshi#9487
USDC & DAI

[26-Oct-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
or CNY, EUR, GOLD

[26-Oct-19 07:32 AM] Flint#6435
augur from cnhernehs DeFi - an interesting concept! The rest of the competitors were chased - the same Stox - scam from the creators of the miracle of the Finney smartphone - the same gang! It would also be great to introduce a prediction market into the Komodo ecosystem

[26-Oct-19 07:32 AM] Privatoshi#9487
DAI lending is 12%

[26-Oct-19 07:32 AM] Privatoshi#9487
DAI borrowing like 14%

[26-Oct-19 07:32 AM] Privatoshi#9487
USDC 6% or so lending

[26-Oct-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
prices CC can make prediction markets

[26-Oct-19 07:33 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Like Augur couldn't figure out lol

[26-Oct-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
we just dont have enough testers and GUI devs to make an end user product from it

[26-Oct-19 07:33 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Crazy

[26-Oct-19 07:33 AM] Privatoshi#9487
What dont we have? Lol

[26-Oct-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure

[26-Oct-19 07:34 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Chips & Dice

[26-Oct-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i think we have all the building blocks needed to build basically anything

[26-Oct-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
once the FSM CC is completed, it wont even need a new smartchain to deploy new logic

[26-Oct-19 07:35 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Can we bridge blockchains?

[26-Oct-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX does that in a way

[26-Oct-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
we can do cross chain transactions

[26-Oct-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
dualdaemon, bridges at the protocol level

[26-Oct-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX at the value level

[26-Oct-19 07:36 AM] Privatoshi#9487
That applies
