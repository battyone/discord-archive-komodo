So question: when KMD is used as base currency, does that KMD get burned? Or does it go somewhere?

[14-Jun-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if 2 parties transaction, A <-> B, one has KMD before the transaction, then afterwards, the other has it

[14-Jun-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
you think burning peoples KMD would make things better?

[14-Jun-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
charging KMD for all assetchain transactions?

[14-Jun-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
just say no, to platform taxes

[14-Jun-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
this will maximize growth in the number of projects

[14-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Zoroaster#5093
Honestly idk. I guess I‚Äôm just struggling to find the KMDs overall value. I feel@like it would be better to hold other tokens in the KMD ecosystem, like K64 & Pirate

[14-Jun-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont have billions to throw at projects to bribe them to use komodo

[14-Jun-19 05:32 PM] bishop#9773
@Zoroaster Out of curiosity, what was your initial investment thesis on KMD?

[14-Jun-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD wont be the highest ROI in the ecosystem, especially as the ecosystem grows, but it wont be the worst either. maybe it is a bit above the median? hard to predict

[14-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Zoroaster#5093
@bishop I invested in KMD based on the developer powers of @jl777c

[14-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Zoroaster#5093
There‚Äôs no one more talented in the space IMO

[14-Jun-19 05:34 PM] bishop#9773
I think you will find many here that could care about what the price/coin is today, or this year, or next and rather view the platform's potential 3-10-years down the line. I realize that is a timeframe that boggles many in cryptoland thinking things have to happen overnight but it's still very early in the space. The value of the entire cryptosphere is immaterial compared to global assets.

[14-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Zoroaster#5093
I understand. I was buying Ethereum when it was $3

[14-Jun-19 05:35 PM] bishop#9773
So if you invested based on developer talents, would you not agree that the progress made over the last 18 months has been worthwhile and certainly justifies continuing to hold?

[14-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Zoroaster#5093
I have all the confidence in the KMD ecosystem & jl777, I just don‚Äôt think the KMD token is where the real value is@going to end up

[14-Jun-19 05:36 PM] bishop#9773
and there is nothing wrong with diversifying your KMD stash into asset chains,...

[14-Jun-19 05:36 PM] bishop#9773
you're still supporting the komodo platform

[14-Jun-19 05:36 PM] JimD#9272
KMD has stated that everything they do is geared towards creating use cases for the token

[14-Jun-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is likely that the sum of the value of all the ecosystem projects will be more than KMD itself, but unlike other platforms that doesnt create any fundamental probkems

[14-Jun-19 05:37 PM] bishop#9773
hell, wasn't DEX worth more than KMD's market cap at one point last year?

[14-Jun-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it was for a brief time

[14-Jun-19 05:37 PM] bishop#9773
definitely brief

[14-Jun-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD cant value transfer from ecosystem projects to itself by force, unlike the other platforms that can. and this has already happened

[14-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Zoroaster#5093
So KMD miners sell their KMD to speculators for KMD assetchain tokens like K64 & Pirate that have some actual utilityüßê

[14-Jun-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD becomes a platform for the best projects who care about actual usage

[14-Jun-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i think KMD becomes the unit of trade in the ecosystem. not all would want any specific assetchain

[14-Jun-19 05:40 PM] willofleo#7505
I .think DEX will really do alot for KMDs value

[14-Jun-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but via KMD you can go from any assetchain to any other

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[14-Jun-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and it could be that two DEX swaps will get you a better price than a direct swap between two assetchains, due to spreads and liquidity

[14-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the issue of picking the right ecosystem project is that you can end up picking some that do worse than KMD

[14-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so the easier way to benefit from ecosystem growth is via KMD

[14-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
those who are confident in their project selection skills can go all in on the highest ROI project

[14-Jun-19 05:41 PM] bishop#9773
James, sell me some bulk verus, stat!

[14-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810

[14-Jun-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont have any for sale

[14-Jun-19 05:42 PM] bishop#9773
(this displeases me)

[14-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i think people underestimate the value of liquidity. that seems to be the only value LTC has

[14-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yet it is a pretty large value

[14-Jun-19 05:43 PM] Zoroaster#5093
Well for what it‚Äôs worth @jl777c I truly believe in you. I‚Äôll always keep a little KMD in my stack.

[14-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is impossible to predict all the details

[14-Jun-19 05:45 PM] jspook16#3059
I see kmd as the base coin for the ecosystem. That's how I've been using it. It does not have to be that way but I think the majority of people will see it that way too

[14-Jun-19 05:46 PM] jspook16#3059
That should give it some value

[14-Jun-19 05:50 PM] jspook16#3059
I'm just saying the ecosystem does drive kmd to be the base coin. I think it just naturally falls into place that way. And the typical user will probably feel comfortable that way when exploring other ACs

[14-Jun-19 05:52 PM] joe2x4#5987
What gives KMD value
1, 5% interest on hodl
2, Future Profit Revenue paid in kmd
3, Vote power in elections
4, Liquidity on DEX
5, Asset chains bring more users and devs to help system.
6, Jl777 Dev extraordinar 
7, Current network effect and momentum.
8, Tech that scales
9, A team that has your back, ie: most recent hack
10, Computer Genie says so. üòú

[14-Jun-19 05:56 PM] jspook16#3059
Liquidity on Dex is a major point I think with all of the regulations coming down.  When Dex in general comes into wide usage kmd ecosystem will be in a good position to receive alot of that traffic. If kmd naturally becomes the major base pair I think that will drive alot of value

[14-Jun-19 05:57 PM] bishop#9773
Has there been a new public testing date on mm2? I know the Agama issue set things back and then obviously this weekend's fork

[14-Jun-19 05:59 PM] jspook16#3059
I've continued to test. I think others have too

[14-Jun-19 06:08 PM] jspook16#3059
Does anyone know if hyperdex is adding mm2 usage? I'm thinking a desktop application will be critical

[14-Jun-19 06:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD being major base player can be seen from the examples of DigitalPrice an Graviex

[14-Jun-19 06:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
DigitalPrice made first KMD base pairs to my knowledge on a centralised exchange

[14-Jun-19 06:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it gained so much user base for KMD traders in short amount of time

[14-Jun-19 06:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and PIRATE/KMD gained even more because of that

[14-Jun-19 06:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It gives the sign that the DEX will have far more volume on KMD base pair for it's ecosystem assetchains

[14-Jun-19 06:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, you can check #dex-hyperdex where the dev mentioned they will work on upgrading their app to use mm2.0

[14-Jun-19 06:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
AtomicDEX is basically designed for mobiles first.

[14-Jun-19 06:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's coded using modern language stacks like Flutter.io and Dart language

[14-Jun-19 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And the recent updates in these languages says that the same software stake built apps for mobiles can also be easily ported to desktop

[14-Jun-19 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so can sure expect the same applications on Desktop sometime in future.... not sure when.

[14-Jun-19 06:17 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy

[14-Jun-19 06:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
AtomiDEX is mainly focused on Lite Wallet. So it will at as a Lite Wallet and a DEX, **Over a Mobile** device!

[14-Jun-19 06:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and I expect whenever the team decide to pursue for Desktop, we can expect a Full Node DEX for Desktop using same UI experience ? ü§î I don't know, as I'm not the member of AtomicDEX dev team. üôÇ Just guessing things as per the software stake understanding....

[14-Jun-19 06:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The second is HyperDEX, which is already great UI/UX, so that I'm pretty sure will support both Lite/Full node DEX ü§î Obviously @lukechilds and @hyperDEX can shine light on this one better as they are this project's team.

I also read somewhere where @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ also said he'll be making something to make native trades via GUI using mm2.
I have no idea what he intends to do and to what extent. 
I'm just happy we'll have more choice to chose from soon enough üòâ

[14-Jun-19 06:41 PM] phm87#7395
I'd be interested to learn how to do mm2 trades without gui. RPC or sth similar

[14-Jun-19 07:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@grewalsatinder - We were talking to Graviex about adding KMD as a base pair.  Or ARRR.

[14-Jun-19 07:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Have a pin in it to follow up soon.

[14-Jun-19 07:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Chase to add $ARRR as base pair üòÄ üòâ

[14-Jun-19 07:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
1. ARRR
2. KMD

[14-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
KMDLabs so undervalued :labs: No one talking about it, too damn technical for most to even comprehend what they are doing.. Graviex still determining the market value of it, seems to be floating around .15-.2 KMD

Naw it was due to the fact Binance is blocking US customers in 90 days, will have BinanceAmerica but its supposedly going to be quite limited for what alts are offered so binance alts are dumping

[14-Jun-19 07:31 PM] Markus#5464
Okay why do they have to dump tho, cant americans withdraw and just use another exchange?

[14-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Markus#5464
BNB i understand but most of other coins are listed on other exchanges aswell

[14-Jun-19 07:33 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Just how the market reacts to supposed bad news, those damn irrational crypto markets :9756_AppJedi:

[14-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Markus#5464
Well thats fine, let them dump ill pick up some cheap kmd meanwhile

[14-Jun-19 07:36 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully whalebro is not american

[14-Jun-19 07:36 PM] Markus#5464
that would suck for kmd's liquidity on binance

[14-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Anyone who cares about KMD, including whalebro, will most likely end up switching to BarterDEX as the liquidity for KMD and ecosystem will be largest there I'd assume

[14-Jun-19 07:43 PM] Markus#5464
Ye sure question is when that will happen tho

[14-Jun-19 07:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
facebook crypto whitepaper coming june 18th. maybe we'll see if it can be compatible with mm2

[14-Jun-19 08:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
that's an interesting point

[14-Jun-19 08:13 PM] willofleo#7505
yes that can be interesting if fbcoin can be on mm2

[14-Jun-19 08:13 PM] willofleo#7505
