üò≠ I'm not ready for this. I don't have enough KMD yet

[17-Oct-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
nice, one of the most volume days in binance history

[17-Oct-18 01:02 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it bad just looking at the smaller buys he chucking about. shadow my portfolio üò¶

[17-Oct-18 01:02 PM] snowdamn#2414
can't share my private index, but i can assure you KMD is outperforming 
hard to accept/see because of how much lower we are from ATH, but, trust me, it's true
in short, you are most likely better off having sold pretty much any other crypto end of 2017 than KMD üòâ

[17-Oct-18 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this is really significant for KMD

[17-Oct-18 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
such high volume at bottom is significative imo

[17-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Glad I felt the fomo the past week

Yeah Ta is good but cannot predict a whale waking up 1 day and putting a 350btc wall up lol

[17-Oct-18 01:30 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Is there any way to merge two charts together on tradingview? I want to have both price histories of bittrex and binance in one

[17-Oct-18 01:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
like an index

[17-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Japesmith#0609
TA tends to come down to "it might go up, down, or sideways" ... Which I already knew üëç

[17-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Japesmith#0609
Fite me irl

[17-Oct-18 01:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i find ta useful when every body sees the same. like btcs giant falling wedge etc ppl trade to it

[17-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Japesmith#0609

[17-Oct-18 01:47 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
So, who here caught the bottom?

[17-Oct-18 01:47 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I certainly didn't .____.

[17-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I caught the ICO bottom :abusedsmily:

[17-Oct-18 01:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
lul, doesn't count

[17-Oct-18 01:50 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I found kmd around summer 2017 and charts before that upset me

[17-Oct-18 01:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bought the bottom, then overpaid for pirate, does it still count then?

[17-Oct-18 01:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
bought the bottom to buy the top sounds standard

abusedsmily 

[17-Oct-18 01:52 PM] Japesmith#0609
@Hollowman9000 I bought at ICO when I was new to all this. Sold for a quick profit on cryptox, cos everyone was telling me JL was evil etc.

[17-Oct-18 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That's harsh

[17-Oct-18 01:53 PM] Yassin#3685

its not that no moon yet, the price needs to do a steady rise, if we pump again like we have done in the past, then a huge correction will come next, like it has done in the past too

[17-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have time

[17-Oct-18 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we need sustained continuation... build supports, create a trend.

[17-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hodl!

[17-Oct-18 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i do think that this big volume in such a low price its quite interesting. Some big whale noticed used and is accumulating before news or fomo hit, which is nice.

[17-Oct-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
@Japesmith for real? you sold because people told you i was evil?

[17-Oct-18 01:56 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
There is also still a chance that btc will go down, small but it's possible. to around 4-5k. That would drag kmd down too at least in usd value

[17-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers what if it's a big company that needs 5000 blockchains notarized

[17-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And they are saving up so they can pay the fees with rewards?

[17-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Japesmith#0609
@jl777c Not that exact wording. It was like "you should sell while it's up. JL is a known scammer" sort of thing

[17-Oct-18 01:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it can be anything, the reasons are not important, but the accumulation is getting written in the price history and that is what will have an effect in the future.

Saying you'd move on and kmd would die. All of that.

[17-Oct-18 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well the trading group I occasionally post on told me ‚Äúgood luck with the verus scam‚Äù even after I posted Mike T.‚Äôs LinkedIn üôÑ

[17-Oct-18 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Everything is scam to everyone

[17-Oct-18 01:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its funny that those same groups then go on and invest in obvious hyped scams.

This Komodo scam is still going strong after two years. Still waiting people no longer making a profit to get out. /s

[17-Oct-18 02:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve held enough scam coins to know the difference

[17-Oct-18 02:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Once you have been in this eco sysytem a while and seen all the stuff going on you basically see that 99% of other projects are just hyped up fluff. the real stuff is created here

[17-Oct-18 02:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$ARRR still looks like my biggest gamble so far

[17-Oct-18 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dPoW is the greatest .... the implications of what it does are crazy ... 
I am working on a chain atm, that a single person can only mine, send any data into it, have it dpowd and then have a copy of that data always verifiable against KMD/BTC to prove its untampered.

[17-Oct-18 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we dont even know what this stuff will be used for yet
