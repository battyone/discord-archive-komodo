I agree as well.  I’m not a fan of sitting back and waiting on nothing.  We’ve waited two years for a marketing team to do something, went through three different agencies, and then were told this marketing company would be great.  Provided us no timelines on deliverables, dropped the new website out of no where, and hasn’t had any public action since.

Thank you

[01-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Caglio#3337
But we gave them only 2 years... I mean whats 2 years when only the sky is the limit

[01-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Caglio#3337
Maybe if they had 5-10 more years

[01-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
They just don't want to pay up the money they'd have to pay to some of the promoters to get the word out, unfortunately in today's world that is just something you have to do

[01-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Caglio#3337
Or maybe when my unborn child starts college

[01-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
no choice really

[01-Aug-19 02:49 PM] dan.#2473
he's probably gonna give me a good choice of words later, but james must be super smooth with the ladies, just saying

[01-Aug-19 02:49 PM] grumpygoron#4320
<< Runs marketing company.  Would 100% be fired from any client that I spent over 6 month’s launching a website

I have a feeling people here have no real idea of life

[01-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Caglio#3337
They have skills in computers

[01-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Caglio#3337
however lacking normal social skills

[01-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I think the main thing they still don't realize is that you can have the best tech in the world and it will probably be ingnored if you can't get word out

[01-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Whole this situation is tragic to a normal person

[01-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Sdunbar#5064
eventually that realization will sink in

[01-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont even get how can someone defend such a shitty marketing, liek clueless kids

[01-Aug-19 02:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes mate

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, you are dumb

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@mrtzmp3 aside from his bluntness what is he saying that you disagree with?

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
mrtzmp3 how long have you been buyin KMD?

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337
you are simply an imbecile

[01-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Caglio#3337
end of a story

[01-Aug-19 02:53 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
He basically mental , saying what ever other bagholder from any project is saying , we need marketing so he can drop his heavy bags on the next fool. In meantime complaining about the dumpers

[01-Aug-19 02:53 PM] grumpygoron#4320
That’s not what he’s saying

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Sdunbar#5064
im getting the feeling mrtzmp3 has not been buyin kmd that long. maybe got in this year?

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Bottom buyer

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 here you are putting words in my mouth, which is something people do when they lose argument

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Sdunbar#5064
so there you go

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Sdunbar#5064
thats why your opinion is much different than those that have seen it all through 2016,2017 etc

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Sdunbarbut was luck more than anything

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Thing is, when I first went to invest in Komodo, if I knew such a moronic ideas are behind it, I would never do

[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] dan.#2473
in the teams defense, almost the entire market is underwater btc wise, except many of the top 20. But, doesn't change the fact they don't know what they are doing. Like @grumpygoron  said, objectively this is almost like umm what is going on

[01-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Caglio#3337
They have no idea what they are doing, they know to code, and thats all

[01-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Caglio#3337
everything else sucks

[01-Aug-19 02:55 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ok buy top of bubble , probably illinformed about the market at whole. Why is it kmd fault??

[01-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Caglio#3337
and eventually their coding wont matter at all

[01-Aug-19 02:55 PM] dan.#2473
ive been here since supernet ico

[01-Aug-19 02:55 PM] dan.#2473
did you guys know supernet used to be a top 20 coin?

[01-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Caglio#3337
Some will end up working for coins with future, some will kill themseves

[01-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Dude, we have a product now

[01-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
And noone knows about it, or ever will

[01-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
So who is idiot here ?

[01-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
We who have coin noone appreciates or ever will

[01-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Or justin sun and his tron ?

[01-Aug-19 02:57 PM] dan.#2473
This is almost like the mobile app early days. I made $$$$$$$ back when marketing wasnt important. but the amount of chinese devs and marketing, drowns the independent coders out of the market

[01-Aug-19 02:57 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Yeah I don’t care about rankings or other coin price.  I’m in this discord for KMD.  I don’t care if other coins are getting hurt as well, I’m here for KMD.  When KMD is doing nothing except going down I want to see the team try to fight that.  There is not effort put forth to change the current market situation or use this “down time” to gain more public attention to KMD.  We are constantly getting left behind by our own team who doesn’t think marketing is important and an agency that doesn’t do their job of marketing

[01-Aug-19 02:57 PM] c2k#4915
@Caglio not sure if you follow stocks but high yielding stocks are not "growth" stocks. people buy them for the dividend. if you think of KMD in terms of a dividend paying stock, and not a "growth"  company, you can adjust your expectations. I.E. slow steady price up/down/sideways with relatively low volatility, not explosive at all...and all you care about it the dividends - or in this case the rewards.

If you want a growth company this isnt likely it for you.

[01-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
5% rewards no good if you lose 50% on the principle

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
I lost much more than 50%

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] p.#1126
lol

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
Much much more

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] p.#1126
someone post the definition of PONZI

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] dan.#2473
what is the definition of the dividend stocks though. I've heard this story with supernet

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
However, as far as I know

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
There was bitcoin dark ?

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
or something like that ?

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
what happened with that coin ?

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] dan.#2473
yes there was

[01-Aug-19 02:59 PM] dan.#2473
it turned into kmd basically

[01-Aug-19 03:00 PM] p.#1126
scary

[01-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Cool, I thought it died and new coin started

[01-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Cos soon enough with amazing garbage marketing

[01-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Caglio#3337
we will buy kmd 1/1 with cardano

[01-Aug-19 03:00 PM] p.#1126
flip flop projects sucking investors dry at each turn???

[01-Aug-19 03:00 PM] p.#1126
hahhaha

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Imagine this, the best tech ever

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
5% rewards

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
dPoW

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
everything

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Just the 5% rewards should be enough

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Imagine if ether have it ?

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
or ltc ?

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] dan.#2473
dPoW is cool as fuck

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
They would be mooning

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
But our marketing team made a web page

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm....

[01-Aug-19 03:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think you guys are over reacting. kmd is like 10 cents away from the top 40. it has survived and persisted while dozens of other competitive projects have fallen into obscurity. It's not going to 10 cents. It's frustrating for everyone to not get recognized for real achievments when copy pasted shitcoins and various vaporware scams are eating your lunch. But hey, everyone wanted a rebrand. And you got one. price didnt pump. tough shit. welcome to crypto.

[01-Aug-19 03:02 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Was a rebrand really that desired?  I don’t think I’ve seen many people ask for it or understand why it was needed

[01-Aug-19 03:02 PM] grumpygoron#4320
It seemed like it was this marketing team’s idea honestly 😂

[01-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dan.#2473
what most wanted was an effective campaign to get more people involved with kmd

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Caglio#3337
I think that 5% scheme was the best thing they ever did

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] p.#1126
and yet

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Caglio#3337
If we didnt have that from the start, noone would be in it

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] p.#1126
the logo screams

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] p.#1126
exit

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Caglio#3337
Hahah exactly p

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] p.#1126
lack of effort

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
well there's free money available if you wanna host a kmd meetup

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Caglio#3337
If I host a kmd meetup, I would probably beat up few people and end up in prison

[01-Aug-19 03:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
almost no takers on that marketing push

[01-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Caglio#3337
First would be someone frm marketing team, then someone defending him

[01-Aug-19 03:04 PM] p.#1126
lets put a year + into coming up with a logo that resembles a "C"

[01-Aug-19 03:04 PM] p.#1126
turquoise

[01-Aug-19 03:04 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Duh, the C is for Comodo

[01-Aug-19 03:05 PM] p.#1126
ICX mixed with VERGE logo
