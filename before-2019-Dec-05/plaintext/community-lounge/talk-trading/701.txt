The retail people made so faking lot of money is the funny part

[30-May-19 01:11 AM] 차미숙#8912
Becuz they don't know how to sell their coin

[30-May-19 01:11 AM] 차미숙#8912
They were like old people

[30-May-19 01:11 AM] 차미숙#8912

i found a darkcoin wallet on my old laptop probably from the cryptsy days. no transactions for the address though

[30-May-19 01:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
They bought ripple when it was 0.1cent

[30-May-19 01:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
MLM people sold it for 0.3 cent

[30-May-19 01:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
Hodled it cuz they can't sell it

[30-May-19 01:15 AM] 차미숙#8912

[30-May-19 01:18 AM] bishop#9773
Instamine =/= premine fwiw

[30-May-19 01:18 AM] bishop#9773
and then they compounded the issue by changing the supply constraints

Remember ethtrade?

[30-May-19 01:19 AM] heguli97#5781
interesting price action today, probably should get me a few hundred KMD 😉

[30-May-19 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
@bishop what it the difference between instamine and premine by your definition?

[30-May-19 01:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
a pre fork bch buy is finally paying off it looks like

[30-May-19 01:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
Some people actually argue that all bitcoin is just like one big bitcoin

[30-May-19 01:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
Lol

[30-May-19 01:23 AM] bishop#9773
@Alright A premine is something you intentionally do. The instamine was because again, they fucked up difficulty parameters

[30-May-19 01:24 AM] bishop#9773
So two really large issues with the launch. Personally, I have always been shocked it wasn't relaunched but in actuality, there was a couple years of being able to buy <$5 coins

[30-May-19 01:24 AM] 차미숙#8912
Good old days

[30-May-19 01:25 AM] bishop#9773
yeah, a trainwreck

[30-May-19 01:25 AM] bishop#9773
and then five or six months later, masternodes came out officially

[30-May-19 01:25 AM] 차미숙#8912
What would I be if there weren't crypto

[30-May-19 01:25 AM] bishop#9773

[30-May-19 01:26 AM] 차미숙#8912
I know

[30-May-19 01:26 AM] 차미숙#8912
I would work there instead of mcdonalds

[30-May-19 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
@bishop still don't understand what you mean by instamine

[30-May-19 01:27 AM] bishop#9773
faster blocks than the parameters were called for and the difficulty adjustment didn't come into play to slow things down

[30-May-19 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
I am thankful every day that jl saved me from wage cuckery 🙌

[30-May-19 01:28 AM] 차미숙#8912
Naw don't do business

[30-May-19 01:28 AM] 차미숙#8912

the only thing that has come close to crypto gains is buying property. but that has been way more work than anticipated. nothing is free in the end.

It's tiring but fun

[30-May-19 01:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
using gains to put a home together whether buying or building is a definitely solid move.

[30-May-19 01:39 AM] 차미숙#8912
I think at least one is a must

[30-May-19 01:39 AM] 차미숙#8912

[30-May-19 01:41 AM] Alecandro#1179
I’m digging that KMD didn’t just instantly drop back down again

[30-May-19 01:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah no shit, there's a bunch of em up here

[30-May-19 01:42 AM] 차미숙#8912
They aren't stupid. They just try to save cost for themselves lol

[30-May-19 01:42 AM] 차미숙#8912
Sly people

[30-May-19 01:42 AM] 차미숙#8912
Using shitty materials and all

[30-May-19 01:43 AM] yorklab#7270
@Alecandro And this is before any really big announcements. Maybe this is just a warmup?

[30-May-19 01:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
shitty materials, tools, workmanship. will charge you top dollar and disappear.

Lately after all the 2018 mess, i came to a thesis that all crypto sort of goes together right?

[30-May-19 01:44 AM] 차미숙#8912
So that makes new IEO or ICO the inflation rate

[30-May-19 01:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
Just like fiat

[30-May-19 01:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
Issue new coins out of the whole system

[30-May-19 01:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
And that acts as money sucking machine so therefore inflation  rate

[30-May-19 01:49 AM] 차미숙#8912
Oh rly

[30-May-19 01:50 AM] 차미숙#8912
Satoshism

[30-May-19 01:50 AM] 차미숙#8912
And then ICO every sunday

[30-May-19 01:51 AM] 차미숙#8912

One of my bucket list was to make a fat ass satoshi temple in the middle of a city

[30-May-19 01:53 AM] 차미숙#8912
And then crypto people would come and pray every sunday

[30-May-19 02:41 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Love to see this price growth, good thing there’s only 3-5 more years until the rebrand launches and some real public marketing starts
