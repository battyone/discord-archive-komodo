I do think the team is in the midst of getting Komodo noticed and we'll see that in the coming months; I'm hoping it coincides with a bull market. I'm still very positive, but the current price is a bit disheartening.

[20-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The price is ridiculous

[20-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> The price is good

[20-Jul-18 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Specially when we have the first crypto conditions smart contracts being act8vely developed

[20-Jul-18 01:36 PM] jorian#4555
in bear market? i'd be surprised if such news would moon KMD

[20-Jul-18 01:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
Has the team released their real names/identities yet?

[20-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Most are known @meatspoon

[20-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Why do you care who @jl777c is?

[20-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Trying to send in the doorkickers?

[20-Jul-18 01:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@meatspoon who cares?

[20-Jul-18 01:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
It doesn't concern you at all that the developers are unwilling to attach their names and reputations to this project whose price has been falling like a stone for half a year?

[20-Jul-18 01:44 PM] yorklab#7270
To be fair, just about everything has been falling during that time.

[20-Jul-18 01:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
true, but KMD is like the heaviest stone cast into the bottomless abyss

[20-Jul-18 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What does the developers names have to do with price?

[20-Jul-18 01:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
I was optimistic at first during the big pump of Dec, as we all were.  But I have grown more skeptical.  At first keeping identities secret seemed like something that a reasonable person *might* do to avoid potential theft, kidnapping or whatever.  But what was the Wild West is quickly being civilized and the KMD team continues to wear bandanas over their faces saying, "buy the dip, guys!"

[20-Jul-18 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What does identity have to do with the tech?

[20-Jul-18 01:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
its about accountability, Siu.  Imagine you were going to hire me to do work that I claimed I was qualified to do but I refused to tell you my name or show you my face.  Would you not care and still hire me?

[20-Jul-18 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Code is open source. you can verify it yourself

[20-Jul-18 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Accountability? For what?

[20-Jul-18 01:48 PM] grumpygoron#4320
That‚Äôs not a great way to convince potential investors...‚Äùjust verify the code yourself!‚Äù

[20-Jul-18 01:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
dude, stop being obtuse.  i am not a programmer, i cant verify code.  If KMD falls apart due to complete incompetence, the programmers can walk away without any hit to their reputation because no one knows who they are

[20-Jul-18 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If kmd falls appart?

[20-Jul-18 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why?

[20-Jul-18 01:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
is there a language barrier here, Siu?

[20-Jul-18 01:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If btc falls appart no one can get to satoshi and make him accountable... yet btc got you here.

[20-Jul-18 01:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
are you honestly comparing KMD to BTC?

[20-Jul-18 01:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Do you understand how revolutionary the tech being built here is?

[20-Jul-18 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes. im comparing it? Are you trolling?

[20-Jul-18 01:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
clearly no.  and no one else does either because the market value of this obscure tech that no one seems to value is dropping like panties at a frat party

[20-Jul-18 01:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
comparing KMD to BTC is like comparing a midget amputee to a super model

[20-Jul-18 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, like everything else in this same market

[20-Jul-18 01:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
no, not like everything else.  Some alts have lost 25%, some 30%.  KMD has lost what, 85%  The marketing is non existent, the wallet is weak, barterdex is unusable by common people

[20-Jul-18 01:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Kmd is actually building on top of btc tech, unlike every other project that is trying to reinvent the wheel with their own vision of what a blockchain

[20-Jul-18 01:51 PM] grumpygoron#4320
It‚Äôs really not like everything else.  I‚Äôm invested in a range of various coins and have been in Komodo as it‚Äôs one of the only ones with workin tech but yet the price has taken the biggest hit.

[20-Jul-18 01:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Btc has lost 80%

[20-Jul-18 01:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
right.  KMD is recycling the wheel to try and be relevant.  We have no idea at all if the market values BTC notary services

[20-Jul-18 01:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The market give value to EOS... go buy some

[20-Jul-18 01:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
yup.  language barrier I see

[20-Jul-18 01:53 PM] grumpygoron#4320
We‚Äôve been asking for stronger marketing and early this year Komodo announced some girl was the new head of marketing then nothing came from it.  Lots of coins have gone down in price but here we all say how revolutionary KMD is yet there is no market response.  Saying ‚Äúgo buy another coin‚Äù or ‚Äújust sell Komodo then‚Äù is childish

[20-Jul-18 01:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
so, Siu, what we have here are two opinions.  You have drank the coolaid and feel that there is no reason to be skeptical or question anything.  I think its good to be skeptical and question things.  which do you think is more dangerous?

[20-Jul-18 01:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have not drank the coolaid

[20-Jul-18 01:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I know kmd has a marketing problem.

[20-Jul-18 01:54 PM] grumpygoron#4320
I love the tech behind Komodo as do all of us but I feel these concerns and questions are valid as investors

[20-Jul-18 01:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
like Relyt said, they hired "some girl."  I wonder if she had a name.  If she didn't, how can one even verify that they hired anyone?  That is the problem with not using names.  Nothing can be verified and no one can be held accountable

[20-Jul-18 01:55 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@meatspoon they did have a picture of her, could probably dig around and find it

[20-Jul-18 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No, there is no "some girl" hired.

[20-Jul-18 01:56 PM] yorklab#7270
I think the team is aware of the issues stated. To me the biggest issues are: 
1. A large partner actually using Komodo's platform
2. Easy to use GUIs.
You have those two things and it will market itself. Looking at the latest posts from the team it appears to me they are working on both.

[20-Jul-18 01:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
How would you know, Siu, if they hired or didnt hire anyone?  How could you possibly confirm that if no one has names or identities?

[20-Jul-18 01:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You can talk at #komodo-team about marketing

[20-Jul-18 01:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ah, is that the guy's name?  #komodo-team, nice to meet you!!

[20-Jul-18 01:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Marketing head is not anonymous

[20-Jul-18 01:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Actually mostly none of the team is not anonymous

[20-Jul-18 01:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Only jl777

[20-Jul-18 01:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, that joker better be working 80 hour weeks, because if his name is attached to this project and it goes to crap, he won't get hired anywhere again

[20-Jul-18 01:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Head of marketing is Steve Lee.

[20-Jul-18 01:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok... so you are trolling now

[20-Jul-18 01:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
no, not trolling,  frustrated

[20-Jul-18 01:58 PM] freakbros#9074
U calling James a joker

[20-Jul-18 01:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
James?  I thought it was Steve?

[20-Jul-18 01:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah.m. that means a bottom is near... and thats fine. You can be frustrated

[20-Jul-18 01:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
A bottom is certainly near for BTC.  not sure about KMD

[20-Jul-18 01:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Steve Lee is the CMO

[20-Jul-18 02:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
freakbros said it was James.  I don't particularly care if it is Steve or James, but whatever his name is, he better be burning the midnight oil

[20-Jul-18 02:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
James lee is the pseudonism of jl777

[20-Jul-18 02:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Jl777 doesnt need anyone to hire him

[20-Jul-18 02:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
haha, riiiiight.  Nothing weird there, having a pseudonym for a screenname

[20-Jul-18 02:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He is the one hiring

[20-Jul-18 02:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hahah

[20-Jul-18 02:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Emmanuel, I am not trying to sell you on a product, tech or service

[20-Jul-18 02:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
this is about trading.  Price action is central to trading

[20-Jul-18 02:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah. . Trolling at the bottom of a price move... what a surprise

[20-Jul-18 02:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
like I said, i dont think we are at the bottom of KMD's price move

[20-Jul-18 02:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
I think we are about a buck fifty away from the bottom

[20-Jul-18 02:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I remember when LTC was dead because btc bottomed first

[20-Jul-18 02:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Went from $8 to like $3 in a week and everyone gave up

[20-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Trolls in trading? Good sign of a bottom.

[20-Jul-18 02:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am not giving up.  I am holding my KMD until it goes to zero or until I can turn a profit on it.  So I will go down with the ship if it goes down.  But I admit I get triggered by wildly optimistic people who have no problem with anonymous devs

[20-Jul-18 02:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Beefspoon will say that im crazy comparing kmd to ltc

[20-Jul-18 02:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
LTC is massively more established than KMD

[20-Jul-18 02:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
you keep comparing KMD to projects that the world knows about and values

[20-Jul-18 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you have a problem with anonymous devs you should sell your crypto and store your money in a fdic insured bank

[20-Jul-18 02:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
don't equate me with a statist

[20-Jul-18 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Were you there when ltx was only a year old?

[20-Jul-18 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ltc*

[20-Jul-18 02:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
I dunno, Siu, but I wasnt giving handies to JL777 like you were

[20-Jul-18 02:06 PM] yorklab#7270
@meatspoon, don't you agree that the team also agree that improvements need to be made and are in the process of doing that?

[20-Jul-18 02:06 PM] yorklab#7270
Marketing, GUIs, etc.

[20-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Meyse#0952
names and identities arent important at all in a decentralized world we are all striving for. if you see the tech that is being developed you will know kmd has a bright future

[20-Jul-18 02:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
yorklab, i agree that they have said they are going to do things... that havent been done... for a while.

[20-Jul-18 02:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Emmanuel, if people valued anonymity in devs, they would be all over KMD like white on rice

[20-Jul-18 02:07 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@yorklab I do like that they admit there is an issue but we‚Äôve been hearing about this ‚Äúprocess‚Äù for a while now without any actual forward movement

[20-Jul-18 02:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
people value their own anonymity when transacting, thats it.  when they invest in a project they want to know who is running it

[20-Jul-18 02:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So much for being antistatist

[20-Jul-18 02:08 PM] yorklab#7270
The have hired and are currently talking to these guys about marketing and GUIs.

"I want to be anonymous. but everyone else should be transparent!"

[20-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Meyse#0952
i dont need to know who is running it. and you dont need to invest. i can see what is happening in the background which should give you confidence, if it doesnt, then maybe ripple or eos is something more to your liking ofcourse

[20-Jul-18 02:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
emmanuel, isnt the point of having crypto so that the door kickers cant take it despite kicking in doors?

[20-Jul-18 02:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
Meyse, what you can see in the background should make ME more confident?  What kind of logic is that?

[20-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Meyse#0952
how about development process?
