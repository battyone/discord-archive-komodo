[05-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah it might not go below 18k, or even 18.5k maybe

[05-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i assumed we would see hyperdumping, but we only had a dump about the size of the buy earlier today

[05-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Alecandro#1179
I mean I guess technically people could be trying to move funds there stil to dump

[05-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Alecandro#1179
but who knows

What happened to crypto

[05-Jun-19 06:26 AM] 차미숙#8912
People are satisfying with 6% gainz

[05-Jun-19 06:27 AM] 차미숙#8912
Last time I checked was when people want 6x

[05-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338
well, i WANTED you guys to tank it 30%+, it just isnt happening

[05-Jun-19 06:31 AM] 차미숙#8912
Well can you go 100x margin short?

[05-Jun-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we will be making an initial statement soon

[05-Jun-19 06:51 AM] 차미숙#8912
Man I'm so dumb

[05-Jun-19 06:51 AM] Alexfrog#1338
?

[05-Jun-19 06:53 AM] 차미숙#8912
I forgot I sent my kmd to binance thought i sent to a paper wallet. Panicked for like 2 minutes after looking at explorer and then realized I was dumb

[05-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol

[05-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its been a day of panicking

[05-Jun-19 06:54 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yes it has. Day of ups and downs lol. Break 20k! Security issue!

[05-Jun-19 06:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i dont think we wouldve gone back under 20k without the security issue 😦

[05-Jun-19 06:55 AM] Alexfrog#1338
this was the fastest ive ever gone from excited and super bullish about a coin to terrified

[05-Jun-19 06:55 AM] 차미숙#8912
You just explained a women right there

[05-Jun-19 06:56 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol

[05-Jun-19 06:57 AM] 차미숙#8912
So after James drains all accounts, if mine didn't get drained, my account is safu?

[05-Jun-19 06:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
dont know

[05-Jun-19 06:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
we all await the dev statement

[05-Jun-19 06:58 AM] 차미숙#8912
Btw the hacking is bullish

[05-Jun-19 06:58 AM] 차미숙#8912
Cuz u know I see like 6~7% of the supply in white hackers hands

[05-Jun-19 06:59 AM] 차미숙#8912
And effectively reduced the supply momentarily

[05-Jun-19 07:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
not really though, what people decide to do after they get them back matters

[05-Jun-19 07:00 AM] 차미숙#8912
Well for now the supply is reduced

[05-Jun-19 07:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but yeah, if all this shakeout does is result in a few hundred k komodo getting dumped on binance, thats not much

[05-Jun-19 07:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
looks like coins are in strong hands right now.  if it was all in traders hands they wouldve all dumped

[05-Jun-19 07:04 AM] 차미숙#8912
But i was setting my buys at 1 satoshi

[05-Jun-19 07:04 AM] 차미숙#8912
Can my dream come tru?

[05-Jun-19 07:06 AM] Alexfrog#1338
wow, they swept a lot of addresses funds into that dev safety address

[05-Jun-19 07:06 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its kindof random at first, and then they just start goign through addresses from high value down to low

[05-Jun-19 07:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ill be interested to hear the story of this night from the devs perspective 😉

[05-Jun-19 07:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
im sure its quite a story

[05-Jun-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
there was a vulnerability in upstream module of agama. we are protecting the vulnerable addresses and have 90% of it secured

☑ 

[05-Jun-19 07:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338
can you say if any funds were actually stolen yet?

[05-Jun-19 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so  far it looks like it has not been. this has been dormant for a while

[05-Jun-19 07:09 AM] Alexfrog#1338
good to hear

[05-Jun-19 07:11 AM] Alecandro#1179
Gotta say I do love how the team always seems to find these things before anything truly bad ever happens. Major props for being proactive

[05-Jun-19 07:12 AM] Alecandro#1179
Assuming that’s what happened lol

[05-Jun-19 07:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
How do we prove that we own that address?

[05-Jun-19 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
instructions will be provided

[05-Jun-19 07:14 AM] tolken#2655
Agreed, I hope they get a handle on this and no one looses any funds. Looking forward to hearing the full story once the dust settles. I’m sure there are security reasons for not revealing too much about how/what the vulnerability is.

[05-Jun-19 07:15 AM] tolken#2655
Impressed as usual with how the teams are responding though.

[05-Jun-19 07:15 AM] 차미숙#8912
We now have a kmd safu fund

[05-Jun-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
if funds went to RSgD2cmm......EHoHMywJdkbkeF your KMD was at risk, so we swept it, we are about to announce a procedure on how to claim it

[05-Jun-19 07:16 AM] 차미숙#8912
Let's go to bitmex with the safu fund and 10x it then give it back to the owners

[05-Jun-19 07:18 AM] dsalinas79#8160
Does this apply to other funds: snet, oot, pangea...?

[05-Jun-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Jun-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to sweep those yourself

[05-Jun-19 07:19 AM] dsalinas79#8160
How? Agama is not running...

Vulnerability discovered in Komodo’s Agama wallet - This is what...
We strongly recommend moving all funds from Agama (KMD, asset chain coins, and other assets) to a new address as soon as possible.

[05-Jun-19 07:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
This is like when Johoe rescued all thsoe BTC in 2014

[05-Jun-19 07:21 AM] Alexfrog#1338

When I win the ARRR lottery, I’m gonna make it rain on the Komodo team

[05-Jun-19 07:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So this only affect seeds generated on agama or ever used in agama?

[05-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Alecandro#1179
😂

[05-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also if you generated one 2 years ago or so?

[05-Jun-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
vuln was in an upstream lib agama used, so if you used agama in any mode for any coin, the address is likely vulnerable

[05-Jun-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if you logged in during recent months, yes

[05-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm better get to work then

[05-Jun-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if you use agama, sweep to a new secure address ASAP

[05-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Good day for miners probably

[05-Jun-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810

[05-Jun-19 07:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm

[05-Jun-19 07:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think some of my funds were affected

[05-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I presume the RS adress is owned by kmd team?

[05-Jun-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i control that address

[05-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok bueno, thanks 😃

[05-Jun-19 07:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Any other coins that also used that upstream lib?

[05-Jun-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea

[05-Jun-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
we are scrambling to protect the ecosystem

[05-Jun-19 07:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
step 1: protect KMD ecosystem.   step 2: hack other coins.    (j/k)

[05-Jun-19 07:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
