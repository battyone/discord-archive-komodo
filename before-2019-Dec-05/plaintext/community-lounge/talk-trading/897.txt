he stil hasn't learned

[06-Jul-19 09:16 AM] Malti#3948
I think blocking Tek was the most peaceful thing I’ve ever done

[06-Jul-19 09:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
very good portfolio. but don't forget to make bitcoin the major holding when alts go up in value, and shrink your alts size. has to be a lot more patience waiting for another alt bear season and then buy back cheaper alts increasing your stash again.

@grewalsatinder yes that’s def the strategy. But kmd and arrr are in for a good run imo

[06-Jul-19 09:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[06-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
here's another few messages that will upset malti

[06-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
I know he's gonna secretly watch em

[06-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[06-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
also i personally think your portfolio sucks

[06-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
> 0% btc/bch

[06-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[06-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Tek#5253
but yeah who cares about your 1000 bucks folio anyways rite

[06-Jul-19 09:57 AM] yorklab#7270
I'm a terrible trader/investor which explains why my average price in KMD is much higher than where it stands today. But having said that, it seems to me that this would be a good time for your portfolio to be KMD heavy.

[06-Jul-19 10:00 AM] yorklab#7270
This is the first time in a while that the price and volume increase has not been controlled by one large whale, so it seems that more investors are noticing Komodo.

rank #43 on CMC. It's been a while. Let's get to top 30 by end of july 😉

[06-Jul-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's nice to see KMD up when BTC dominance is also back to 62%+

[06-Jul-19 10:12 AM] Oszy#5734
guess it's the marketing :troll_hardcore:

[06-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Malti#3948
Honestly i think it’s now the perspective on a clear communication on what KMD is capable of.. that’s not an easy task. Big clients in the pipeline, atomicDEX, nSPV,....

[06-Jul-19 10:15 AM] Malti#3948
So I guess it’s the marketing in a way :abusedsmily:

[06-Jul-19 10:17 AM] Malti#3948
Does anyone know when beta atomicDEX will be sent to the people that signed up?

[06-Jul-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i heard next week

In the meantime. Again top 5 gainer on cmc

[06-Jul-19 10:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Who here has a google account and watches crypto youtubers when they live stream?

[06-Jul-19 10:29 AM] Malti#3948
Nope. Like edited vids better

[06-Jul-19 10:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
looking to recruit a few people to send the youtubers money and ask a KMD related question

[06-Jul-19 10:31 AM] Keppie#5156
Sometimes I watch Trevon james, the bitconnect guy. Just for laughs 😄

[06-Jul-19 10:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
lol

[06-Jul-19 10:32 AM] Keppie#5156
Not the guy you aare looking for ? :troll_cool:

[06-Jul-19 10:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Any marketing is good marketing 😃

[06-Jul-19 10:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[06-Jul-19 10:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sunny / George a few others i have seen with decent counts

[06-Jul-19 10:40 AM] Keppie#5156
Chico streams aswell me thinks

[06-Jul-19 10:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I will spend time filling it out, would be cool if i can get some help with it

[06-Jul-19 10:40 AM] Keppie#5156
Crypto daily occasionally

[06-Jul-19 10:40 AM] BlockTech#6895
Yeah, sunny decree, Ivan on tech also but not sure he answers questions in live.

[06-Jul-19 10:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Have a budget of $500 to chuck at this community effort

[06-Jul-19 10:41 AM] Malti#3948
Link the google form and when I see a person streaming I’ll put it in

[06-Jul-19 10:41 AM] Keppie#5156
Might aswell count me in. Subbed to most of em. I'll activate the bell on these streamers

[06-Jul-19 10:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
ivan wont unless we ask a very clever question 😃

[06-Jul-19 10:41 AM] Malti#3948
It can be a shared effort for sure as well. I don’t mind paying for my own question

[06-Jul-19 10:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Great thanks Keppie

[06-Jul-19 10:41 AM] Malti#3948
If it pamps the bags, then we win 😉

[06-Jul-19 10:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am happy to refund it 😃

[06-Jul-19 10:42 AM] Malti#3948
I’ll also have a look out for some live-streams!

[06-Jul-19 10:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I will try to find a online site we can keep the info on that has a calendar function

[06-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Keppie#5156
Ready to break 16k sats

[06-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Malti#3948
Maybe a list of nice questions can be created in a form. 
Question - date asked - you tuber - summary response - asked by(community member)

[06-Jul-19 10:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah, need to formulate the question for the youtuber in question. The people that watches them normally knows how to frame the question

[06-Jul-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
I think its rebrand hype

[06-Jul-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
i expect it to reach 20-25k

[06-Jul-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
before a correction

[06-Jul-19 11:08 AM] Caglio#3337
i dont think so its cos of rebrand

[06-Jul-19 11:09 AM] Caglio#3337
its usually counter effect in crypto world

[06-Jul-19 11:09 AM] Caglio#3337
price goes up after you get hacked

[06-Jul-19 11:09 AM] Markus#5464
pretty sure it is....there was fake news about rebrand 31 dec 2018 and price went crazy for a few days then dumped

[06-Jul-19 11:09 AM] Caglio#3337
and goes down after u invent someting

[06-Jul-19 11:10 AM] Markus#5464
but i dont complain....btc might be doing a moonshot aswell if Inverse head and shoulder gets completed and plays out

[06-Jul-19 11:10 AM] Markus#5464
so if btc and kmd pump at same time its awesome

[06-Jul-19 11:10 AM] Caglio#3337
