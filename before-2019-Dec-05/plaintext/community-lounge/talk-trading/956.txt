```The data is directly from netid 0 only during bear market. Displayed are the last 24 hours.
Due to low liquidity and transformation to mm2.0 there are almost no trades``` did the volume drop or move to mm2?

[22-Jul-19 01:43 PM] joe2x4#5987
Dexstats update?

[22-Jul-19 01:45 PM] joe2x4#5987
Cmc update?

[22-Jul-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
volume did drop

[22-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Markus#5464
but usually when volume drop

[22-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Markus#5464
something big is usually popping up afterwards

[22-Jul-19 01:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
@joe2x4 mm2.0 does currently not allow to read trades of other peole via api once thats possible again I will read and update dexstats to mm2 data. Once there is good volume we can activate cmc again

imagine all alt coins stop trading against btc and start trading against gold instead

[22-Jul-19 02:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
isn't Digix supposed to be Gold backed?

[22-Jul-19 02:06 PM] joe2x4#5987
This mm2 non reporting stats  is very interesting. Could be a feature, almost like a dark exchange.

[22-Jul-19 02:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
if you want nobody to know you can also trade on a netid that you don't publish
maybe you would be able to somehow match it with chainanalysis

[22-Jul-19 02:17 PM] joe2x4#5987
Sweet, I'm gathering ammo so I can concerned citizen email some "think of the children" regulators so as to make viral news with regulator turning red and shaking fist.:abusedsmily:

[22-Jul-19 02:29 PM] joe2x4#5987
I wonder if mm2 could be used to replace silk road. If say a hidden net Id is used, say 420, could drugs be posted and sold? Drugs being listed as NFT?

[22-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Neko#5830

for 'gamecards' or 'game items'

[22-Jul-19 02:35 PM] joe2x4#5987
Or in my scenario, game items equal drugs, and the game they play equals silk road plus user reputation.

[22-Jul-19 03:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
i like @joe2x4 's idea. but once mobile dex is freely accessible i dont think any advertising wil be necessary

[22-Jul-19 06:31 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
once its freely accessible then advertising will be mostnecessary

[22-Jul-19 06:31 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
we need advertising, it just has to be when we have  a set of top level products for adoption

[22-Jul-19 06:31 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so we dont fall prey to hype and death

[22-Jul-19 06:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
there is zero competition. kmd is the only one with a mobile dex exempt from kyc. it's not top level it's a level that no one else can even get to yet.

[22-Jul-19 06:44 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
yes

[22-Jul-19 06:44 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so word must be spread

[22-Jul-19 07:07 PM] Markus#5464
there is alot of improvements needed in the atomicdex

[22-Jul-19 07:08 PM] Markus#5464
for example if u want to trade KMD for BTC and there already is someone who put up a trade for that u can not set a new limit order

[22-Jul-19 07:08 PM] Markus#5464
thats a big flaw

[22-Jul-19 07:09 PM] Markus#5464
unless its a bug

[22-Jul-19 07:09 PM] Markus#5464
dont know

[22-Jul-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
GUI limitation

[22-Jul-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 certainly allows it

[22-Jul-19 07:09 PM] Markus#5464
Hm ok

[22-Jul-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
first priority is to get the phone atomic swaps stable, please understand this is something that is not exactly easy

[22-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Markus#5464
understandable, will take time for sure

[22-Jul-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
once that is working smoothly, then allowing maker orders by all, it is not so crazy, the one issue with maker orders on phones is that the phone needs to be active

[22-Jul-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is why it isnt the primary use case. the idea is there will be marketmaker competition for the nice bid/ask spreads that will be there at first

[22-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Markus#5464
I think it wont be a issue later on, im sure there will be enough liquid bots ran on computers through api

[22-Jul-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly, especially with the liquidity multiplier

[22-Jul-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
with KMD you can bank the 5%, have very low offers for dozens of coins and just wait for someone to dump/fatfinger

[22-Jul-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if they dont, you still get 5%. if they do, you get a nice discount

[22-Jul-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
such a money making method has never been possible before (other than for exchange owners)

Do Alts start pump when the dominance starts to tank or when it reaches a certain lvl?

[22-Jul-19 08:30 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Andersen

[22-Jul-19 08:40 PM] richardt#2807
If I remember correctly, during the last alt season BTC dominance went down to almost 30%.  I may be a bit off though

[22-Jul-19 08:45 PM] JimD#9272
BTC will cap out and instead of cashing out people will dump money into alts as speculative investments

[22-Jul-19 08:45 PM] JimD#9272
Last time Etherium and their ICOs drove it, not sure what will be the catalyst this time

[22-Jul-19 08:45 PM] JimD#9272
1400$ ETH....loool

[22-Jul-19 08:47 PM] JimD#9272
Also the BTC network was shit during that time

[22-Jul-19 08:48 PM] richardt#2807
Although the market sentiment does seem different this time around though.  People are more weary of alts now

[22-Jul-19 08:48 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, Im not sure what will trigger.  The BTC network will probably still be clogged in a bull market which will drive some traffic to alternatives

[22-Jul-19 08:48 PM] JimD#9272
those fees and transaction times were outrageous for a while

[22-Jul-19 08:51 PM] richardt#2807
Also doesn't help that there seems to be a lot of people just waiting to break even/cut losses.  Would likely need a flood of newcomers to see an altseason like the previous one

[22-Jul-19 08:52 PM] richardt#2807
Unless people finally break away from shitcoins and put money into real projects.  But that would just be wishful thinking

[22-Jul-19 08:53 PM] JimD#9272
I think most people are riding their shitcoins to zero

[22-Jul-19 08:53 PM] JimD#9272
I know I have a few that Im not gonna sell

[22-Jul-19 08:54 PM] JimD#9272
would rather go down with the ship than admit Im an idiot

[22-Jul-19 08:54 PM] JimD#9272
which makes me a bigger idiot

[22-Jul-19 08:54 PM] JimD#9272
but muh dick

[22-Jul-19 09:01 PM] richardt#2807
Being patient and riding it out is usually the best strategy.  So long as you're holding the right coins
