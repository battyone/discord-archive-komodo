I'm happy to finally purchase a bitcoin worth of KMD and not have the price go up 5%.

[06-May-19 04:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There fixed my order. 
@Kitchen Table - I can respect that.  I originally chose not to purchase dragon chain because of the name, but I looked into it anyway, and I'm glad I didn't.  

You might feel differently with Pirate üòÉ

It's just my personal preference, nothing against the coin and what it does. With major exchanges teetering on regulation and proving they don't laundry money the idea of them listing a coin called "Pirate" might not help with either. I have been wrong many times so I do not mind if I am wrong now as well.

[06-May-19 04:55 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah I'm watching him closely

@Deleted User I can agree with that. Don't like using the central exchanges either. Straight up scares me at times.

[06-May-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the questions isnt whether the central exchanges like the name PIRATE, it is whether people do

i know absolutely nothing about Pirate

[06-May-19 05:19 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
id appreciate if someone could tell me what it is, where/why to buy

[06-May-19 05:19 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
etc.

[06-May-19 05:19 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
whats its purpose and advantages

[06-May-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
zcash has this problem: https://cryptolux.org/images/d/d9/Zcash.pdf

[06-May-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is the solution

[06-May-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
total privacy

[06-May-19 05:31 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so if a wallet ID is hidden, does that mean you can't see transactions on the ledger?\

[06-May-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
all that can be seen is a txid, that says that someone sent some amount to somebody

[06-May-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
without any other details

[06-May-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
like this: http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/543455eb9e52a0ffb57ddbbb149edf2dfd5fe67d4eeddeb0c4451c546f18f35b

[06-May-19 05:37 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
aah

[06-May-19 05:37 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and so the issue with zcash is that these transactions can be traced from a private address to a public one, thus  deanonymizing the users?

[06-May-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem with zcash is only about 15% of tx are shielded, so the rest are fully transparent, which has 2 effects

[06-May-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
1) no privacy at all for 85%

[06-May-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
2) privacy for the 15% is mostly lost

[06-May-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this is because most of the private tx are miners shielding coinbase (this is a requirement for zcash) and then immediately convert to transparent to deposit and sell to exchange

[06-May-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
optional privacy ends up being no privacy at all

[06-May-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
with PIRATE it is 100% privacy for user tx, and there is no option, so users cant even mess up their privacy short of posting "hey i just did a txid for 400 PIRATE"

[06-May-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
with a mixed taddr/zaddr setup it is very easy to lose all the privacy by sending some funds to an address that is correlated externally

[06-May-19 05:40 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[06-May-19 05:40 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

my experience so far is that pirate isn't particularly accessible, such as setting up agama in the correct mode, adding the chain or whatever. I know it goes with the territory but e.g. monero mobile apps actually work well and are reasonably user friendly

Hacker Tries to Ransom Github Code Repositories For Bitcoin
The attack started only about day ago and has also been hitting code repositories on similar services Bitbucket and GitLab. To break in, the hacker appears to be targeting accounts with weak passwords. But it remains unclear if anything of value was taken.

QT is compiled C/C++ code vs JS for agama

I'm not criticizing anyone, just saying the wallet experience leaves some to be desired compared to the 2019 state of the art for some projects. Yeah ZCash still doesn't have a mobile or lite wallet that supports shielded.

[06-May-19 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im just stating that for a project that has less than a year it seems a bit unfair to want it to have the same state of the art wallets as a coin that have 5 years of existance.

[06-May-19 07:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Especially when that coin you are comparing it to existed for more than 3 years without any GUI what so ever.

best way to make these statements is to help and participate in the community to get things moving forward. The same way Monero achieved their development.

Tbh @Malti was sending some xmr earlier today and was complaining he was afraid to close the wallet as it froze as he was sending funds... not all sunshine and rainbows in xmr land either. Not to say monero isnt a good coin, just saying it can happen to any coin üòÉ

@siu - Chainmakers XMR was one of the first coins to have a lite wallet, https://wallet.mymonero.com/

[06-May-19 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
has existed since at least 2016, so... " for more than 3 years before having its first GUI wallet" is quite a stretch

[06-May-19 08:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is a web wallet.
