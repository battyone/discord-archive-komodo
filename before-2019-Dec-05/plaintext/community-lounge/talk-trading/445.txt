[27-Feb-19 11:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Volume this week is lacking compared to the weeks before. We might still be in a range for some time.

[27-Feb-19 11:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
pretty good string of recent accomplishments, maybe working, original tech is worth something all of a sudden? probably not

[27-Feb-19 11:19 AM] BlockTech#6895
price is around 28k now, but on DigitalPrice there is still 2'000KMD to sell under 26,6k sat.

[27-Feb-19 12:23 PM] Likewise#6767

Also, we consolidated in a 14% range for 9-10 days and the horizontal that kept us down was broken above of so short term I think we will keep going up

[27-Feb-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810

[27-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Tek#5253
not sure what else it could be

[27-Feb-19 12:44 PM] Tek#5253
maybe he was trying to get people to dump in this range and the market sell was just to scare people

[27-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Tek#5253
he probably sold to his other account(s) a lot

[27-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Tek#5253
