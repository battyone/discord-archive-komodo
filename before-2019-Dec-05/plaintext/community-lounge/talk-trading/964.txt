Money, it cost to hire someone that knows how to clone a coin and setup a new chain.

The industry nowadays is sort of making it even more complicated

Do you guys know that in cosmos, they are trying to create a futures market for the mined cosmos to gain liquidity?

[24-Jul-19 01:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How is cosmos mined?

Cosmos uses Tendermint that is a kind of PoS but only the top 100 holders stake, maybe if you buy enough Atoms you can enter in the 100

@siu - Chainmakers is the issue of not receiving the funds solved?

[24-Jul-19 01:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[24-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Oszy#5734
so do i need to update to receive what was missing?

[24-Jul-19 01:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[24-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So they’re trying to curb the volatility of cost of production (virtually zero from what I can see) for cosmos

[24-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Makes sense

Anyone have an idea what these guys are building on?

[24-Jul-19 02:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sounds a lot like atomicdex tbh

[24-Jul-19 03:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
too few details, seems they provide a secure engine for trading on CEX without connecting to CEX. Like a decentralized Changelly.io

[24-Jul-19 03:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
interesting but not like atomicdex

Easiest way to buy crypto , adopted and fuck cheap fees

[24-Jul-19 06:48 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I don't get the hate

[24-Jul-19 06:48 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's highly regarded by literally everyone in the space

[24-Jul-19 06:48 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Tek sup dash bro

[24-Jul-19 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont really like the masternode setup but to each his own I guess

[24-Jul-19 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Privacy wise its ok

[24-Jul-19 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Adoption pretty great

[24-Jul-19 06:49 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes I dobt even think about the masternode stuff just the easyness to buy crypto

[24-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Low fees etc is only an issue compared to btc

[24-Jul-19 06:50 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Go in Walmart buy voucher redeem in 3 min

[24-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
@mrtzmp3 people who don't like dash have never used crypto currency

[24-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
its simple as that

[24-Jul-19 06:50 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yeah

[24-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have used crypto

[24-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A lot

[24-Jul-19 06:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's surely one of the alts to survive

[24-Jul-19 06:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure why making asssumptions like that would make a good arguement but ok

[24-Jul-19 06:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
When pirate prepaid cards

[24-Jul-19 06:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Cryptoon

[24-Jul-19 06:51 PM] Tek#5253

[24-Jul-19 06:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I hope for pirate one day

[24-Jul-19 06:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I like also pirate

[24-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
i traded my btc for dash bch and kmd today

[24-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If pirate gets prepaid cards in the following 10 years you pay me 10000 btc vs my 1 btc @Tek

[24-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
> 10 years

[24-Jul-19 06:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Wow dash got rekt btx ratio

[24-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As *never* is a pretty strong assumption

[24-Jul-19 06:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Easy bet then for you

[24-Jul-19 06:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Easy btc earned 😃

[24-Jul-19 06:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For a big baller like you probably not an issue to pay me 10k btc in the event it should happen anyway

[24-Jul-19 06:53 PM] Tek#5253
dash is feeding the poor

[24-Jul-19 06:53 PM] Tek#5253

[24-Jul-19 06:55 PM] Tek#5253

[24-Jul-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Pretty sure you can spend kmd anywhere that uses coinpaymznrs

Kmd will have also prepaid options

[24-Jul-19 06:56 PM] Tek#5253
kmd isn't spendable anywhere compared to the reach dash has

[24-Jul-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also through pungo you can get a kmd mastercard to spend your kmd

[24-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anywhere

[24-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Tek#5253
