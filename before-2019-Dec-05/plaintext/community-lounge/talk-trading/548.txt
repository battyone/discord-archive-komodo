[15-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Tek#5253

KMD is hashpower's bitch

[15-Apr-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are using one thing, but can change to another without anybodys permission, then what is the relationship?

[15-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Tek#5253
the complete KMD history is stored in a BTC block , or just some hashes?

[15-Apr-19 02:12 PM] Tek#5253
or do you need all the BTC blocks that kmd ever wrote to have the history

[15-Apr-19 02:12 PM] Tek#5253
I'm not really sure the inner workings of KMD

[15-Apr-19 02:13 PM] Tek#5253
so what happens if btc gets pwned, the kmd blocks are gone

[15-Apr-19 02:13 PM] Tek#5253
notary network has a backup?

[15-Apr-19 02:13 PM] allbits#5898
"I'm not really sure the inner workings of KMD" - but you'll irresponsibly repeat derogatory memes over and over again

[15-Apr-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if BTC magically disappears, KMD is still around

[15-Apr-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and switches to the highest hash rate coin to notarize to

[15-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Tek#5253
but aren't you missing the history you stored in BTC

[15-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Tek#5253
or is that not how it works

[15-Apr-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the history is also in the KMD chain

[15-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Tek#5253
ok makes sense

it is ok to call BTC our hashrate module

[15-Apr-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
like zcash is our privacy module

[15-Apr-19 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I forgot to mention earlier... basically having the opportunity to run a Notary Node actually costs about $1.5 to $2 million right now.

[15-Apr-19 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its just that its not your own money

[15-Apr-19 02:31 PM] dokrates#8987

tanking on the news

[15-Apr-19 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but you still need people that hold the equivalent of  that kind money to vote for you.

[15-Apr-19 02:32 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Apr-19 02:32 PM] dokrates#8987
bchsv dumping hard

[15-Apr-19 02:32 PM] Tek#5253
extremely hard

[15-Apr-19 02:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, im not saying you are spending them from your wallets

[15-Apr-19 02:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but the same quantity of money needs to be held by the community to get you a place.

[15-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Tek#5253
a dash masternode is cheaper

[15-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Tek#5253
rite now

[15-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Tek#5253
than a kmd node

[15-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Tek#5253
: D

[15-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Tek#5253
didn't he say $1.2mil

BSV moves to BCH

[15-Apr-19 02:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if you are able to vote yourself in a notary node, you should be able to buy yourself a master node

[15-Apr-19 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_starts slowly buying 2M KMD so that next year he doesn't have to run and can just vote himself in_

[15-Apr-19 02:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
actually a master node would be a better investment since there is noelections

[15-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Tek#5253
I think both will do great

[15-Apr-19 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not saying its best for the network, im just looking at the costs and investments part

[15-Apr-19 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
obviously KMD is a better system because you are held accountable in a way for not being a good notary

[15-Apr-19 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] dokrates#8987

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] dokrates#8987

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] dokrates#8987
im not calling for a pump, but at least holding the price

[15-Apr-19 02:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its holding $1 pretty well

[15-Apr-19 02:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Unfortunatley all markets have bots that trade to fiat value

[15-Apr-19 02:45 PM] dokrates#8987
i hope it hold 1$

[15-Apr-19 02:45 PM] dokrates#8987
otherwise i'll be fucked

[15-Apr-19 02:46 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Only if you sell.

[15-Apr-19 02:46 PM] dokrates#8987
yes, that's true

[15-Apr-19 02:46 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
if you are confindent about what you think kmd can do then these price swings should be opprotunitys for you üòÉ

[15-Apr-19 02:46 PM] dokrates#8987
i just hold 85% of my holdings in kmd

[15-Apr-19 02:47 PM] dokrates#8987
tried to rebuy the 15% i used for trading

[15-Apr-19 02:47 PM] dokrates#8987

i know it sucks when prices go down but we all know what we are getting into.

[15-Apr-19 02:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is not very bad.

[15-Apr-19 02:47 PM] dokrates#8987
for me it's very frustrating

[15-Apr-19 02:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if that is the case, you are over exposed.

[15-Apr-19 02:48 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
depends on what your hoping to achieve with that bag? is it cold store bag or a flipping bag?

[15-Apr-19 02:48 PM] dokrates#8987
i just sold 15% around 30k

[15-Apr-19 02:48 PM] dokrates#8987
wanted to rebuy, and waiting for 2-3 weeks

[15-Apr-19 02:48 PM] dokrates#8987
and when i thought it bounce at 20k, i bought at 22k

[15-Apr-19 02:48 PM] dokrates#8987
and failed

[15-Apr-19 02:48 PM] dokrates#8987
XD

[15-Apr-19 02:49 PM] dokrates#8987
anyway i always learn from mistakes

[15-Apr-19 02:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
22k is a good entry for kmd - You will be very lucky to see around 13k again tbh 22k is good entry
