[08-May-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326

[08-May-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe other traders have more history on the name "whalebro"

[08-May-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Hollowman9000 didn't you make an amazing memepic of whalebro a long time ago?

[08-May-19 01:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, but nobody knows who it is, since obviously his trading KMD are on the exchanges

[08-May-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
whalebro could be a whalelady, you don't know her

[08-May-19 01:39 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
the guy w the most kmd has 8.5M dollars worth

[08-May-19 01:39 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
is that jl777

[08-May-19 01:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@dukeleto seriously , how probable is that :)

[08-May-19 01:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Somewhere mid/end 2018 a new big address popped up

[08-May-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the same time someone on binance started accumulating huge amounts of kmd

[08-May-19 01:42 PM] klein#5233
richlist still says supernet?

[08-May-19 01:42 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
dont people like that end up pump and dumping KMD

[08-May-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought supernet held 7,x million kmd

[08-May-19 01:43 PM] klein#5233
yeah 7 not 8.5

[08-May-19 01:43 PM] klein#5233
old news

[08-May-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah k, so top hodler is now supernet after jl sold the last part of waves superNET held

[08-May-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
before MWQV was top hodler, which some believe is whalebro

[08-May-19 01:43 PM] Malti#3948
whalebro is whalebro

[08-May-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But could also just be binance cold wallet

[08-May-19 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Fact is that there is someone accumulating huge amounts of kmd for a year or so

[08-May-19 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
often placing 50-200BTC buywalls for kmd

[08-May-19 01:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just saw vote2019 took a huge jump in % voted

[08-May-19 01:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
from 10% ish before the weekend to over 22% votes now

[08-May-19 01:46 PM] Malti#3948
could be whalebro that voted

[08-May-19 01:46 PM] Malti#3948
whalesis

[08-May-19 01:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
¬¥And cz praised kmd in his article ?¬¥
obviously I missed that - would that mean they are looking into using KMD tech for their DEX?
do you have a quote?

whalebro still holds all votes üòÉ

[08-May-19 01:48 PM] Malti#3948
CZ once tweeted that he believes coins will not be the future, but more ecosystem creators such as KMD

[08-May-19 01:48 PM] Malti#3948
or something in the lines of that, can't find the tweet

[08-May-19 01:48 PM] Malti#3948
maybe @Cryptoon  you retweeted it

Most top 10 addresses still have the same # of votes as they had in the beginning

[08-May-19 01:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
well, actually all of them it seems

[08-May-19 01:50 PM] Malti#3948
CZ cited newer tools like Komodo and Tendermint that make it possible to write blockchains for specific purposes, suggesting the future will consist of numerous bespoke ledgers. His comment‚Äîand this is just my interpretation‚Äîimplies that blockchains will evolve in the way of chips, where customized ASIC (‚Äúapplication specific integrated circuit‚Äù) chips have come to dominate computing over general purpose ones.

Anyone know how many of the top adresses actually voted last year?

[08-May-19 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Top 10 adresses still hold like 20million votes

[08-May-19 01:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
most of them exchange cold/hot wallets though

[08-May-19 01:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362

I agree that @binance should not even consider the re-org but let's not rule everything out:

For example: Re-org to all time high seems like it's worth pursuing. 

Please RT so enough miners can see, agree, and @justinsuntron donates.

kmd pumping on

[08-May-19 02:07 PM] Tek#5253
this is it isn't it brehs

[08-May-19 02:09 PM] Tek#5253
when kmd is above 22k sats it will be my biggest holding

[08-May-19 02:09 PM] Tek#5253
percentage wise

[08-May-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
anything below 50k sats and KMD is my biggest üòõ

[08-May-19 02:10 PM] Tek#5253
Maybe I should double my target

[08-May-19 02:10 PM] Tek#5253
I accumulated my target stash of KMD

[08-May-19 02:11 PM] Tek#5253
but maybe Ishould just buy even more

[08-May-19 02:14 PM] Malti#3948
i've been accumulating a while now and now I'm actually spending quite some of it on ARRR. It hurts to see my KMD holdings go down, but on the other hand I also want more arrr

[08-May-19 02:14 PM] Malti#3948
it's always a difficult situation

[08-May-19 02:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
50k kmd volume via ARRR on DP.

[08-May-19 02:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
tough call on which to to choose

[08-May-19 02:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ARRR% of my portfolio more than doubled the past month or so because of it mooning so hard

feelsgoodman

[08-May-19 02:17 PM] Malti#3948
arrr is a pretty long shot, but since its a KMD ecosystem coin , I believe odds are good

[08-May-19 02:53 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
why invest in  ARRR over KMD? Won't any surge in ARRR price also lead to a proportional surge in KMD price?  With KMD, you reap the benefits of surges in ARRR, in addition to all the other features and coins on the ecosystem

[08-May-19 02:53 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
assuming that surges are from outside the ecosystem, not current KMD holders converting their KMD into ARRR

[08-May-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Both are independent from each other so I dont see why it would lead to proportional surges if either price increases?

[08-May-19 02:58 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
well if ARRR surges that means more people are using and buying coins on the Komodo Platform

[08-May-19 02:58 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
wouldnt that boost KMD prices?

[08-May-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`why invest in ARRR over KMD? `
Because some people like to invest in privacy?

[08-May-19 02:59 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
but a lot of people are just buying at as a money-maker investment, not to actually utilize its private framework

[08-May-19 02:59 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
utility wise it is definitely important

[08-May-19 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
as long as those people create transactions (even just to move to another exchange), the "unwittingly" invest in privacy no matter what their intent is and they make it better for the rest of us
