Ten days ago, when I said that Craig and Calvin's true target was the BTC network, that was met with the same incredulity as when I very vocally warned, in June, that they desired to split the BCH chain.

i wouldnt be lying if i said i have no fcking clue what all these dudes are on about lol

[15-Nov-18 01:51 PM] jorian#4555
it's so weird

[15-Nov-18 01:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i have to admit im not upto date with it because is just ignore bch things lol

[15-Nov-18 01:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's more hot air from CSW

[15-Nov-18 01:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but we know that if he wins BCH, what the next targets are

[15-Nov-18 01:55 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
so csw is trying to fork bch? and then you think he will come for btc?

[15-Nov-18 01:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think CSW is sniffing coke with his paper wallets

[15-Nov-18 01:56 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
cant we dpow btc onto verus or something :trollface:

[15-Nov-18 01:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
no,  BCH is forking without replay protection between ABC and SV. One of them will fold and die or ABC will change algo, there's no way the 2 forks will cohexist.

[15-Nov-18 01:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
The next target are all other pow Alts

[15-Nov-18 01:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
attacking and mining empty blocks to disrupt their operations

[15-Nov-18 01:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
then Bitcoin is the final boss

[15-Nov-18 01:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
oh ok i get you.

[15-Nov-18 01:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
maybe this will expose a flaw in PoW game theory

[15-Nov-18 01:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
and we'll all change to PoS or other alternative

but he wnt be a crazy billionaire anymore...

[15-Nov-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW will make the attack require 95%+ hashrates

[15-Nov-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
seems his eventual target is to spend the segwit anyone can spend utxos

[15-Nov-18 02:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
is is possible to dpow btc to say verus?

[15-Nov-18 02:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
verus because 50 50 pow pos and dpow

[15-Nov-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i took 4 years for BTC core to not increase blocksize in a sane way

[15-Nov-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i just dont see them accepting external ideas

[15-Nov-18 02:02 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah it would take a long time for someone to say ok.

[15-Nov-18 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they wont as long as btc has the most hashrate

[15-Nov-18 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if it is overtaken one day, im sure they will start hearing outside ideas.

[15-Nov-18 02:27 PM] dokrates#8987
guys, do you think its a good moment to buy komodo at 17000 sat?

[15-Nov-18 02:28 PM] dokrates#8987
that buy wall gives me some good vibe

[15-Nov-18 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
never buy taking a wall into account

[15-Nov-18 02:32 PM] yorklab#7270
Impossible to time the market. I think it comes down to how much you believe in the project. Long term it should do well.

Over the years, I've developed a good sense for the "Craig touch." He brings the IQ down of any group he is in. That's why there isn't a single smart person behind BSV, the CoinGeek coin. That's why the attacks are going to be super dumb.

what if you were to take a gamble and buy 5 mins prior to fork?

[15-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and that this is sell the rumour / buy the news?

[15-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
instead of buy the rumour sell the news

On one side, we have a self-proclaimed gambling-rich guy, on the other, we have a collection of people and companies that want to build a new currency. Of these, Bitmain's balance sheet had been made public, and they have very, very deep pockets.

Good point

[15-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
when does fork actually happen?

[15-Nov-18 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
Or well when do their consensus rules diverge? might not fork immediately after that

[15-Nov-18 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
will fork when they disagree

yeah and if you talk to people nobody wanted him as prez

[15-Nov-18 04:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but I believe a lot of people voted for him as a vote AGAINST the establishment
