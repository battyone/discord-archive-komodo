another week another kmd dump

[05-Aug-19 10:41 AM] Tek#5253
I officially gave up frens.

[05-Aug-19 10:41 AM] Tek#5253
I stop buying now

[05-Aug-19 10:46 AM] umitkara48#6464
I never buy

[05-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Tek#5253
i've given up

[05-Aug-19 10:57 AM] Tek#5253
according to my research itcan only drop a max of 50% more on the BTC markets when I capitulate

[05-Aug-19 10:57 AM] Tek#5253
so I guess the bottom is 4500 satoshi

[05-Aug-19 10:57 AM] Tek#5253
i hope this hold will be worth it

[05-Aug-19 10:59 AM] Markus#5464
Litecoin and Eth got a boost

[05-Aug-19 10:59 AM] Markus#5464
maybe some alt rally about to start up

[05-Aug-19 11:00 AM] Thievery#4576
ETH is still down with BTC

[05-Aug-19 11:03 AM] Lanii#8302
If there is interest I can share a "simple" technique on how to scout for buys without trying to catch knifes/bottoms

[05-Aug-19 11:03 AM] Lanii#8302
Unless your deep knees already ^^

[05-Aug-19 11:03 AM] phm87#7395

[05-Aug-19 11:22 AM] Caglio#3337
kmd might get back some cash value

Dont see us going below this 1 year support

[05-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Caglio#3337
hehe well our bottom few days ago was 9.2?

[05-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Caglio#3337
I told you how I feel about those bottoms

[05-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Caglio#3337
they are bottom, until suddenly they arent anymore

[05-Aug-19 12:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Masterful observations @Caglio

[05-Aug-19 12:03 PM] Caglio#3337
Yup ( : bottom of out coin is 0

[05-Aug-19 12:03 PM] Caglio#3337
When it hits the bottom we will say goodbye to each other here and leave the discord

[05-Aug-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So what you are saying we may or may have bottomed and we may or may not go up or down or sideways?

[05-Aug-19 12:03 PM] Caglio#3337
Ihope it wont hit it tho, but once again, I am sure time of obtaining btc with kmd are gone

[05-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Yes, I just dont draw fancy charts that actually fucked up people

[05-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Caglio#3337
so many charts on crypto twitter

[05-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Caglio#3337
sometimes true, most of times bullshit

[05-Aug-19 12:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They may or may not come true üòÑ

[05-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Caglio#3337
but even a broken clock hits time twice per day

[05-Aug-19 12:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If you say it goes up, you have a 50% chance it does, or just wait till time proves you right

[05-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
Exactly

[05-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
I remember first time when I wanted to assault someone

[05-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
someone online I mean

[05-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
It was a chick named litecoin queen, she had like 40000 followers

[05-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Caglio#3337
Probably only cos she was a chick, and internet is full of horny males that are either virgins, or they lost virginity in a shed to uncle Robert

[05-Aug-19 12:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
lol

[05-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, she was one of the biggest (HODL,HODL) retards

[05-Aug-19 12:07 PM] Caglio#3337
She was with ltc all the way from 40$ to 350$ if I remember correctly

[05-Aug-19 12:07 PM] Caglio#3337
Shilling ltc like she knows everything

[05-Aug-19 12:07 PM] Caglio#3337
She drew those charts without even knowing what she is doing

[05-Aug-19 12:07 PM] Caglio#3337
She would always be bullish, but calling for some kind of "correction"

[05-Aug-19 12:07 PM] Caglio#3337
A lot of her posts were

[05-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Caglio#3337
we are going up, unless we go down to this, but there is a chance we stay sideways

[05-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Caglio#3337
And people were actually approving her sherlock holmes deduction skills

[05-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Ofc, when coin went down from 350 to 50

[05-Aug-19 12:08 PM] Caglio#3337

lol

[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] Caglio#3337
If it comes back to 250 I am sure she will reaper

[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] Caglio#3337
Worst thing of all, people actually donated her some ltc

[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] Caglio#3337
For charts that were saying HODL HODL

[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] Caglio#3337
I think she lost so much money to sheeps

[05-Aug-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
