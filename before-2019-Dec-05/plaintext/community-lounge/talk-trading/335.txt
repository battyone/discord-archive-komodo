ETH pump! its up 2%

[07-Dec-18 03:32 PM] snowdamn#2414
yup

[07-Dec-18 03:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
not a magician to pick perfect time, but many will make a lot of dough with this play
i've already decided i'm letting it ride if i don't get liquidated
it will be the bottom of all bottoms if BTC doesn't die

impossible to pick absolute bottom

[07-Dec-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
looks like after this bottom, will retest one more time

[07-Dec-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this much sell pressure will take a while to process

[07-Dec-18 03:39 PM] snowdamn#2414
yeah, that's when liquidation is highly likely the way things went
but also why i'll make more than 2x if they don't kick me lol

[07-Dec-18 03:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
if i get kicked, i'll find comfort in the fact that at least i'm not stupid enough to add to the position...

[07-Dec-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
ETH went as low as 82.5?!

[07-Dec-18 03:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
$80.xx

[07-Dec-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810

well it will take a long time for the market to build a base it can rise from

[07-Dec-18 03:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
sad to say, but crypto market is not looking very healthy 
it's all about what BTC does or not do
we're in for a long wait for any significant change

hi everybody

[07-Dec-18 03:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
hi

[07-Dec-18 03:49 PM] DrKush#8774
@snowdamn a good correction of the market cleans up! but if the market continued to rise like in 2017 it would have been very dangerous for the new actors of the crypto-world

[07-Dec-18 03:50 PM] snowdamn#2414
agree, pump was ridiculous

[07-Dec-18 03:52 PM] DrKush#8774
it is the risk of having no institution, state, or body guarantor of the currency;)

Hyperledger is castrated blockchains for all, ETH will have a hard time because of it

[07-Dec-18 04:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Kmd i think will need to distinguish from that abd stand out
