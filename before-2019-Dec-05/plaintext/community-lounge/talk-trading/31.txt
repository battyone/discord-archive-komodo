@Deleted User I have never heard of a fine for not locking your car, sounds like bullshit.

[28-Jun-18 11:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You‚Äôre enticing criminals you see

I‚Äôm more than happy to talk about bitmain sucking though

[28-Jun-18 11:58 AM] ch6ris#5240
Can't help you with that one. Most of the centrilzed bitcoin rrlated services have pissed me off one way or the other.

[28-Jun-18 11:59 AM] ch6ris#5240

[28-Jun-18 12:06 PM] Lumbi#8378

[28-Jun-18 12:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve seen signs like that stop bad guys in their tracks

[28-Jun-18 12:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúOh fuck, we can‚Äôt have guns here, the robbery is off, let‚Äôs go home‚Äù

[28-Jun-18 12:07 PM] ch6ris#5240
I'd imagine sketchy junkies would freak out.

[28-Jun-18 12:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I chuckle every time now

[28-Jun-18 12:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[28-Jun-18 01:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I want to buy an antminer from you

[28-Jun-18 01:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[28-Jun-18 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doubt he‚Äôll respond because it‚Äôs probably not one of his bags

[28-Jun-18 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But gotta do it

[28-Jun-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You want me to resell a device that I just got **yesterday**? $9k USD

[28-Jun-18 02:05 PM] Bittersweet#9376
@Hollowman9000 problem is barterdex has no fiat gateway outside of centralized exchanges obviously

[28-Jun-18 02:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do the trex‚Äôs, polo‚Äôs, and hitbtc‚Äôs of the world have fiat gateways

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I only ever used coinbase

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
trex just started one

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$9k is a bit steep

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
polo bought by circle should have one

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"$9k is a bit steep"
Not when you figure that you're asking me to give up the earnings from it

[28-Jun-18 02:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
True

[28-Jun-18 02:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe I‚Äôll try a different email

[28-Jun-18 02:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe they‚Äôre auto-trashed by my current service

[28-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Decentralize localbitcoins

[28-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Make it on kmd

[28-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
LocalDEX

[28-Jun-18 02:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
just bring a friend, a pistol, and a counterfeit tester marker

[28-Jun-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[28-Jun-18 02:28 PM] Jazzy#0001
I think a decentralized localbitcoins was the hodlhodl pitch but I don't think they're as decentralized as they say they are

[28-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie

[28-Jun-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[28-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or did you just give bitmain your ssn

[28-Jun-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I never give anyone my ssn

[28-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Trying to sort through their order page

[28-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

All I have in the boxes are EIN as Tax ID and EIN

[28-Jun-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the other stuff in the bottom 1/2 is blank

[28-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah so you have a business set up for it?

[28-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Might be the way to go

[28-Jun-18 02:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Over $2500 in declared value, will have to be formally cleared

[28-Jun-18 02:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What a pain in the dick

[28-Jun-18 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[28-Jun-18 02:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe that‚Äôs why most don‚Äôt bother with all this shit

[28-Jun-18 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"formally cleared" is a euphemism for "this is the part where we charge $30k per container for 2 people to sign a slip saying it transferred hands"

[28-Jun-18 02:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Did you have any issues that needed mediation by a third party, or were they just delivered directly to you?

[28-Jun-18 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there's literally a line painted on the dock; anything on the inbound side of that line has been "formally cleared"

[28-Jun-18 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I have all mine shipped directly to our office

[28-Jun-18 02:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah, uh, m..me too

[28-Jun-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
