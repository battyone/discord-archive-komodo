Well, you got a country full of people who genuinely thought socialism was going to work and kept voting for more and more government. Not sure if that is fixable in the short/medium run.

[27-May-19 04:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
What you have is a country suffering from the resource curse. i.e. they have oil and there are people who want to take it at any cost.

[27-May-19 04:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
Libya had free college and healthcare for all up until it was bombed into the stone age for oil

[27-May-19 04:55 PM] actionslacks#4072

in trading related news... I guess being up 10% on 10+mil volume is no big deal again

Seems optimistic.  These are people who dont want to be responsible for their own healthcare, for their own retirement, they dont want to be responsible for setting prices of goods, they dont want to be responsible for self defense, etc.  They don't want freedom.  So they definitely don't want to be their own banks.

Venezuelans got EXACTLY what they have been voting/asking for for years.

the guns are the most important.  They protect all the other things

violence is the only language governments understand.  So citizens need to be fluent in that language

The question is if you can get it registered to your name easily tbh

[27-May-19 07:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
probably like 3k and then another 10k to bribe the right persons to make sure it is registered to your name

[27-May-19 07:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
apart from the broker, dont you need some govt officials and notaries to make sure it's official?

[27-May-19 07:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the official ones no

[27-May-19 07:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but I assume there is a lot of corruption

[27-May-19 07:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
especially if someone is coming to buy shit with dollars or whatever

[27-May-19 07:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
