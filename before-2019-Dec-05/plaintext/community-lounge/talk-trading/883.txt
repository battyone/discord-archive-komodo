8 days...

[01-Jul-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or maybe 9

[01-Jul-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Markus you are in charge of the countdown

[01-Jul-19 08:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It seems like BTC wants to do a similar move like what it did in the 6k - 8k range

lower timeframes look good, as if it is near a bottom

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, better strap in

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Seems perfect storm

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc 20k, kmd 60k

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
;p

[01-Jul-19 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Daily starts to paint a possible bottom too. Bouncing off the 20sma and RSI might be bouncing in the 50 range which is on par with bull market.

Last week's candle drew a shooting star and closed back below weekly bb

[01-Jul-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Weekly needs to bounce at 9k ish to be bullish again?

[01-Jul-19 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and it still looks like the first line of defense which is the 8ema is still quite below 10k

[01-Jul-19 08:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
weekly needs to go again above weekly bb to be bullish

[01-Jul-19 08:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but that is not easy to do.

[01-Jul-19 08:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and monthly gets even uglyer

8ema and 20sma on weekly are still well below 8k

[01-Jul-19 08:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its the problem with moving averages, they always look ugly after a big pump :p

not much marketing today i guess...

[02-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Alecandro#1179
How can the Komodo team market when bitcoin is going to 0!?!?! It‚Äôs not their fault

[02-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Alecandro#1179
Tomorrow we‚Äôll be shooting for $1M though so it‚Äôs okay

[02-Jul-19 02:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
btc has gotta hit 10k before the bull can resume.

@dukeleto

[02-Jul-19 09:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Here is the maths challenge.

[02-Jul-19 09:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If we start on Dec 21st with KMD at 76k sats and you held 10k KMD, if you had 1 BTC, how much would you need to long to retain the same amount of KMD but also make back the same amount of BTC lost during the bear market factoring open interest üòõ

[02-Jul-19 09:04 AM] Malti#3948
@Cryptoon is also not retarded when it comes to numbers

[02-Jul-19 09:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Easy answer would be 7.6BTC on that day, current price = 1.3BTC so needed to make 6.3BTC

[02-Jul-19 09:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Actually maybe my question does not work, you couldnt have longed and made money üòõ

[02-Jul-19 09:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The reason for this exercise is to figure out if there is a optimal strategy of using BTC longs to offset losses incurred during BTC bull runs where alts get killed

[02-Jul-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
this is not a maths problem, more a trading strategy issue

[02-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you couldnt have longed kmd/btc to gain more btc as kmd/btc is at atl

[02-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd/usd to gain more btc yes, but that is not taking into account the btc/usd gain you had in the same period

[02-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd/usd gained less %wise than btc/usd

[02-Jul-19 09:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c you are right

[02-Jul-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need extensive modeling, pattern recognition, backtesting, etc.

[02-Jul-19 09:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Cryptoon maybe we can start from the BTC low

[02-Jul-19 09:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so opportunity cost to invest in kmd/usd bottom instead of btc/usd bottom

[02-Jul-19 09:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What if you longed BTC to offset the alt losses to BTC?

[02-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
just sell when things are at ATH and buy when at ATL

[02-Jul-19 09:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
üòÑ

[02-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that crypto is still so new, each cycle is different than the previous

[02-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
a BTC bull/bear cycle when there are 10 alts vs 1000 vs 10000 + facebook + ...

[02-Jul-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so you would need to be able to predict how today market will unfold, when it has never been this way before

[02-Jul-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
much easier to just cost average buy during bear market and sell only when you need funds

[02-Jul-19 09:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sound advice, lessen for next bull market, keep dry powder üòÑ

[02-Jul-19 09:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[02-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jorian#4555
who here has a cash-out plan?

[02-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jorian#4555
for the coming / ongoing bull?

[02-Jul-19 09:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
im sure we will forget and keep waiting üòõ

[02-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jorian#4555
exactly üòõ

[02-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
cost average out when things are over bought

[02-Jul-19 09:16 AM] jorian#4555
in any other market, from 3200 to 13000 in 3 months would be an overbought scenario, but i'm not selling

[02-Jul-19 09:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But i do have a plan this time around and will do what James has suggested

[02-Jul-19 09:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont have btc so that is not a problem üòÉ

[02-Jul-19 09:16 AM] jorian#4555
i averaged into alts way too soon

[02-Jul-19 09:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I never left üòÉ

[02-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jorian#4555
people are saying alt season will not start until BTC hits 20k. ü§∑

[02-Jul-19 09:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would you sell btc at 20k though?

[02-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jorian#4555
by then it would feel the party just started

[02-Jul-19 09:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Exactly üòÑ

[02-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be a very volatile path to the higher prices

[02-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
very easy to get whipsawed

[02-Jul-19 09:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
My prediction : 1.5 more years of 10-15k range

[02-Jul-19 09:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am fine with that, means alts will have mooned

‚ÄôWhat if you longed BTC to offset the alt losses to BTC?‚Äô

[02-Jul-19 09:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Then you would need to margin trade btc in order to gain more btc when btc goes up

[02-Jul-19 09:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think Komodo will be fine,  too many good things coming,  perseverance pays off eventually and now we ( and other ecosystem projects )are starting to get mentions from high profile entities.

[02-Jul-19 09:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
otherwise when you go 1x long you just have your btc gains in usd, but not extra gains in btc to offset btc losses in alts

@Cryptoon yes need to work out how many x and factor interest etc

[02-Jul-19 09:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think you should be able to do so in a spreadsheet pretty easily

[02-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
heard about v systems and of course sunny king is well known

[02-Jul-19 09:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
butttt, trading with margins is very risky, model needs to be rocksolid to work let alone give some indication of what to do
