@tolken What about China? KMD hasn't penetrated the asian markets.

‚ÄúAll of the value of issuance comes from holders‚Äù - zooko

[23-Aug-19 02:51 AM] tolken#2655
@PTYX just fuckin with ya, I thought that wwould be obvious when two words were promised, but only one delivered. Seriously though, Redfox and followers keep teasing about China via twitter, no idea what they‚Äôre talking about.

Dear whale, youre doing it wrong.  Youre supposed to be selling 300000 KMD.  KMD is not ever allowed to go up.

Feels weird to see it go up

[23-Aug-19 08:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD is s 75 cent stablecoin heading to being a 50 cent stablecoin.  Not allowed to ever increase in value.  So stable.

1 big move of btc and we back to 7k range in a heartbeat

[23-Aug-19 08:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
alts?  what are you talking about.  BTC will be the only coin and fees will be $10000 per send

But green is always nice to see on a friday

[23-Aug-19 08:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
you can go on Coinbene, put a highish bid and the bots will move to your price. not sure how much to go up 30% but it's probably just a few btc. child's play.

[23-Aug-19 08:34 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Orderbook is pretty shallow anyway on binance, sells up to 10k only 16btc total

[23-Aug-19 08:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
it was a 10btc wall at 7.77k sats last week, now it's 25btc at 8k sats. seems like an experiment.

Weird that trades went through on bitmax. I would figure it isnt that hard to put some simple protection in place (if BTC price deviated more that x% from source A, B and C then all trading halts or something?)

I noticed a whole flurry of new altcoin exchanges- interesting, hopefully a cpl of these last a bit longer than the dead ones like craptsy, cryptopia etc..

[23-Aug-19 07:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
i noticed that as well. And the majority of alt's volume is going through non kyc exchanges. All of these potential criminals, such a shame.

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] altcoinist#1501
@actionslacks  why would criminals use unstable cryptocurrencies instead of cash?

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
