Talking about the India thing

[10-Jun-19 05:28 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Well it's gotta start somewhere

[10-Jun-19 06:37 AM] dxer666#8963
we need go to 22,23k

[10-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I say Zexo and our üòõ but I‚Äôm biased

[10-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Under 2m market cap, Dex with fiat gateway and government investment

[10-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And a crypto to fiat loan platform with revenue + stable coin + vc

[10-Jun-19 07:24 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Built on Komodo too :Komodo:

[10-Jun-19 07:45 AM] jansako#3330
I am with you on OUR, but what is the utility of ZEXO?

[10-Jun-19 07:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bnb style coin for zaddex exchange

[10-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yep. Lower fees, needed for project listing, buyback and burn etc

[10-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
33% of profit will be used to burn at market price with exchange *

[10-Jun-19 08:22 AM] jansako#3330
No fan of 'exchangecoins', but that is just me... I can see the utility for traders that are more than casual.

[10-Jun-19 08:49 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
It supports pirate as base pair and has fiat gateway, and will be used for vc investing. so I‚Äôm very interested to see where it goes. Launch should happen this month too

[10-Jun-19 08:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what you guys think of the release of Facebook's cryptocurrency white paper (18th June) will have effect on market?

[10-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Scott#9506
So when we going to hit 100k sat?

[10-Jun-19 08:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
tuesday

[10-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Scott#9506
sweet üòÉ

[10-Jun-19 08:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
don't ask which one

`FB whitepaper 18th of June = Thuesday as you said
if (facebookcoin.platform=='KMD'){
price.btc.sats=100000;
}`

[10-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I heard fbcoin isn't really blockchain

[10-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
It's more of a private database

[10-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
You need to pay like 10M to Facebook to run a node

[10-Jun-19 09:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
heard the same, yet need to learn about it

[10-Jun-19 09:16 AM] jansako#3330
running a node = having access to all user data = marketing goldmine? (that last point is arguable)

[10-Jun-19 09:22 AM] LocoMB#8593
I have already started stockpiling popcorn üçø for when the attacks on fbcoin start... impossible to imagine how f***book twats are _not_ going to fuck it up

[10-Jun-19 09:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
we've passed peak facebook, and this wont save it.

[10-Jun-19 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
>Speaking to German business magazine  WirtschaftsWoche earlier this week, Laura McCracken, Facebook‚Äôs head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, **confirmed that the planned stablecoin will not be tied to any single fiat currency, but will instead be linked to a basket of currencies in order to prevent volatility.**

[10-Jun-19 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
multiple fiat currencies ü§î

[10-Jun-19 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then I guess it won't be 1 fb coin = 1 USD

[10-Jun-19 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
could possibly be more

[10-Jun-19 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's odd way of stable coin, which I don't understand how it will work.... need education üòÑ

[10-Jun-19 10:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if it needs to be stable coin, will that be like the other cryptocurrency stable coins we have seen, or it can be something we have experienced with Komodo Platform's Pegged Asset Exchange currencies. This will be interesting things to learn.

[10-Jun-19 10:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And if it'll be very much like the existing fiat world where there's no limit of it's tokens supply, then I don't see why fb coin will be good to have.

[10-Jun-19 10:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are very unknowns from the articles I have read so far

[10-Jun-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if I just assume the same model as Apple's Card and financial solution adopted by the facebook in similar or modified way, I still don't see Facebook's currency  as appealing as open source cryptocurrency ecosystem.

[10-Jun-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Still being skeptical, and looking forward to the update on this

[10-Jun-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It'd be dumb to see people dumping Bitcoin and there cryptocurrencies for this FB Stablecoin

Facebook's 'GlobalCoin' Crypto Will Be Tied to Multiple Currencies...
A Facebook executive has told a German magazine that the firm's planned stablecoin will be tied to a basket of fiat currencies.

ü§î that's some prediction...

[10-Jun-19 10:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess Apple, and Facebook will not be much different from each other üòÑ , if that becomes true

[10-Jun-19 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if without spending and hodling some fbcoin will earn ppl some interest, that might be like passive income for some users in some countries.

[10-Jun-19 10:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm still learning things of economic world, jus ignore my comments.... üòÖ 
just a curious mind....

[10-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That's easy extra liquidity for fb

[10-Jun-19 10:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you read that Forbes article, it makes me more bullish on PIRATE

[10-Jun-19 10:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or any other ANON cryptocurrency which is superiorly anonymous. obviously PIRATE is so far the most superior anon

[10-Jun-19 10:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
FB is more like trying to be a global cryptocurrency for all nations, trying to compete with Bitcoin.

[10-Jun-19 11:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Crabby Paddy How can I exchange my mined zex for zexo?

[10-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@FishyGuts it was airdropped a while ago

[10-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Same private key = coins on new chain

[10-Jun-19 12:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hmmm ok. I‚Äôll look into it thanks.  And is RFOX still doing an airdrop?  Been a little busy at sea üò¨

Redfox i doing an airdrop for early Zaddex Holder - but problem is that these adresses for the upcoming Airdrop now are vulnerable

[10-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Acura#2748
Because snapshot already taken since a few months

[10-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Acura#2748
I hope for a solution because i‚Äòm waiting also for the airdrop on my old vulnerable adresses from the snapshot

[10-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or kmd can provide list of confirmed new adresses

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
should be pretty easy to replace old with new ones

[10-Jun-19 01:16 PM] SHossain#0007
guess, that can be done once we finish all refund

[10-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Acura#2748
But how can we replace the old adresses with new adresses .. 
i‚Äòm looking forward for a solution in the next weeks

[10-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
v lookup

[10-Jun-19 01:33 PM] crumb#2550
let's have a new snapshot, OK. i have more ZEXO now :abusedsmily:

[10-Jun-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
once the claims process is done, the snapshot to any compromised address changed to new one. it seems not that bad, but it has to be after the claims are done

[10-Jun-19 01:39 PM] crumb#2550
darnit!!! :abusedsmily: 
and i was hoping to get more üòõ

[10-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Acura#2748
I myself could still save my coins from the vulnerable addresses, so I didn't have to fill out the claiming form.
If a new snapshot would be taken, that would be a good solution.

[10-Jun-19 01:48 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
or just do the similar process like sending dust to affected zexo address and holder can send it to new address

[10-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I also moved the funds from a few addresses , only one of my address is moved by the team. And the address that has zexo snapshot is not the address that moved by the team. So I am in the same boat as Acura

[10-Jun-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i processed todays batch, of about 100 refunds, for approx 400,000 KMD. All properly claimed refunds smaller than 17777 KMD has been processed. I still see almost 200 who have not sent the funds from old address to new address. but at least we have about one third of the impacted accounts refunded already. 

if you did not receive a refund, then please contact support

When is binance wallet getting unlocked ?

Graviex supports dpow and so your deposits only need 5 confirmations, which usually only take a few minutes

[10-Jun-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
Last time I used DP + ARRR it took 4-6 hrs for my transaction to show up

[10-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
80 confirmations on last dp deposit here

[10-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So graviex might be the smoother option ;p

[10-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@JimD last I heard was after 15th of June

[10-Jun-19 03:54 PM] JimD#9272
Ahh, so massive dump inc

[10-Jun-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
80? that's like a record, isn't it?

[10-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@JimD not sure why you would think that

[10-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
only 8mio kmd affected, only reason might be traders capitalizing on recent gains

[10-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but those tend to keep their funds on exchange anyway

[10-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
binance has 5-10mio kmd on exchange

[10-Jun-19 03:57 PM] JimD#9272
There has been a lot of appreciation in the last couple days

[10-Jun-19 03:57 PM] JimD#9272
probably a few folks that want to capitalize but can't ATM

[10-Jun-19 03:59 PM] JimD#9272
Time will tell though

[10-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They can dump on digital price already

[10-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I believe they have opened deposits

Tbh, the way the team handled and is handling this is beyond compare and simply top notch

[10-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think many in the industry are recognizing this

[10-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362

from what i remember, only some top 10 exchanges have managed to protect the users 100% after a hack

[10-Jun-19 04:29 PM] Markus#5464
did bitmex ever get hacked? or do they keep all coins in cold storage considering u can only get ur withdraw once a day?
