no just a x20 increase of volume over the last 48 hours? hmm?

[13-Feb-19 01:17 AM] richardt#2807
Historically, KMD has only had major price increases with a countdown (like the one in 2017) or when everything else pumps.  So just wondering 😃

[13-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Alecandro#1179
Well I speculate that KMD is in its end phase of heavy accumulation and might be starting its new uptrend

[13-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Likewise#6767
I surely hope so

[13-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it is

[13-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Likewise#6767
I'd like us to test and break the 31 dec high at 0.000251

[13-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
everyone who sells KMD now is a noob

[13-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
only exceeded by the noobs who sold it last week

[13-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Likewise#6767
I have only been buying lately

[13-Feb-19 01:20 AM] Likewise#6767
not really trading it more holding it, like the 5% interest

KMD/BTC Wyckoff accumulation range for BINANCE:KMDBTC by eyupium
I am not familiar with the fundamentals of this coin, nor have I read any news about it.
However, a very good example of a Wyckoff accumulation range, complete with the matching volume profile on each step and phase of the accumulation has been formed here.

Waiting for the l...

[13-Feb-19 01:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah the interest is nice, makes people withdraw it from exchanges

[13-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Likewise#6767
Indeed, if all good it should be a winner, collecting the 5% till reaches desirable target.

[13-Feb-19 01:23 AM] richardt#2807
I guess we shall see... If anything, hopefully this will bring more positive attention to KMD

[13-Feb-19 01:24 AM] Likewise#6767
I'm thinking once a overall bull run starts KMD will be among the better performing ones

[13-Feb-19 01:25 AM] Likewise#6767
AFAIK.......?

[13-Feb-19 01:26 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yea I agree @Likewise. The KMD team has put over a year into development and now it’s the year to market and build

[13-Feb-19 01:27 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes, As soon as it has broader attention we should be golden.

[13-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Likewise#6767
it is getting there if we look back at the interst on social media it has increased, good sign

[13-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Alecandro#1179
👍🏼

[13-Feb-19 01:58 AM] richardt#2807
It's nice that it's getting a lot of attention from day-traders on Twitter - for now.  What it really needs is more attention from companies/projects to build on the platform.

[13-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Alecandro#1179
Which I think it’s really starting to as well

[13-Feb-19 02:40 AM] Likewise#6767
I think it has been getting more attention then just from day traders

I’d say ask Mike Tout @Hollowman9000 about that whole shutdown thing but I’m not sure he had a hand in that.

[13-Feb-19 08:15 AM] dokrates#8987
very nice

[13-Feb-19 08:15 AM] dokrates#8987
after the pump, now the dump

[13-Feb-19 10:26 AM] ch6ris#5240
conflicted. I just know it's gonna come come crashing down, but I did buy more

[13-Feb-19 10:28 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Remember that time kmd went from 18k to 22k in 24hrs. Good old days lol

[13-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and vrsc

[13-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
have been buying for a year

[13-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
any price ranging from 15k-50k is still 'the bottom'

[13-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
long term wise

[13-Feb-19 10:57 AM] ch6ris#5240
Why vrsc? I don't know a bunch about it.

[13-Feb-19 11:27 AM] yorklab#7270
The time will come when people selling just after a small run will get burned. They will have to buy back at a higher price.

[13-Feb-19 11:42 AM] ch6ris#5240
maybe.

[13-Feb-19 01:45 PM] ch6ris#5240
I left trex because kyc

[13-Feb-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
many people left bittrex because of kyc

[13-Feb-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i personally dont use it much since they only accept wire transfers

[13-Feb-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
coinbase has ACH transactions which are more efficient for the daily small volume trader

[13-Feb-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if they did ACH i would have used it more.

[13-Feb-19 01:47 PM] ch6ris#5240
yeah totally agree, I usually buy "something" on coinbase, transfer to binance and buy kmd.

[13-Feb-19 01:48 PM] ch6ris#5240
coinbase are pretty sucky though, very expensive.

[13-Feb-19 01:50 PM] ch6ris#5240
