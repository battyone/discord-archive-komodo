[27-Oct-19 02:01 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@polycryptoblog I saw another concept in where every 5-10 minutes, users would put their prediction in of over/under on let's say a computer generated Bitcoin price.

[27-Oct-19 02:02 AM] Privatoshi#9487
The further you put your prediction in from the start, the more weight your return would be, if correct.

[27-Oct-19 04:09 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
What would predictions cc look like? Would it be similar to people making their  own bet on a coin price to hit x price by y date, or to be above x price on y day, and orderbooks with open bets and amount of bet remaining to be filled?

[27-Oct-19 04:09 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would be interested to see something like that made üòÆ

[27-Oct-19 04:18 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it will probably be like bitmex , betting on bitcoin prices

[27-Oct-19 04:18 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and Arthur Hayes becomes a billionaire because of that üòÑ It helps with him being located in hongkong where gambling is a lifestyle

[27-Oct-19 04:29 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
His breakthrough was when he increases the leverage limit from 3X to 100X in 2015 on his platform

[27-Oct-19 04:30 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The platform over the past 18 months has become the most liquid place to trade crypto risk globally because of that

[27-Oct-19 04:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
So to increase KMD/ or other coin liquidity, probably people could do similar thing now that cc-pegs is available

[27-Oct-19 04:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes they can .

[27-Oct-19 04:40 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Somebody could even do a whole new STO for this project - maybe called it Madmex üòÑ

[27-Oct-19 04:43 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and just follow the path of bitmex / it's model and make it better

[27-Oct-19 05:48 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Bitmex is leverage trading

[27-Oct-19 05:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Predictions cc could be many different things

[27-Oct-19 06:52 AM] Flint#6435
@bishop  it is said that until February the price will be taken around $ 2 for the whole time, and not that by March 1 the price will be $ 2; the price from today to March 2020 can take $ 2 several times and drop to 0.6 and again fly to the moon and fall to the bottom again - it is only important where the main support levels are! The only important thing is the accumulation of kmd due to rate fluctuations!

[27-Oct-19 08:02 AM] Lanii#8302
there are no supports left, all major supports on kmd were broken on the way down

[27-Oct-19 08:03 AM] Lanii#8302
atm in price discovery mode untill we can shift a higher time frame trend to the upside, only then can we potentially make new supports to buy of

[27-Oct-19 10:35 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Caglio already sold, bottom can be far off

[27-Oct-19 11:17 AM] cascrypto#8206
give us more hopium bitfinger when will btc dominance crumble?

when kmd ecosystem 10% dominance is the real question tbh

[27-Oct-19 11:29 AM] Markus#5464
would be nice to have like 5 kmd ecosystem projects in the top 100

[27-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Lanii#8302
wouldnt touch kmd with a 10 feet pole untill we can get above 650 ish sats again

[27-Oct-19 11:48 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Markus what projects are there currently?

[27-Oct-19 11:48 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
and where is that ecosystem data to be found?

[27-Oct-19 12:13 PM] cascrypto#8206
I would say, chips, pirate, atomic dex, pangea en antara

[27-Oct-19 12:15 PM] cascrypto#8206
hush, heat, chainzilla, coqui, coincollect and kmd/dice would also do VRSC has also a high potential

[27-Oct-19 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
pirate dex and vrsc prob highest possibility atm to reach top 100

[27-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Markus#5464
@umitkara48 nope

[27-Oct-19 02:43 PM] Oszy#5734
btc really wanna go up today

[27-Oct-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
wondering when alts will do that aswell ü§î

[27-Oct-19 02:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
At ath for btc

[27-Oct-19 02:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Btc closing the week above 10k would be awesome

[27-Oct-19 02:45 PM] Markus#5464
so that means alts will suffer for another 2 years

[27-Oct-19 02:46 PM] Markus#5464
a bull cycle is typical 4 years, bottomed out end of last year

[27-Oct-19 03:21 PM] 74D30#6106
Pack your bags. The train will be leaving soon

[27-Oct-19 03:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No, i dont think it will take 2 more years for ath

[27-Oct-19 03:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This weekly candle needs to close above 20sma in btc

Sorry  @cascrypto I don't have any hopium for dominance, I don't chart it, I think it's a crappy indicator. Amazing that btc manages to keep going even with all the new coins popping up every day.

[27-Oct-19 04:12 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Btc looking a bit iffy at the moment. I have a lot of blues to be retraced on that pump, but not sure when. It's making bear divs straight into bull divs, so looks like everyone wants to btfd

10k here we go

[27-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe it will form cup and handle and shoot to 16k by 31 oct

[27-Oct-19 04:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
it certainly looks like it wants to do something

[27-Oct-19 04:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if the dish ran away with the spoon, but there is no spoon, did the dish fling a saucer to fly over the moon and smash the half full cup which in its broken state now overflows?

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] designer#4893
this bull season, regardless of the technology advantage, the market will be full of fomo.

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dunno, its my TA tho and it has to mean something. Orange coin up I recon.

[27-Oct-19 04:51 PM] designer#4893
still, the era of blockchain becoming mainstream takes time.

[27-Oct-19 04:52 PM] designer#4893
that is a normal market in which money flows.

[27-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the volume is not high enough

[27-Oct-19 04:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you asked 90% of people if tcp/ip would become mainstream, they'd probably just stare like confused dog and then walk away and pee on something.

heheheh

[27-Oct-19 04:58 PM] designer#4893
because of that point, I like komodo and feel stuffy.

[27-Oct-19 04:59 PM] designer#4893
good technology, but what good is it if the public doesn't know and don't use it?

[27-Oct-19 05:00 PM] designer#4893
I think there is a need to shake the market if the market does not become wise.

[27-Oct-19 05:00 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
for public to use it has to be seamless

[27-Oct-19 05:08 PM] designer#4893
I think the bigger problem is not even starting to use it.

[27-Oct-19 05:10 PM] designer#4893
after the launch of Atomic DEX, the download of the app store seems to be not up to par.

[27-Oct-19 05:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thousands of beta downloads aint too bad. I'm having fun anyway, because I'm staying up all night, writing code, learning more stuff and going to sleep at sunrise.

[27-Oct-19 05:22 PM] designer#4893
It's like early investors are going to have to sacrifice themselves for the komodo and the ecosystem to grow. It's a dilemma for investors.

sacrifice how? I sacrifice sleep, and buy on the cheap. when price gets fomo, seems sacrifice is rewards.

[27-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Neko#5830
komodo doesnt even need much to pump

[27-Oct-19 05:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If kmd manages to get above 0.66$ before 12am utc i would be happy and TA too

[27-Oct-19 06:43 PM] Markus#5464
@Lanii im quite sure we can go below 1k if btc decides to go insane and go straight to 16k upcoming days

[27-Oct-19 06:43 PM] Lanii#8302

[27-Oct-19 06:43 PM] Lanii#8302

[27-Oct-19 06:45 PM] Lanii#8302
However sats wise its gonna get destroyed

[27-Oct-19 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
