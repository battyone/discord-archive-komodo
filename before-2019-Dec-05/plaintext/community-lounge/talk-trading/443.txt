Brock Pierce just posted this, claiming bear is over.

[26-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Markus#5464
there will always be ppl who are not convinced bear is over even if btc would reach 6k, seen "analysis" that btc will go to 6k then to 2k which is mind blowing to me, if that would be the case it can only happen with massive manipulation

[26-Feb-19 05:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Other things aside manipulation makes prices move üòÅ

Bear is far from over 2021

[26-Feb-19 05:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think that sometimes people think Bull markets are short time frames like Nov-Dec 2017.  

Fact is it took 8 months or more of growth to run up to that last segment.  

Just because 2x-5x isn‚Äôt happening today doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt be considered bullish as an outlook. 

All that said I‚Äôm not a trader, just a sentiment guy. üòú

[26-Feb-19 06:12 PM] Alecandro#1179
woah kmd to 26k again

[26-Feb-19 06:13 PM] Alecandro#1179
damn another huge spike in volume took us up to 27.5k that time

[26-Feb-19 06:14 PM] Alecandro#1179

BTC, not going anywhere after this manipulated sell off what some tend to call a correction. That is not a correction

KMD, little to no progress CLose 18/2 2565 Close 26/2  2628.........

[27-Feb-19 01:21 AM] Likewise#6767
IT is the daily close we look at, not the spikes in day.

[27-Feb-19 01:27 AM] Likewise#6767
basically with all the wash trading going on it is impossible to follow the orderbook,

[27-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Likewise#6767
it serves no use

[27-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Markus#5464
yea even with this spikes volume is not great

im surprised about the price spikes during so low volume

then think about decentralized, ALL the crypto exchanges are the complete opposite, basically 90%  of what goes on is the opposite yet banks are bad and are scammes, the sheer hypocrisy in thsi scene us unreal and a comedy really üòÉ

[27-Feb-19 01:34 AM] Likewise#6767
you got guys like Voorhees, Ver and other scammers, we are working for the industry blablabla, no guy stop lying, you have been adding to your own bank account as we all tend to do. No issues with it but they make it look like they are the messiah. Comedy show üòâ

[27-Feb-19 01:36 AM] Likewise#6767
do you guys remember BTC 8K 2018, buy last time we will see it this low. I was still shorting at that time and being ridiculed for it. Guess whi is laughing now, where are the 2018 dip buyers by the way?

[27-Feb-19 01:36 AM] Likewise#6767
BSV is üòÉ

[27-Feb-19 01:37 AM] Likewise#6767
Then what dot the crypto kids, influencers and more of that sorts do. block or mute u on twitter for being right lol. Seriously guys, if anybody wants this to be taking seriously the kids need to get a job first or something.

[27-Feb-19 01:39 AM] Likewise#6767
ok BTC forecast; a chance of retest the lows, maybe we will break them, maybe not. Also maybe we might be testing the highs however very doubtful, again maybe. üòÉ

what do u think about kmd tho

[27-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Markus#5464
when it comes to price that will say

[27-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Likewise#6767
Not sure, KMD seems to be holding up fairly well for now. Does that really mean anything? Not sure bro, look at RCN, no idea what it is but been pumping40+%. Just to indicate, as long as we dont know when these orginzed groups pump or dump I tend to just watch thsi shiot show. Still got my short BTC from yesterday on though.

[27-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Likewise#6767
But the talks I have with retail higher end investors, guys in my situation, most find it laughable because of all the wash trading and all sorts of manipulation.

[27-Feb-19 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and normal stocks markets dont have that?

[27-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Likewise#6767
