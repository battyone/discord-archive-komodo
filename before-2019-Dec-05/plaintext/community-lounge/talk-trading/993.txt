which competition

[01-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Markus#5464
what can u compare kmd with

[01-Aug-19 04:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
IOTA has quite some partnerships, but the most important thing is they have to prove that the Coordinator can be removed

[01-Aug-19 04:09 PM] dan.#2473
thats just an obtuse question markus lol

[01-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Markus#5464
really

[01-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Markus#5464
tell me

[01-Aug-19 04:09 PM] dan.#2473
:troll_lol:

[01-Aug-19 04:10 PM] dan.#2473
theres 2000 active coins markus

[01-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Markus#5464
Yes most are made on Eth

[01-Aug-19 04:10 PM] dan.#2473
right, but they all have websites

[01-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Markus#5464
how is that competition

[01-Aug-19 04:10 PM] dan.#2473
thats 2k crypto websites on google, inbound marketing alone has a 2k other sites to compete with

[01-Aug-19 04:11 PM] dan.#2473
my point is, inbound marketing isnt enough

[01-Aug-19 04:12 PM] dan.#2473
looks kewl to us, but how does anyone know

[01-Aug-19 04:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
how do you think eth feels? they have THE fucking smart contract platform and  they cant get a break out to save their lives.

[01-Aug-19 04:14 PM] dan.#2473
absolutely all alts are feeling the pain

[01-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Markus#5464
Exactly all alts feel the pain so why is marketing failing for kmd?

[01-Aug-19 04:16 PM] dan.#2473
ive highlighted all those reasons above, im not measuring the success personally in satoshis

[01-Aug-19 04:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
this isn't a marathon, now it's a war of attrition. and govt may be about to join the enemy ranks.

[01-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Markus#5464
govt got no choice, their systems failed and are about to get replaced

[01-Aug-19 04:17 PM] LocoMB#8593
this thing with '2000 active coins' reminds me of some collectors catalogue of obscure and worthless postage stamps..

i am guessing what happened is they got the lite package from that marketing agency... appearance wise, pretty decent, but then they cashed their check and left. modern marketing is a multi-faceted campaign. If doing marketing at all, needs to be carried out fully.

[01-Aug-19 04:20 PM] dan.#2473
i'd be curious to know more about that

[01-Aug-19 04:22 PM] dan.#2473
i think so too. I do hope to see a nice push when the atomicdex is out of beta

[01-Aug-19 04:22 PM] dan.#2473
yes, community voting works well for 80 percent of topics

[01-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
bitcoin took 10 years to be in current position, KMD is barely 2 years old

[01-Aug-19 04:24 PM] dan.#2473
yes they can go hand in hand though. marketing goal should be more users, or a bigger community.

[01-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Neko#5830
kmd will happen, it may take 18 months for real unlike LN

[01-Aug-19 04:25 PM] dan.#2473
anyways, im really done being a contrarian for the time being, love yall else id of left years ago

[01-Aug-19 04:26 PM] dan.#2473
nice, thats great

[01-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
soon KMD will be number 1

Should have invested in bitcoin

[01-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Caglio#3337
I start to understand bitcoin maximalists lately

[01-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Caglio#3337
Also I am not unhappy with litecoin

[01-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Caglio#3337
Bought some @ 250

[01-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Caglio#3337
But bought some @ 25

[01-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Caglio#3337
So its not that bad

[01-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Markus#5464

[01-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 04:35 PM] dan.#2473

[01-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Markus#5464

[01-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Markus#5464

[01-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not unhappy with ltc

[01-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337
my biggest entry was 250 bucks

[01-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337
its 150% down

[01-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Caglio#3337
kmd is 600% down

[01-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Caglio#3337
But like I said, I bought ltc @ 25 also, so I am not really lost money on that one

[01-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Markus#5464
so it was ur own fault to hold during a bear market i would say

[01-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If one of my other bags hits big, I‚Äôm cutting $1M from the profits there and buying $1M from the sell side slowly over a few weeks, then dumping it all at once just so I can hear you all reeeee louder
