there is also around 5 different tokens i have been dropped to my Eos addy already. i have no idea what they are either.

i reckon very soon you will see PPI like companies cold calling you to see weather you have ever had a btc / eth / eos funded balance and they will handle airdrop claims for you that you never knew you had.

@Lumbi more miners doesnt mean more coins mined?

[11-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it just means the coins go to the miners with most hashpower

[11-Jul-18 02:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
unless they found an exploit that makes it easier to mine coins without being noticed

[11-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no clue how that would work tho

[11-Jul-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
true, an average of ~2880 new coins per day is 2880 new coins per day if 1 person mining or 1 trillion

[11-Jul-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
but I think that he was meaning that the price is depressed because miners are dumping rather than holding

[11-Jul-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if we count coins on short lived forks, that is the only way having more miners creates more coins, but it is only a temporary effect

[11-Jul-18 03:01 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Miners with more advanced hardware in private hands (russian private mines for example designed own hardware.. ) Some FPGA and Asics farms are at work and can sell at bottom prices with still big in profits.. not so for gaming gpu cards miners.. even those with lowest elec rates soon.

`Its all about money and they dont care about crypto.. sadly enough`
The irony that you have in that defensive position is staggering.
Since "crypto" is short for "crypto-currency", what you're really saying is:

Other than an electronic means of currency secured by cryptography, what is it that you believe "cryptocurrency fundamentally stands for"?

A currency without the possibility to just print some billions because a central bank approves it.
A currency that has no debts to it.
A currency that isnt controlled by banks.
A currency peer to peer .. excluding the hand of the middle man.

Not one single person, ever, has traded currency based on any reason other than financial gain
