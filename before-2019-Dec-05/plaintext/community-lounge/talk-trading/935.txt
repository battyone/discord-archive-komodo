What is the new logo supposed to look like/symbolize?

[16-Jul-19 12:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Planting the seed

[16-Jul-19 12:19 PM] Markus#5464
next logo will be a grown tree

[16-Jul-19 12:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have heard that’s how it’s done. Komodo vagina looks... like a relaxed fit.

She’s been around a few whales

troll_lol 🥁 

[16-Jul-19 12:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
But seriously, is there any symbolism or is it just some goo dripping out of a C?

[16-Jul-19 12:23 PM] p.#1126
Whale anus full of goop

[16-Jul-19 12:23 PM] p.#1126

it represents how easy it is to deploy new Smart Chains and the interconnectivety between them. If someone makes a new innovation it ban be adopted by the rest of the smart chains.

shexy 

[16-Jul-19 12:34 PM] Audo#5667
so you could think the middle circle to represent KMD and the smaller circle a newly created Smart Chain

[16-Jul-19 12:35 PM] Caglio#3337

@meatspoon ofc cos its stolen

[16-Jul-19 12:36 PM] Caglio#3337
and its totally dumb

[16-Jul-19 12:36 PM] Caglio#3337
its growing up

[16-Jul-19 12:36 PM] Caglio#3337
then its going back to the roots?

[16-Jul-19 12:36 PM] Caglio#3337
shouldnt be other way around

[16-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Caglio#3337
doesnt it give a fruit when it grows up?

[16-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Caglio#3337

>logic
>arguing over a logo

[16-Jul-19 12:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
not sure if people are arguing, really.  Just having reactions.  I will say, that that 3 image progression that Audo posted doesnt make much sense at all.  That is some serious marketing masturbation right there...  Seedling plus power button equals weird goo-logo.

👌 

[16-Jul-19 12:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
they should have focus-grouped that a little harder.

[16-Jul-19 12:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
but, hey, at least one human being spent about a year scratching their head to come up with that.  Makes me feel like i am in the wrong business

[16-Jul-19 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I do like the logo. It explains itself.

[16-Jul-19 01:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
How about a solid green C and solid yellow bulby ball thing

[16-Jul-19 01:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Back to the roots 😛 I think it would look good

[16-Jul-19 01:17 PM] Malti#3948
Or maybe an apple with a bite taken out, that makes a lot of sense

[16-Jul-19 01:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
an apple with a bite out has a lot more symbolism

[16-Jul-19 01:17 PM] Malti#3948
Look at the website. It’s amazing. The content amazing

[16-Jul-19 01:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
not that i am a fan of Apple.  But it represents knowledge, right?  biblical shit

[16-Jul-19 01:18 PM] Malti#3948
And this represents the growth of smart chains and ecosystem

[16-Jul-19 01:19 PM] Malti#3948
At least that is how I read it

[16-Jul-19 01:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
i have seen worse logos, dont get me wrong.  This one just doesnt blow my hair back.  There are lots of words in the crypto world that could have been leveraged.  "chain" or "ecosystem" come to mind.  Hell, "Komodo" is the name of the project and that is not reflected at all in the logo.

[16-Jul-19 01:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I’d prefer even 3 “rectangle blocks” representing different chains stacked on top of each other in green and yellow 😅

[16-Jul-19 01:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
It’s too futuristic and tryhard for crypto logo imo

[16-Jul-19 01:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
agreed

[16-Jul-19 01:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Everything else though

[16-Jul-19 01:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
👌👌

[16-Jul-19 01:25 PM] jorian#4555
tech doesn't care about logos. also, nothing stops anyone from creating a new brand and shipping products using all komodo tech since it's all open source
