we know the blockhash for 1000000 and 1000010, right?

[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
we can get the headers for all the blocks between them and make sure they connect backwards to the prior block and that 1000010 matches

[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
now we know we have valid notarized headers for those 11 blocks

[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the utxo at height 1000005 gets a merkle txproof to show it is part of the merkleroot of 1000005

[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
which is in the header that was between notarizations

[30-Jun-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the key here is that each header has the previous blockhash

[30-Jun-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can link backwards and verify that a specific segment between 1000000 and 1000010 are all valid, without any other data

Its like u were born to do this JL,  its basically a normal day for u to find something what nobody did before

[30-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Markus#5464
I dont see how other projects will ever catch up in this speed

[30-Jun-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i just had a hard time reading the flyclient paper... too much math, too many attack vectors to deal with

[30-Jun-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i trust they do just fine, but i realized in a flash that using notarized data, we avoid 99%+ of the issues, and dont need 99.9%+ of the data

[30-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Markus#5464
thats efficiency  right there

[30-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Markus#5464
dont make it harder then it have to be

[30-Jun-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly!

[30-Jun-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
validate the segment of the blockchain that notarized the utxo

[30-Jun-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you have many utxo, if they are clumped within the same segment, there is no need to get the same data again

kmd chart following and respecting fibonacci like it was meant to be

[30-Jun-19 01:20 PM] FBTroy#9693
@jl777c Could this break through with the nSPV node ever lead to a automatic claim function in a wallet, or does requiring a manual claim periodically have nothing to do with managing the size and speed? I wish I could just put my KMD into a wallet and check back to monitor the power of compounding.

[30-Jun-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
requiring a manual claim has nothing to do with nSPV

[30-Jun-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if you didnt have to do anything, then you wouldnt be very active

[30-Jun-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to reward active users

[30-Jun-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
not to make it fully automatic

[30-Jun-19 01:24 PM] FBTroy#9693
Ok, I see, I thought it was contributing in some way just by being staked.

[30-Jun-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt staking

[30-Jun-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
all utxo >= 10 are accruing rewards for up to a month,not just the ones with enough to stake a block

[30-Jun-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
there are only 1440 * 30 blocks in a month, if to require staking a block to collect like most other coins with rewards, it would skew things toward the larger balances

[30-Jun-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is it is possible for literally 10 million people to be accruing rewards in the same month

[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but that would require 10 million people to all have 10 KMD

[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] FBTroy#9693
I am not very technical, so I appreciate the explanation.

[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Markus#5464
Are rewards based on time/date when they are recieved in the wallet? Also does month end from day they are recieved in the wallet or by end of month by calendar?

[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the seconds are counted

[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
31 days worth of seconds is the limit

[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Markus#5464
Ok

[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
rounded to nearest minute, minus one hour

[30-Jun-19 01:30 PM] FBTroy#9693
I still am not sure why building in a claim alarm or auto claim every x date would be bad. I want to make crypto use, and particularly KMD as user friendly as possible to encourage use, to provide value that others do not provide.

[30-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Oszy#5734
`building in a claim alarm` set  your calendar alarm for every 30 days

[30-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Markus#5464
mobile alarm üòâ

[30-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Oszy#5734
`auto claim every x date` - not difficult to program, anyone can do himself, but jl won't do it for you

[30-Jun-19 01:33 PM] FBTroy#9693
I get that but think beyond that. Think of the extremely tech challenged. My parents for instance. üòÉ

[30-Jun-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to motivate your parents to figure out how to send funds

[30-Jun-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if 5% per year is not enough incentive for them to learn how to make payments, then it isnt enough

[30-Jun-19 01:34 PM] FBTroy#9693
I cant get them not to open virus riddled email from friends. Because you know, your friends would never send a virus infested attachment.

[30-Jun-19 01:34 PM] Oszy#5734
smartphone? chameleon wallet has claim option

[30-Jun-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yet you want them to run some automated process with their privkey, running all the time??

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[30-Jun-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
5% rewards are for users who are active and able to claim them

[30-Jun-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
or just people that send funds, that automatically gains rewards

[30-Jun-19 01:36 PM] FBTroy#9693
You are a technical problem solver, I am trying to think of ways to make the user experience as easy as can be, so that it may be a small amount of learning, but more along the lines of learning how to use email.

[30-Jun-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i stop nobody from making such things

[30-Jun-19 01:36 PM] FBTroy#9693
I know üòÉ

[30-Jun-19 01:38 PM] FBTroy#9693
Is it bad to have your wallet running all the time in lite mode?

[30-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Oszy#5734
what's the point of running it all the time anyway?

[30-Jun-19 01:41 PM] FBTroy#9693
I look at my Verus mining each day for rewards on a computer running in lite mode. Just never bother to close it.

[30-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Oszy#5734
you can check that on the explorer without risk

[30-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Oszy#5734
leaving the wallet open is always a risk

[30-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Oszy#5734
it's like leaving your seed on a piece of paper next to the computer

[30-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Oszy#5734
well that's less risky for cyberattacks but you get my point üòÑ

[30-Jun-19 01:42 PM] FBTroy#9693
Thank you @Oszy  I did not realize that. I will close it up from now on.

[30-Jun-19 01:47 PM] FBTroy#9693
Is having a native version running and mining the same risk on the risk scale?

[30-Jun-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
not if your wallet is encrypted

[30-Jun-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but that wont work if ztransactions are involved

I am going to have to look at cli now. For trading talk, I would like to see us get above 12k just for some cushion.

I feel like I let @jl777c  down, he must feel like me when my parents pay 300 dollars for a windows warranty they bought from the nice man on the phone.

@Markus  There is just no selling pressure. This should go go go if we can just get people looking at KMD

[30-Jun-19 02:07 PM] Oszy#5734
bots accumulated a lot down in the 1100-1130 area need to wait for more volume

[30-Jun-19 02:07 PM] FBTroy#9693
I think people know about the rebrand and the tech, they are just on the sidelines or in other things keeping an eye on it. If it starts to move it will force them to move

[30-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Markus#5464
only thing what make sense is for ppl that bought down at 9-10k to take some profits at this lvl...but considering how oversold it is yet might aswell wait for even more free profits

Jumped completely out and into link from 19 to 27, which helped. Got out of that a little to early.

[30-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Markus#5464
i bought around 14-15k never thinking it would ever go this low dropping down from almost 23k but considering btc going parabolic dont think anyone could expect this to happen

[30-Jun-19 02:11 PM] FBTroy#9693
@Markus So true. It will go back, I have no doubt.

[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Oszy#5734
