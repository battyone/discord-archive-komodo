theres a video a guy explaining in 5 years time if EOS will keep getting adoption then it could reach up to 500tb if they dont find a solution for it

[03-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Markus#5464
with only 5 block producers storing the full history

[03-Mar-19 06:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
Sounds not sustainable

[03-Mar-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
for the amount they get paid, EOS block producers should be required to run full nodes!

_Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean._

[04-Mar-19 01:26 AM] Sdunbar#5064

[04-Mar-19 04:19 AM] Markus#5464

[04-Mar-19 05:00 AM] Markus#5464
hopefully we hold 23k so that this whole upwards move was not for no reason xD

We should be bouncing from this area; We could use a website launch as a catalyst right now

Time to buy!

[04-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Keppie#5156
Glad i got some bids filled on the fib retracement levels

[04-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Keppie#5156
It's just bitcoin that is looking so fishy. Might ruin the party

After many years of ridicule, one day, one day I will sue you all for the following reasons...

1) You don’t believe me
2) You violate my patents
3) You are mean to me
4) You don’t like me
5) I don’t like me
6) Maybe the judge will like me

trading comp until march 8th so maybe after that we move back up

[04-Mar-19 01:39 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
golden cross though on the daily

[04-Mar-19 01:40 PM] Keppie#5156
Trading comp includes buying

[04-Mar-19 01:40 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea I know lol

[04-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Keppie#5156
These sellers will eventually start buying if they want to win this comp.

[04-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Keppie#5156
Kind of a fishy competition if you ask me

[04-Mar-19 01:42 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea very true

[04-Mar-19 01:42 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
Im happy if we hold above 22k

[04-Mar-19 01:45 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
nice to see the daily volume stay above 1 million for a change

[04-Mar-19 01:48 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
Gold and crypto down and stock markets up

[04-Mar-19 01:49 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821

[04-Mar-19 02:45 PM] Tek#5253
whalebro was huobi exchange buying in  a shit ton of kmd to overtake it from binance

[04-Mar-19 02:45 PM] Tek#5253
🤔

[04-Mar-19 04:38 PM] richardt#2807
Does seem a bit like manipulation to get prices down, buy more and get ready for another pump

[04-Mar-19 04:40 PM] richardt#2807
Wouldn't be surprised if Huobi is in on it

[04-Mar-19 05:00 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I personally  don't like the  trade comp, no matter how hard you trade, exchanges could just theoretically beat you with a bot

[04-Mar-19 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, build a better bot

{Reactions}
👆 

[04-Mar-19 05:04 PM] PHBA2061#2530
what I meant is even with a better bot, traders will still lose trading fee, while exchanges don't

[04-Mar-19 05:05 PM] richardt#2807
Looks like the coinbene wash-trading bot needs to adjust its price 😄

[04-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@PHBA2061 marketmakers also dont pay fees

[04-Mar-19 05:18 PM] Markus#5464
Huobi KMD/ETH from almost 6 mil volume to 260k, what a beautiful balance 😄

[04-Mar-19 05:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Couldn't someone theoretically be taking a 10% loss on all their trades, hoping to regain it in the KMD they win plus the price growth afterwards without so much BS market sell pressure?

[04-Mar-19 05:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Trading comps have not once produced higher prices in my experience, but I haven't been around that long.

[04-Mar-19 05:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Seems like a FANTASTIC way for exchanges to earn money on fees.

[04-Mar-19 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
trading comp will almost certainly only benefit people who already had bots written for it
