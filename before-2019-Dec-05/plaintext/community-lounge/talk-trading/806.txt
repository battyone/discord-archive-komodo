[22-Jun-19 01:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
It wont take that long, by then at least half the top 100 will be gone

[22-Jun-19 02:00 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
to me KMD is a $250 coins easily

[22-Jun-19 02:01 AM] yorklab#7270
Hopefully as July 15th approaches things will change. I just wish Bitcoin would take an extended break.

[22-Jun-19 02:01 AM] actionslacks#4072

[22-Jun-19 02:02 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821

Why look at that chart

[22-Jun-19 02:04 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
KMD just doesn't have a big exchange like Coinbase to help the price....

[22-Jun-19 02:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol, even spam is coming

[22-Jun-19 02:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It has binance, that is big enough

[22-Jun-19 02:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It doesnt have usdt pair tho

[22-Jun-19 02:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It has a usd pair

[22-Jun-19 02:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No volume üò¨

[22-Jun-19 02:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Only 55 sats to go below 13k

[22-Jun-19 02:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[22-Jun-19 02:34 AM] ryman112#0068
Lol

[22-Jun-19 02:35 AM] ryman112#0068
Most people figured it was U.S. customers selling alts for BTC to get out of binance but if that was the case the cap wouldn't change all that much.  This is something completely different

[22-Jun-19 02:36 AM] ryman112#0068
Cap could very well be in the 400s by tomorrow

[22-Jun-19 02:37 AM] actionslacks#4072

[22-Jun-19 02:39 AM] ryman112#0068
Except the STL Blues winning the Stanley Cup.  That was epic

[22-Jun-19 02:52 AM] tolken#2655
History will be made when KMD takes its rightful throne in the top 10 üòÉ

[22-Jun-19 02:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
btc has to finish the fireworks show first. everything on binance is getting murdered until it does

Bitcoin surpassed $10,000. the world is going to be noisy again. It is time for the intellectual and philosophical circles to seriously explore the fact that Bitcoin is strong.
