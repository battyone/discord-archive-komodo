heh. protip, there's faster speeds than the speed of light

[26-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Tek#5253
@Alright dash decided 2mb blocks in 2016

[26-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Tek#5253
after a voting round

[26-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Tek#5253
it took 2 weeks

[26-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
and block time?

[26-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Tek#5253
litecoin fork initally

[26-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Tek#5253
2.5 minutes then

[26-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Alright#0419
and what's its plan to scale?

[26-Aug-19 03:36 PM] Tek#5253
512mb blocks are in the scaling plan

[26-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
that won't work...

[26-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Tek#5253
yeah yeah lets just wait until they get there

[26-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Alright#0419
if you give me some BCHSV, I'll demonstrate why that won't work üòõ

[26-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Tek#5253
i don't have faketoshi coin

[26-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
pretty confused why no one is demonstrating how large of a problem they have created

[26-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
BCH even has an issue I imagine

[26-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Tek#5253
BCH is building avalanche preconsensus

[26-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Tek#5253
Basically, what Dash already has

[26-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
fill a block with as many inputs as you can, and you have a couple minutes more to find a solution to another block to replace it

[26-Aug-19 03:40 PM] Alright#0419
>spam the network with txes with many many inputs
>mine empty blocks

[26-Aug-19 03:40 PM] pinkcookie#4334
@Tek  are you mining dash

[26-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Tek#5253
you cant replace the block cause the MN network governs it

[26-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
surely I can, not really the point though

[26-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
those "chainlocks" don't happen prior to validation

[26-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
there is no way they do

[26-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Tek#5253
they do

[26-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Tek#5253
go read about it

[26-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
they cannot üò´

[26-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Tek#5253
the masternode network holds a cache of what happens based on the last block

[26-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Tek#5253
then when the next block is found they add the entire cache of happenings in

[26-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Tek#5253
( i don't know the fine details )

[26-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
they cannot say "this block is the block we agree on" *prior* to validating the block

[26-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
and if they do, that's some broken shit

[26-Aug-19 03:43 PM] Tek#5253
well read into it cause i was pretty sure they found a way to do that

[26-Aug-19 03:43 PM] Tek#5253
they have been working on this shit for over 2 years

[26-Aug-19 03:43 PM] Tek#5253
i have to go

[26-Aug-19 03:43 PM] Tek#5253
later

BNB lending for 15% interest a year: sounds too good to be true to me? Anyone read more about this?

[26-Aug-19 04:04 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Besides the fact that you have to keep your coins on Binance

[26-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Markus#5464
15% is not much

[26-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Markus#5464
If u bought btc in january and only held it up to 13.9k u would of made more then 300%, could of even sold at 10k and still made a killing compared to 15%

[26-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
> 15% a year is not much

[26-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
nigga wha

[26-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
its not

[26-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
If u cant do more than 15% in 1 year financial market might not be for u

[26-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253
lmao nigga you lend a crypto

[26-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Tek#5253
I don't want my btc stuck and only optoin to pay like 300 bux to be able to move it back on exchange to sell that crap

[26-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Tek#5253
if BTC core doesn't do a block size increase its gonna die

[26-Aug-19 06:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181

More than 2,000 people have signed an online petition calling on Ripple to stop issuing so many of its XRP tokens, which they believe is behind the cryptocurrency's poor price performance since the end of June.

[26-Aug-19 07:23 PM] Markus#5464
If u know what ur doing it doesnt matter

[26-Aug-19 07:24 PM] Markus#5464
Doesnt require much effort to grow ur crypto bags either

[26-Aug-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
@Tek fees haven't been anywhere near $50 for a very long time now

[26-Aug-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
almost 2 years

[26-Aug-19 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
I get what you're saying, but it's unbelievably stupid to leave any coins on an exchange long term

[26-Aug-19 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
especially if the justification for it is "I don't want to pay $.10 to move it"

[26-Aug-19 08:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
512MB blocks is just asking for a network split

[26-Aug-19 08:53 PM] scubapanda#2485
Well, you could leave USDT there - not much better holding it in your wallet? :troll:

@Alexfrog Should K64 turn out to be a scam, it will be arguably one of the poorest executed scams in crypto. I have a bag so I'm more or less just sitting back and watching this trainwreck unfold. As much as I'd love to average down, I'm not throwing good capital after bad

[27-Aug-19 12:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
agreed

[27-Aug-19 12:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i also have a bag üò¶

[27-Aug-19 12:01 AM] Alexfrog#1338
we'll see

[27-Aug-19 12:01 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ive written it off mentally

[27-Aug-19 12:01 AM] bishop#9773
At the low point after their "we'll release major news" bullshit, I think I was sitting on close to a 25k KMD unrealized loss

Still have my bags too fwiw

[27-Aug-19 02:04 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
@Hollowman9000 its especially funny bc they had started all that stuff about "no more premature announcements, when it happens it happens"

[27-Aug-19 02:04 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so much for that

[27-Aug-19 02:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
