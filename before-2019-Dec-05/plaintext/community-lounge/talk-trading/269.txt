seems to me some miners could switch from BTC to BCH tmp as price spikes, but can go down when price go down

[11-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@blackjok3r what would happen if you upload a shitload of data into it, nodes would see their data explode?

[11-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it would, but it woul get expesive very fast

[11-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You would need lots of BCH to keep sending it

[11-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm also true, could you upload stuff to chains that dont have tx fees like eos?

[11-Nov-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if they have an OP_RETURN ...

[11-Nov-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if they do you can ... that said, my streamer would have a hard time, getting the data back out of chain that is not a specifc streamer chain. I made a lot of assumptions and then enforced them as rules in the chain so that it would work... it was hte only way to amke it go fast enough.

[11-Nov-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
even bitcoin has opreturn, but only 40 bytes

[11-Nov-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but you can encode data in vout scripts

[11-Nov-18 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
push data, push data, push data, ... it does increase the cost though

[11-Nov-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That seems to be the limiting factor, cost .... you could push data into BTC but it woould be very stupid.

[11-Nov-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking to do it more to show BCH people what can be done...
