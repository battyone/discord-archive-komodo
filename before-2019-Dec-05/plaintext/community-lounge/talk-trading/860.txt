or a fiat bot algorithmic setting of price

[26-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Markus#5464
funny to see how every single alt is heavily rekt vs btc

[26-Jun-19 05:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
traders will see their atmospheric btc returns start to dwindle, then they will jump into alts. it's fairly predictable. and alts start popping off like bottle rockets. it is coming

keep calm and buy alts

[26-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810

LTC is rekt bigtime vs btc but it will probably make a explosive burst soon considering halvening

[26-Jun-19 05:43 PM] dan.#2473
Good points. I agree. But what is concerning is the btc rally probably got ways to go.

[26-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as fiat pegs are holding, it is just more money flowing into the resorvoir

[26-Jun-19 05:43 PM] Caglio#3337
@Markus Ltc always follows btc, at least it did, I am pretty sure its gonna hit over 200$ soon

[26-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810

Whales and people who run the show will not allow alts to capitulise.. theres just too much fortune they can make with all crypto...
There should be no fear.

[26-Jun-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the whales make money with all the big market moves, and pushing alts down is a critical part of the money machine

[26-Jun-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
just like they loaded up on BTC during the bear, they will do the same for alts. just wait for the sideways moving of BTC, or even a little correction

[26-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Caglio#3337

with all these crypto purists in here im not sure anyone cares about stocks...but RIOT (+15.1%) OSTK (+24%) DPW (+32%) MGTI(+45%) among blockchain names led higher by the 18.4% rally in bitcoin today. when the BTC rally stalls these will come crashing down much harder than BTC

For those interested in the lesser known or forgotten aspects of technical analysis, in point & figure terms $BTCUSD is on a "high pole".

After the $BTC gaps and parabolic run in late 2017 there was another gap with a doji the same day....i wonder what the high candle formation of 2019 will be for #bitcoin after the recent gaps and similar parabolic run. #risk #riskmanagement
