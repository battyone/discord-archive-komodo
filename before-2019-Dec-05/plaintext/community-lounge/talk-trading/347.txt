I'm not following Waves closely, even if in size it's my 2nd bag after Komodo. I completely missed the Vostok news

https://t.co/2SqTPaGOO2 #Vostok, a one billion dollar project in #Waves ecosystem, has closed the first funding round. 3% of VST system tokens will be airdropped to $Waves holders. Waves is becoming the first #WEB3 company with a versatile product pipeline.

thanks! even though KMD is missing out on these gains, i still think it's a good thing to see some 50% + gains in the space

[19-Dec-18 12:56 PM] Malti#3948
just for general opinion about crypto

[19-Dec-18 12:56 PM] dokrates#8987
we also need +50% on kmd

[19-Dec-18 12:56 PM] Malti#3948
we all need 50% gainz of course

[19-Dec-18 12:57 PM] Malti#3948
but I mean, some nice stories about people doubling their money in short amounts of time is not bad for the markets in general!

[19-Dec-18 12:57 PM] dokrates#8987
yes

[19-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Lumbi#8378
bull markets get devs into morocco and out of code

[19-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Malti#3948
except for KMD

[19-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Malti#3948
so generating a bull market with marketing endorsed projects is a good thing to get people into the space

[19-Dec-18 01:00 PM] dokrates#8987
maybe some of the profits from waves and stratis comes to komodo

[19-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Malti#3948
then KMD's superior tech will grab more attention and boom

[19-Dec-18 01:01 PM] Malti#3948
that I doubt, when similar projects pamp, the supporters tend to think their project in their niche is 'the chosen one'

[19-Dec-18 01:01 PM] Malti#3948
and will be the winner in the niche

[19-Dec-18 01:02 PM] dokrates#8987

I'm just reshuffling my portfolio to projects that could appeal to the institutional investors

[19-Dec-18 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
BTC - ETH - ADA - XRP (fuck it) - IOTA (fuck it^2) - KMD (as true believer)

[19-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Malti what's to like about ADA üòâ

[19-Dec-18 01:19 PM] Malti#3948
haha i'm actually only really going in depths of KMD tech tbh

[19-Dec-18 01:19 PM] Malti#3948
but I think that projects like these will appeal to the institutional investors cuz it looks well built and so on

[19-Dec-18 01:20 PM] Lumbi#8378

[19-Dec-18 01:21 PM] Lumbi#8378

[19-Dec-18 01:44 PM] dokrates#8987
gonna buy all

[19-Dec-18 02:06 PM] Vertigo#0439
It looks weak compared to the rest...

[19-Dec-18 02:06 PM] Vertigo#0439
Come one 25%

[19-Dec-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
better to have a solid 25%, than a 50% that drops to 25%

[19-Dec-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not saying that will happen, but if you watch the ones that go up the most, a lot of them will drop down

[19-Dec-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and any gain against BTC when BTC is up 10% is a good day

[19-Dec-18 02:19 PM] Malti#3948
true that JL777c, those massive pamps are actually only good fo rday traders

[19-Dec-18 02:20 PM] actionslacks#4072

[19-Dec-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is good KMD is not a target of P+D groups (usually), just some hungry whales

[19-Dec-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and actually KMD is the 20th biggest percentage gainer out of 100. that seems not so bad

[19-Dec-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
very few people have WAVES + STRATIS + MONA to get the top 3 gainers all with over 40%

No need to stress over your favorite project not pumping.  Some project is pumping on nearly any given day.  If you bought because of fundamentals and those have either not changed, or have improved, you should have no worries.

```Rebranding
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Rebranding is a marketing strategy in which a new name, term, symbol, design, or combination thereof is created for an established brand with the intention of developing a new, differentiated identity in the minds of consumers, investors, competitors, and other stakeholders.```

[19-Dec-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
"marketing strategy" is an ongoing process, not just a matter to change logo

[19-Dec-18 05:50 PM] üõ°bstr156#5540
Yeah, "rebrand" usually ecompasses quite a bit as brand is more than website and logo...  a brand is the overall perception being promoted.

[19-Dec-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
from what I gather, it basically means everything

[19-Dec-18 05:54 PM] üõ°bstr156#5540
Timing is good for this while the market seems to be working through (or out of) a trough.  Shows the project is alive and well.
