He's got his own server and it's certainly worth a watch if you're into these things!

Hi fishy ( : ❤

[26-Mar-19 04:08 PM] LocoMB#8593
what is that rather colourful discord all about?

[26-Mar-19 04:09 PM] Caglio#3337
I hope its pump and dump

[26-Mar-19 04:09 PM] Caglio#3337
I need money for scheming

[26-Mar-19 04:10 PM] LocoMB#8593
reminds me of those red light districts in SciFi movies- kinda cool, but I am really not sure if I'd like to take recommendations there... at least not uncorroborated ones.. 🕵

Ok gonna buy some more

[26-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Just to be able to stay on discord server and chat with @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[26-Mar-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No need to buy scifi movies, there's no cover charge

[26-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Caglio#3337
too late now, I bought few

[26-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Caglio#3337
you owe me now

[26-Mar-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd rather owe you forever than screw you out of it 🙂

yes. yes, you are

[26-Mar-19 10:47 PM] crumb#2550
@Tek why are you constantly yelling like this? i understand if some rare occasion people express their emotion, but doing this often and without serious reason, this just pollutes the channel/conversation

So much fun certain people are not allowed to go there.

[26-Mar-19 10:56 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Does mm2 allow offline orderbooks?

[26-Mar-19 10:57 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If not is there a way to have a proxy token dex made for people who want to be able to, and it just orderbook matches with barterdex but proxytokwn on users end, with a trusted market maker on bdex end

[26-Mar-19 11:05 PM] crumb#2550
the proxytoken request has been asked before and afaik Komodo's goal is to have a working solution for pure atomic swaps between blockchains

[26-Mar-19 11:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Orderbooks are peer to peer

[26-Mar-19 11:06 PM] crumb#2550
no need to "solve" anything by adding proxy tokens to the mix

[26-Mar-19 11:07 PM] crumb#2550
it is all about solving real problems and not pleasing people short-term

[27-Mar-19 05:40 AM] Caglio#3337
I have a question for all you hackers here

[27-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Caglio#3337
When I check coin market cap, it says komodo total supply is 112,398,292 KMD

[27-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Caglio#3337
While max supply is 200,000,000

[27-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Caglio#3337
So is it still mineable ? or what ? can someone explain it, thanks

[27-Mar-19 05:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes its still minable 3 Block reward 1440 blocks per day 75% to Notarynodes, 25% to the 'public'

[27-Mar-19 05:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
And then there is the 5% rewards per year which also is created/mined

[27-Mar-19 05:49 AM] Caglio#3337
@CHMEX thank you sir

[27-Mar-19 12:14 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I see btc going down. retest 3k support. alts go down along. KMD to previous support at ~23k

[27-Mar-19 12:15 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
also low volume on btc

[27-Mar-19 12:15 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

next target will be 41 ema or upper bb

[27-Mar-19 12:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
weekly scales have much more weight than 4h charts

`btc will drag it down`
every reason I've been calling it a 'stone around our necks'

[27-Mar-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Everything that has BTC as a main base lives and dies with it

Rai stones
The Micronesian island of Yap is known for its stone money, known as Rai, or Fei: large doughnut-shaped, carved  disks of (usually) calcite, up to 4 m (12 ft) in diameter (most are much smaller). The smallest can be as little as 3.5 centimetres (1.4 in) in diameter. Rai, or s...

i dont think BTC is good or bad to have as main leader in market

[27-Mar-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers if there weren't publicity and psychology involved, then I would agree

[27-Mar-19 12:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its not about that... its more about market categories

[27-Mar-19 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You see for example in gold markets that you have gold price as a standard but then you have the whole industry stocks behind it that oscillate with gold price but in a more volatile way sometimes

[27-Mar-19 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
same goes for oil or financials stocks

[27-Mar-19 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or technology stocks

[27-Mar-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
until BTC isnt the largest marketcap crypto, there will be correlation between BTC price and overall crypto prices, due to math

[27-Mar-19 12:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there will always be correlation with all crypto.

after btc stops being a market leader, the market will follow the next leader

[27-Mar-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, but when you peg to any of them you have the same issue
the world goes nuts with "We buy used gold jewelry for top $" fever and the value of everything pegged to gold floats
some dick doesn't like some leader of some small country and starts a 3 decade long crusade and the cost of oil looks  like an oscilloscope measuring highway traffic
while those examples are "no better" than BTC, that doesn't really make the argument for BTC being "neutral"

[27-Mar-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What btc is doesnt matter, actually

[27-Mar-19 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`after btc stops being a market leader, the market will follow the next leader`
That's kind of the whole issue: that currencies have a "leader" 🤷🏽

[27-Mar-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
at this point, market looks to bitcoin as a brand

[27-Mar-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sadly, yes

[27-Mar-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
like Amazon, or Apple, or whatever.

[27-Mar-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC is a commodity

[27-Mar-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@KomodoWorld I emailed that man twice when he first asked but never received a message back. Try a third time with this update but not holding my breath.

[27-Mar-19 01:02 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I didn't get a reply too, we'll see this time

[27-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I did receive a message from a scam account in NXT about a swap. At least I have that going for me.

[27-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I'm not even sure how he plans on doing the swap. It is obvious that just emailing the two address isn't going to work since scammers are already searching the top holders and pretending to be legit.

[27-Mar-19 01:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
my email included a message signed w my nxt keys

[27-Mar-19 01:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
