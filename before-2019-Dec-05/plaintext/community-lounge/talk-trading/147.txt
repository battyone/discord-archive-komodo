it all boils down to this IMO

[11-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also I dont really care for btc

[11-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As I don't really see it becoming more than a store of wealth

[11-Sep-18 04:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But what interests me are alts, because they will display usage

[11-Sep-18 04:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think Komodo shows it's more than a store of wealth

[11-Sep-18 04:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Exactly

[11-Sep-18 04:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If we can see some alts (hopefully kmd will be one of them) actually being used for day to day stuff

[11-Sep-18 04:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Komodo shows that btc is more than a store of wealth

[11-Sep-18 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only THEN we will see the industry moving away from traditional banking

[11-Sep-18 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yea for dpow

[11-Sep-18 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But kmd is not tied to btc indefinitely, kmd can switch to whatever has the highest hashrate

[11-Sep-18 04:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
By the numbers of asics out there who else is close to btc hashrate

[11-Sep-18 04:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hell, let's say for argument's sake that kmd becomes the chain with the highest hashrate, will the kmd chain still need dpow to another chain?

[11-Sep-18 04:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or will other chains only dpow to kmd?

[11-Sep-18 04:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think having 3 different security profiles is better than 2.

[11-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm also true

[11-Sep-18 04:57 PM] jspook16#3059
Never!

[11-Sep-18 04:57 PM] snowdamn#2414
stablecoins, countries allowing unlicensed corps to continue operations, regulatory agencies saying crypto is here to stay, etc.

"Bitcoin - New and Improved with Segwit 6.0"

[11-Sep-18 05:02 PM] dan.#2473
I like whatever is the biggest most secure decentralized crypto, could be certainly something else someday because they do seem to make some poor and slow moving decisions. Bitcoin sucks as a currency but great for trustless immutable hash storage. There's value in that

[11-Sep-18 05:04 PM] dan.#2473
Devs know it sucks as currency which is why I think they are trying these off chain solutions, whether that works remains to be seen I guess

[11-Sep-18 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
channels CC has the benefits of LN, without the downside and it is backward compatible with existing infrastructure

My only issue with "off chain solutions" is that they get presented as part of the actual thing and not a distinctly separate thing

[11-Sep-18 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Much in the same manner that people actually believe they posses coinage on a CEX

[11-Sep-18 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c CC is over-rated; I mean who wants contracts and conditions that secure coinage transfers on-chain anyway? What do you think this is? Cryptography or something? :trollface:

[11-Sep-18 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The problem with CC is that there's no way to demonize it in the press and therefore no way to generate meaningless hype.
Sadly, most people seem like they couldn't possibly care less about actual tech, security, or fundamentals  😖

[11-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We make it back to 12k that’s ICO price

[11-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Some garbage alts will be consolidated then

[11-Sep-18 08:30 PM] coinr#7073
Yeah but one shitcoin gone another 2 pop up. Cant fight that sector

[11-Sep-18 08:30 PM] coinr#7073
And as long as people try to swing trade ponzi coins it wont go away.  I wouldnt mind another 2015 type of year, could use it

In my portfolio, I have a few stinkers that have held their own vs KMD

[11-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[11-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And they hold

[11-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

It’s only roughly $3k worth

[11-Sep-18 08:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I want whale to break 15k first

[11-Sep-18 08:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There isn’t much support there

[11-Sep-18 08:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
