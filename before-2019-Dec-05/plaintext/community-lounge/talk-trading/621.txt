tbh, this isnt even about only KMD for me either, if I can learn more and become more skilled elsewhere I will do that... But id rather help this commutnity that helped me if possible. Just seems like the right thing to do.

don't mean to be insensitive but, driving a lambo is a better experience if you're not married

[09-May-19 02:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Actually, Family was part of what stopped my to get deeper into KMD.

[09-May-19 02:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

my relationship was probably already ruined.... tbh

[09-May-19 02:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
on a serious note, family is what pushes me.. regardless of outcome i'll still be there

[09-May-19 02:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Being infront of a computer is kind of anti-family

[09-May-19 02:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is no way to do both imo.

[09-May-19 02:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
i found that having a schedule and alocating time for fam helps

[09-May-19 02:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, and be able to not look at your cellphone when you are with the family is a hard skill to achieve

[09-May-19 02:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
