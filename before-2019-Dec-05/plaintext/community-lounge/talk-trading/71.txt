are coinmarketcap's stats on BarterDex accurate?  If not, how off are they and is there an accurate measurement out there?

[29-Jul-18 01:16 AM] ryman112#0068
Cmc has a lot of gray area but as far as I know without doing a shit ton of research its close as you need to be

[29-Jul-18 01:17 AM] meatspoon#7860

$HKN Token Migration Notes now on Reddit; the Hacken Token will be migrating away from ETH to another blockchain 3.0 project. They will do a token split and introduce masternode  capabilities similar to $VEN / $VET where 1 HKN = 100 HKX.

(1 of 2)

I‚Äôve recently read about your migration away from the ETH platform.  Might I suggest an in-depth review of Komodo ( $kmd)?  Security of BTC hashpower plus the independence of your own chain, with unlimited TPS scaling.

We have groups who specialize...
