does anybody use hotbit.io and have any comments about it? Is it a scam or real exchange?

[17-Feb-19 06:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
If you treat everything other than binance and bittrex as a scam exchange, thats probably safer.

just wondering if anybody has used it, I guess. I trust peeps in here

[17-Feb-19 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
looking to sell something that is only on that exchange. i very rarely use exchanges and don't seek out the "excitement" of vetting ones I have never heard of

[17-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so just do a small amount, test that withdrawal works, and then use it but withdraw after trade and dont store anything there

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] Alexfrog#1338

Damn son

[17-Feb-19 06:36 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[17-Feb-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not a wall, that is 8BTC against 700BTC of volume today

[17-Feb-19 06:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

lower liquidity exchanges got ahead on price because people could spike them up with less btc

[17-Feb-19 06:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nope. But binance didnt seem to be leader in this move

[17-Feb-19 06:42 PM] Markus#5464

[17-Feb-19 07:04 PM] dokrates#8987
why korea buying so much?

[17-Feb-19 07:06 PM] richardt#2807
@siu - Chainmakers I think tech-wise, it's definitely up there or even above.  As far as awareness/usage-wise, not quite there yet, but maybe one day.

[17-Feb-19 07:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
must be all those game dev companies buying up KMD before they announce their latest blockchain games

Imagine wondering why @KomodoPlatform is pumping in volume and gains for the past week, but not looking into it.  

Do yourself a favor and DYOR on this AT LEAST AN HOUR.  
You will NOT be disappointed.  

$KMD is what $ETH always wanted to be, but $BTC compatible.

This volume is insane today

[17-Feb-19 07:29 PM] dokrates#8987
yes

[17-Feb-19 07:29 PM] dokrates#8987
its scary to sell now

[17-Feb-19 07:31 PM] richardt#2807
Wasn't it the Koreans that started buying a bunch of BTC back in early 2017 and initiated the year-long bull run?  Remember reading about that somewhere..

[17-Feb-19 07:33 PM] dokrates#8987
if you look at the weekly candle, its almost the same as the weekly candle before the ultra bullrun

[17-Feb-19 07:36 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea agreed. Except the volume is much higher üòà

[17-Feb-19 07:36 PM] dokrates#8987
yes, also circulating coins are higher

[17-Feb-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
by less than 10%, seems not a big factor

[17-Feb-19 07:47 PM] dokrates#8987
uhmm, interesting

[17-Feb-19 07:48 PM] dokrates#8987
@jl777c what you think about the increase in value? i like steady growth for long

[17-Feb-19 08:00 PM] richardt#2807
The Koreans must know something we don't

[17-Feb-19 08:27 PM] dokrates#8987
uhmmm

[17-Feb-19 08:27 PM] dokrates#8987

doesn't really matter in the big picture. price is a result, not a thing in itself. just keep holding and chill. spend the time learning about tech instead of watching charts. it's highly likely you'll get better ROI out of this
