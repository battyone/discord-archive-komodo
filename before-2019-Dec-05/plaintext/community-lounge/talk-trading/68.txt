[25-Jul-18 07:22 PM] FundazuSafu#1169

I think we need to break 25k to get out of the falling wedge?

[25-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Red candle of doom just needs a few more confirmations

[25-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Once out of the falling wedge december scenario might be possible

[25-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[25-Jul-18 08:07 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Guys, i think i know what caused the KMD pump today..

[25-Jul-18 08:08 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
And that is..

[25-Jul-18 08:08 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
I sold my KMD stash for BTC yesterday

[25-Jul-18 08:10 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
I'm pretty sure that's the reason it pumped today üòÇ

[25-Jul-18 08:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[25-Jul-18 08:15 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
@Cryptoon Yep, i thought BTC was up for a run up (most alts bleed when BTC goes up fast) because of the SEC decision next month, so i sold most of my alts for BTC üòÇ

[25-Jul-18 08:16 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Today the SEC announced they are delaying it until september

[25-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We still need confirmation though

[25-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For kmd

[25-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But generally speaking

[25-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For the first time in a long while

[25-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
People I know are asking me about crypto again

[25-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And how to buy

[25-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If I can sell them some

[25-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Etc

[25-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Should count as an indicator

The day BTC hit $20k, every tard and their buddy was staring at blockfolio on their phones

[25-Jul-18 08:53 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Same as it will hit 50k$

[25-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It was at $15k or $17k that morning

[25-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I told the guy next to me it ‚Äúwould hit $20k today‚Äù

[25-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Shilling bitpanda kmd as much as possible

[25-Jul-18 09:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How many confirmations to send from bitpanda to binance for example?

[25-Jul-18 09:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
One reason ltc pumped so hard last year was because many people used it to move coins from one exchange to another

[25-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We could market kmd as a good way to transfer between bitpanda and trex/binance?

Panda is one confirmation, but if the others are a lot, then it wont make much sense?

[25-Jul-18 09:38 PM] dxer666#8963
140 confirm binance

[25-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm not very practical :p

why Binance dep confirmation is too high?

[26-Jul-18 04:45 AM] yen-cryptolife#8131
Avoid arbitrage?

[26-Jul-18 04:46 AM] yen-cryptolife#8131
or a suspicious view on KMD network security?

[26-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think all equihash coins have that many

[26-Jul-18 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ASIC's ... Until enough ASIC's have been sold that all these chains have large hash rate, they can all be attacked far too easily.

[26-Jul-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Technically... the exchanges could use the API webworker made to check if a notarization happened and then the deposit would be confirmed, but implementing that is up to them. Seems they opted to just increase confirms to some silly amount instead.

[26-Jul-18 06:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think I read it was @ca333 that advised them to increase the necassary confirmations as a precaution?

[26-Jul-18 06:26 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Smells like someone got payed to kill competition.. hmm..

[26-Jul-18 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont know man, i understand the situation

[26-Jul-18 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
With the new miners coming out hashrate can easily double

[26-Jul-18 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So untill we see what the possible outcomes are and how it effects chain security, best not take any chances

[26-Jul-18 06:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Solely chinese bitmain can mine kmd then.

[26-Jul-18 07:06 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I have to think about it..

[26-Jul-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
