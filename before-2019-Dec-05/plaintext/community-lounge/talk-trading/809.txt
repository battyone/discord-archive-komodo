Nobody hardly knows who KMD is

[22-Jun-19 04:48 AM] ryman112#0068
Well they had to spend some good funding on this "rebrand"

[22-Jun-19 04:48 AM] designer#4893
Komodo seems to be too far ahead of his time.
It is not good to go too far ahead of the times.

[22-Jun-19 04:48 AM] ryman112#0068

Usually projects like that fail and the tech comes up later in someone else's hands

[22-Jun-19 04:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
KMD getting dumped cause bots treat every alt like heavy-mined-alt where price should be mostly pegged to USD / mining cost; which makes not sens for KMD since it's 5% apr ...

Incentives are needed for good developers and enterprising people to continue to remain in Komodo.

But the price of Komodo is not attractive.

[22-Jun-19 04:51 AM] ryman112#0068
Dont care about the price or dump.  I wanna know what the hell is going on with marketing.  This very well could be the beginning of the next bull run and we are in the shadows.

Every billion dollar company tech or not advertise their shit before its released or else its a flop.  Look at Nintendo

[22-Jun-19 04:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I  agree. @ryman112   ,    There needs to be made some major changes

[22-Jun-19 04:54 AM] richardt#2807
@ryman112 I think the answer is the rebrand didn't pan out like they hoped.  Ideas by Nature probably took a look at the project and thought "wth is this?" and gave up shortly thereafter 😄

Alot can be learned from any company that ever marketed anything

[22-Jun-19 05:02 AM] Mark81#4505
I think Linus Torvalds didn't do much marketing either.

[22-Jun-19 05:05 AM] Mark81#4505
If price would go 10x from here i think then problem would be too high price to accumulate.

[22-Jun-19 05:05 AM] richardt#2807
I think price could go 10x from here, but likely only because it's the rest of the crypto market that goes up

[22-Jun-19 05:05 AM] ryman112#0068
@Mark81 The guy wrote a damn book

[22-Jun-19 05:06 AM] ryman112#0068
Thats marketing

It's an open organization of individuals. All ideas are welcome. efforts even more so. the only comparable platform that can launch it's own independent sub projects on their own blockchains would be who?

Linux was started at 1991. Book came out 2001.

[22-Jun-19 05:09 AM] ryman112#0068
Correct but he posted in groups and let everyone he could know about it.  And in 2001 he wrote a book.  Now in 2001 shit was still early for that kinda stuff

Hello everybody out there using minix -
I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)
PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.

just saying "more marketing" is kind of vague.

Jl isnt in charge of marketing.  This rebranding was supposed to be it.  Yet we wait in the shadows

[22-Jun-19 05:13 AM] Mark81#4505
That is marketing during 90s.

[22-Jun-19 05:13 AM] richardt#2807
Honestly, if Jl777 tried to pull a Craig Wright, more people would probably believe he is actually satoshi 😄

if you want to see a coin without marketing, look at namecoin, counterparty, blackcoin, etc. all used to be top 50 or even top 20 coins

[22-Jun-19 06:39 AM] CoinKing88#1540
lol mr. sourpants

[22-Jun-19 06:40 AM] CoinKing88#1540
every alt is heavily down last week,

[22-Jun-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
dont forget that we have now all these ICO tokens in the CMC, that are not coins, and shouldnt really be in COINmarketcap

[22-Jun-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is actually in the upperhalf of alts on binance against BTC now

[22-Jun-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
that means better than the majority, even as it goes below ICO price

[22-Jun-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so now all those that wish they bought at ICO price (in BTC) can

what was ICO price?

[22-Jun-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
10000 to 13000 sats, depending on when during the ico you bought

[22-Jun-19 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
12.9k sats, but btc was like 1000$ or so

[22-Jun-19 06:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I remember someone said when KMD will have smart contract it'll have the potential to reach $100

[22-Jun-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but 80% of coins were via BTCD swap

[22-Jun-19 06:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
let's see where we reach this bull market 😄

[22-Jun-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
in USD was around 10 cents

[22-Jun-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
8 to 10 cents
