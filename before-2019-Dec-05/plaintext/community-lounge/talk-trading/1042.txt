Altcoins aren't dead. They're only sleeping.

its like right on the line

[07-Aug-19 07:33 PM] Markus#5464
bounce incoming?!

[07-Aug-19 07:33 PM] Lanii#8302
What if support breaks :troll:

[07-Aug-19 07:34 PM] Markus#5464
quite heavy support line

[07-Aug-19 07:34 PM] Markus#5464
since mid 2014

[07-Aug-19 07:34 PM] Markus#5464
should not break easily

[07-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Lanii#8302
no it should not

[07-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Lanii#8302
not on first test

[07-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Markus#5464
and tbh it would just make sense to bounce up from it cause btc cant stay dominant forever

[07-Aug-19 07:36 PM] Markus#5464
But we will see üòÉ

[07-Aug-19 07:37 PM] Lanii#8302
Things like "it makes sense and it has to do a specific thing or not" is kinda meh

[07-Aug-19 07:37 PM] Caglio#3337

Whats the point of hanging on a trading chat and bashing TA buddy?

[07-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
I expect to be paid

[07-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
I am on work, its kinda boring

[07-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
So I visited my friend and family @ komodo #talk-trading channel

[07-Aug-19 07:43 PM] dan.#2473
@Lanii @Markus interesting. I was about to ask if TA for alt market cap is even a relevant thing, but, that looks pretty convincing that it is.

[07-Aug-19 07:43 PM] Lanii#8302
I was thinking the same at first but looks decent to me aswell

[07-Aug-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337
Lanii, am I allowed to be here now when I explained myself to you, kind sir ?

[07-Aug-19 07:44 PM] Lanii#8302
ofc you are but Im just gonna block you =/

[07-Aug-19 07:45 PM] dan.#2473
i dont quite understand the y axis, it seems log but its like, different sizes? maybe this is misleading

[07-Aug-19 07:46 PM] dan.#2473
something is not right with the y axis or am i crazy

[07-Aug-19 07:49 PM] Lanii#8302
No I think its proper

[07-Aug-19 07:49 PM] Lanii#8302

[07-Aug-19 07:50 PM] dan.#2473

[07-Aug-19 07:55 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Equalizer is done for

[07-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
How do you mean done ?

[07-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
That means we wont be able to build houses in zimbabwe using the coin ?

[07-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Shit, how is that possible

[07-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
First we lost that amazing party project

[07-Aug-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337
I forgot the name, but you know, the one where you can visit lovely country of Myanmmar, and pay to watch local pop star with a coin

[07-Aug-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Aug-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Aug-19 08:02 PM] dan.#2473

I would like to make a postal office coin

[07-Aug-19 08:03 PM] Caglio#3337
Postal office in Croatia is a total mess

[07-Aug-19 08:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Would be amazing if there is a coin involved, so we make even more mess to the ladies working there

[07-Aug-19 08:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[07-Aug-19 08:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[07-Aug-19 08:04 PM] Caglio#3337
They are already messed up, but I still leave the postal office after 30-45 minutes

[07-Aug-19 08:04 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It's just another project in the ecosystem

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Caglio#3337
But I like that mentality of people there

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Markus#5464

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] scytale#8488

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Caglio#3337
they like to enjoy life, instead working, they dont suck up to tourists lik eother parts do

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Caglio#3337
If you go down there and ask for trouble , you will get it

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
No, equalizer is done for. It is gone.

[07-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Caglio#3337

in dalmatia, they often beat up a) english tourists

[07-Aug-19 08:08 PM] Caglio#3337
b) american marines that think they are ninjas

[07-Aug-19 08:08 PM] Caglio#3337
