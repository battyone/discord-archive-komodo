I think kmd has the ability to replace ETH

[18-Jun-18 07:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
definitely, especially if sharding and plasma result in a dud

[18-Jun-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> It is a formidable adversary

[18-Jun-18 07:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I bet within 4 years after CC are mainnet

[18-Jun-18 07:28 PM] BlackJesus#6161
What they still haven't explained is how they plan to secure these shards.

[18-Jun-18 07:28 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Which is by far the biggest problem.

[18-Jun-18 07:29 PM] BlackJesus#6161
dPoW's cross useability has honestly blown my mind, it feels like every couple of months dPoW goes "Bonus"

[18-Jun-18 07:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
they're trying to bolt scalability on a moving train, Komodo has been built from the ground up for scalability

[18-Jun-18 07:31 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, the designing of KMD is by far superior to ETH's.

[18-Jun-18 07:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
except for ICO usage, there is hardly any Dapp using Eth, some cryptokitties were bringing it to a halt. Not sure how others will fare better

[18-Jun-18 07:32 PM] BlackJesus#6161
KMD is built like a true platform with unlimited scaling due to everything being parallel. Whereas ETH is an upside down pyramid everything's innate reliance on the ETH chain is  a crippling design flaw.

[18-Jun-18 07:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
maybe their solutions will work and Eth will continue to thrive

[18-Jun-18 07:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but certainly Komodo will find its place

[18-Jun-18 07:36 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Perhaps, I can see komodo though being the crux to freeing people of the tyranny of centralized governments in general. A new generation of nomads. This is just me free thinking though, it'll be a fun ride.

[slack] <tolken> I was way off on the Salt Lending timetable but i still think lending is going to be a huge thing in the crypto space. ethLend seems to be fairly decentralized and to me represents one of the most impressive uses of blockchain/smart contracts.

[slack] <bitcoinuserx> Where as in us and other (relatively) free government, they dont really feel the need to use it

[19-Jun-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763

1/ No coin is fully decentralized yet, but some, like bitcoin are ‚Äúon the path to decentralization.‚Äù I was very bullish on EOS because I respect Dan Larimer and the team, however this is shameful. I am putting EOS in the same category as Ripple. https://t.co/ia9pYwlykC
