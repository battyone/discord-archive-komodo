jokes aside, if you're buying for the sole purpose of trading, I see nothing wrong with most coins
if you're asking as a currency, 游뱍

[26-Mar-19 11:52 AM] Caglio#3337
true

[26-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Caglio#3337
however

[26-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Caglio#3337
i see ltc is actually used

[26-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Caglio#3337
After all they are even sponsors of UFC and Glory kickboxing

[26-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Caglio#3337

[26-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Caglio#3337

A golden dog turd with a Budweiser logo is still a dog turd

[26-Mar-19 11:54 AM] Keppie#5156
It's a currency. It has a big brother with the same roots. But don't try to compare LTC to KMD. Apples & oranges ..

U are in crypto for technology

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
And you call ltc a budweisser logo turd

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Tek#5253
cause it is

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
When LTC as a shitty copy succeeded smt

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
that most coins want to ?

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
we would all jerk off each other

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
if kmd did the same

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
why such hate ?

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
you can tell me how superior kmd is, but that utter bullshit cos its not adopted

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
and probably never will be

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Caglio#3337
just barking at the moon

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Tek#5253
heh

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Tek#5253
you clearly haven't been following any news

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Tek#5253
kmd is innovating

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Tek#5253
ltc is coyping

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Tek#5253
copying

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Caglio#3337
And still

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Keppie#5156
You remind me of my little cousin hehe. Screaming as loud as he can

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Caglio#3337
Ltc is more used ?

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Tek#5253
ltc is a copy btc with nothing extra

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s not about use or comparing coins

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Caglio#3337
Huawei is cool phone right ?

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Caglio#3337
Iphone and Samsung still beat him up

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
Who gives a fuck about huawei ?

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Keppie#5156
Actually they don't

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
Noone

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Tek#5253

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Keppie#5156
Lol, check how huawei is doing, They are doing alrite

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`U are in crypto for technology` \* and utility
any currency is worth exactly as much as 2 people decide the value is; to me, markets aside, ltc has about the same exchange value as TIT

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Tek#5253
but ltc

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Tek#5253
straight up copy from btc

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
Keppie I even have a huawei phone

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Tek#5253
ltc is the BTC testnet

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
But thats not the point

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
The coin is actually used and adopted by many

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
We are light years from that

[26-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
just don t base yourself on marketing and check what coins want to do, to offer, what makes em unique. KMD has that DNA, LTC doesn't. It's not about price. not at all.

[26-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Tek#5253
you should be glad for an opportunity to buy a great project thats below the radar

[26-Mar-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Caglio that lemmings think ltc is good because it has LN garbage doesn't make it a good thing
plenty of people found MySpace popular, once upon a time

[26-Mar-19 11:59 AM] Caglio#3337
@Deleted User agree with that

[26-Mar-19 11:59 AM] Caglio#3337

I just put my assets where my hearth is. :D

[26-Mar-19 12:01 PM] Tek#5253
I also don't have any single buttcoin

[26-Mar-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
LTC was one of the first altcoins

[26-Mar-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
that gives is a giant advantage over the other coins as far as distribution goes

[26-Mar-19 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[26-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Caglio#3337
I remember there were a lot of coins at the start

[26-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Caglio#3337
ltc survived that

[26-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Caglio#3337
while many others didnt

[26-Mar-19 12:02 PM] Caglio#3337
and its pretty adopted

"a lot" of coins when LTC started?

[26-Mar-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
really?

[26-Mar-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
what is this giant list of coins

[26-Mar-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
LOL there's no part of that which is about belief, more of the fact that it costs 12 cents a year to stake it 游땥

[26-Mar-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
LTC got onto coinbase, it was the lowest cost coin for the most part the only non-BTC

[26-Mar-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if you say that is not any advantage, then we dont agree on what the word "advantage" means

[26-Mar-19 12:04 PM] Caglio#3337
I never said a giant list of coins

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Caglio yes I absolutely don t say you re wrong about ltc. more history etc... but that was... like first era : old dinausors fighti'g each other, then we saw the crazy start of everything. now the space is not like X years ago. No matter if LTC is historically here, if some coin gain use over huge platforms it can just change the market. yet to see.

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
"I remember there were a lot of coins at the start"

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
Just chek how many from 2011 have survived

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
maybe 2 or 3 ?

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
and there were at least 20-30 different ones

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there were not many coins in 2011

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] Caglio#3337
while today every shit coin survive

[26-Mar-19 12:06 PM] Caglio#3337
well if there were 30 ?

[26-Mar-19 12:06 PM] Caglio#3337
and 2 or 3 survived ?

[26-Mar-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i would like this list of 30 coins from 2011

[26-Mar-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
