I had the impression they're indeed doing  something like Oracle CC for Ethereum, but the real world data part is blockchain agnostic and usable by other projects

[23-Jan-19 06:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
"Chainlink is Blockchain Agnostic; Sell Directly to Every Network. Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger, and other leading blockchains are supported."

[23-Jan-19 06:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems they have good tech and it's open-sourced.
It's a platform (Ethereum) usage project while Komodo is a platform itself.
 Just wonder maybe they will want to use Komodo platform when check how cool is OraclesCC

[23-Jan-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC implements a data market, so by adding some REST api on top of it, can do the same

[23-Jan-19 06:11 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yeah reading further, they provide the tools to become data provider and to feed the data to different blockchains. Komodo could do the same

[23-Jan-19 06:11 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
KomodoLink :trollface:

[23-Jan-19 06:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Some standardised oracles data protocol, API enpoints and GUI/CLI tools would be great yeah

ETF is giving your priv keys to banksters

[23-Jan-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
worse

[23-Jan-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it allows wall street to manipulate bitcoin indirectly

[23-Jan-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
remember the banks can just create arbitrary amounts of fiat out of thin air

[23-Jan-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and then use that to buy/sell any amount of ETF

[23-Jan-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and since it just circulates within wall street, then who knows how much of the money is real.

[23-Jan-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is now, at least they need to deposit funds in CEX to buy the BTC so they can dump it later

[23-Jan-19 08:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
That is true yes and buying a crypto ETF would be like buying Gold ETF you dont hold the real deal and if it goes bad you are the first to loose.

[24-Jan-19 12:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
should be somebody linked to binance I guess or maybe he / she donated 1m in KMD to them 😃

death penalty worldwide for possession :abusedsmily: and people will pay to get rid of ?

[24-Jan-19 12:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CHMEX could it also be that the 'whalebro' address is just another binance cold wallet?

[24-Jan-19 12:54 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes I did speculate about that a while ago by definition it is not cold when you touch it. But sure sounds like.
Also CZ announced once they will have new "cold" wallets and send small transactions to it to test. there is a tweet someplace. That happened to this address....
So who knows.

[24-Jan-19 01:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 what happens to the price of things that are made illegal?  If governments decide to outlaw weed/meth/coke, does the price go up or down?  When governments outlaw short-barreled rifles or shotties, what happens to price?  In short, governments making things illegal ALWAYS inflates their value.

[24-Jan-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
alcohol prohibition in the USA has a lot of fascinating lessons in that regard

[24-Jan-19 01:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yup. I was gonna add that one to the list

[24-Jan-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
in many places, organized crime lobbied for alcohol to be illegal, so they could make much more money from it

[24-Jan-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If governments decide to outlaw weed/meth/coke, does the price go up or down?`

[24-Jan-19 02:07 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
there is difference between "making sth illegal" and "making death penalty for possession", especially when you are able to track "possession" which can be harder for material goodies, can however be easier for BTC? Are you able to actually track BTC user or not  (if you really want to)?

maybe on current level tech it can

[24-Jan-19 02:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but it's a niche, and when a niche goes mainstream gov will infiltrate it or destroy

[24-Jan-19 02:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
