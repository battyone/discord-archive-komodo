`my understanding is the DMT trip is as intense as it gets, seeming to last a very long time but in reality only lasting a few minutes.` <--- This is correct üòÉ

[25-Mar-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
smoking it... but I dont think thats the proper way to do it tbh ...

[25-Mar-19 08:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
whats the proper way?

[25-Mar-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dunno. really isnt it normally done as a drink ... guess thats ayhawaska though maybe diffrent thing altogether

[25-Mar-19 08:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
I was told it came from a frog. And it wasn't cheap. but completely worth it.

[25-Mar-19 08:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
way more effective than conventional therapy for me at least

In the clinical trials described in the book they administered in by IV.  DMT is everywhere, in plants and animals.  Synthesizing it is difficult though.  Our pineal gland, a vestigial third eye located in the center of our brain is thought to release spurts of DMT during REM sleep, birth and near death experiences.  One of the theories is that it allows for the soul to enter/exit the body which is why we see it released in quantity during birth and near death experiences.

[25-Mar-19 08:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Doubt it

[25-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Glands are controlled by the hypothalamus I think, not possible to actively control that one?

$KMD 3D TF-

Aside from having a nice chart that is in an uptrend, fundamentally speaking Komodo is one of the strongest in this space and imo a must have for an investors portfolio for the upcoming bull market.

[25-Mar-19 10:39 AM] Buddz1993#5380

[25-Mar-19 10:39 AM] Buddz1993#5380

Nah its perfect. We are testing our new trendline now

[25-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Markus#5464
Will be interesting to see if it will hold, if we look at macd on daily then its just accelerating more red

[25-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Markus#5464
Probably will find support from 21ma on daily

[25-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully

[25-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Keppie#5156
Selling volume is super low. Let's just close the daily on the trendline and see from there

[25-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Markus#5464
last time we went from 25.5 to 28.5

[25-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Markus#5464
but didnt hold

[25-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Markus#5464
might get something similar

[25-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Keppie#5156
Check $kmd tag on twitter. Ppl are shilling kmd again now that we are/close to trendline

[25-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Keppie#5156
And let's just not forget that Komodo is a solid product

[25-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Markus#5464
The day we cleared all previous resistances and levels will be interesting

[25-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
will be interesting to see what kmd price would be if btc would be 100k like ppl say is possible

[25-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
i assume 100$+

[25-Mar-19 01:19 PM] Keppie#5156
Eazy on the moontalk @Markus  üòÑ

[25-Mar-19 01:19 PM] Keppie#5156
lets start with 5k btc üòÑ

[25-Mar-19 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think a lot of people want to see a big btc move first

[25-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Markus#5464
haha just thinking but i quess its hard to predict

[25-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah any way btc will move alts will move as well

[25-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
btc pump to 5k -> alts dump at first, follow after

[25-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
btc dump to 3k -> alts dump as well

[25-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So only if btc stays the same I can see kmd move up consistently

[25-Mar-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
think in terms of overall crypto marketcap

[25-Mar-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
current less than 0.1%, goal of 1%

[25-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Next bullrun kmd is a contender for top 20 / Top 10 for sure

[25-Mar-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337

20% discount if your order is over 10k kmd

[25-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Solid offer!

[25-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm selling KMD @ 20USD ea, but 50% discount if you order over 10k kmd!

[25-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so you get more discount from me

[25-Mar-19 01:35 PM] Keppie#5156
You know what scares me

moon moon moon, all it does

[25-Mar-19 01:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they have built a good model  for a continued pump

[25-Mar-19 01:40 PM] Keppie#5156
Remember when Binance was just a very small exchange. I used to buy some shitty erc20 tokens on it

[25-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Keppie#5156
And bought myself some bnb with it

[25-Mar-19 01:41 PM] modereck#4269
until someone hack binance xD

[25-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Keppie#5156
yea, where do you store bnb

[25-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Keppie#5156
only on the exchange right ?

[25-Mar-19 01:42 PM] modereck#4269
Im 100% on kmd

[25-Mar-19 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
BNB is just an ERC20 coin, so I assume it can also be stored on ledger/mew etc

Bitcoin has traditionally starting pumping around 1 year on average before it's halving date

The next halving is estimated to be May 2020, meaning that the uptrend will begin in May of this year..
