According to the Bitmain pre-IPO investor deck, they sold most of their #Bitcoin for #Bcash. At $900/BCH, they've bled half a billion in the last 3 months. If Bitcoin Core devs didn't disclose the Bcash vulnerability, it could've wiped a billion dollars off their balance s...

So that means the what now?

[12-Aug-18 11:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
bitmain took a hefty loss

[12-Aug-18 11:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And probably supported the bch price as well

[12-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Bowdo#4054
So is this vulnerability thing just fud?  Bch mob don't seem to think there is an issue by the looks.  Hard to tell what is what with all the hyperbole and vitriol

bcash is the problem :trollface:

[12-Aug-18 12:26 PM] snowdamn#2414

On a sidenote does anyone have a cat?

Just got myself a kitten, given him 2 litter trays

[12-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
and all he seems to do is piss or shit right outside it

[12-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Legit 1cm outside the box, but he will piss and shit in the box if i pick him up and put him in it

[12-Aug-18 12:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Its like his mocking me. I've tried clicker training, but seems like this 6 week old kitty is playing smart by pretending to use the litter box, fake pissing and burying it, only to come out to eat my treat 🙃

[12-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have 3

[12-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
keep putting them in the box when its doing its thing

[12-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if not doing it in the box

[12-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they should pick up on it quite fast

I'm still going to hold my poisition in "bcash" over BTC. I don't think the most successful bitcoin entrepeneurs would be wrong about moving their stakes from BTC to BCH together.

[12-Aug-18 01:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
when bitpay drops BTC support alot of people are going to shit their pants :/. It will happen, believe me.

Only positions I hold are komodo and BCH

[12-Aug-18 01:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I prefer BCH too

[12-Aug-18 01:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
that is both BTC & BCH have their own issues, but at least BCH has a plan

BTC is betting it all on LN that is a dead end IMO, I don't know any plan B

[12-Aug-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think that once the smoke clears and people realize the LN is more of an enterprise solution that is highly useless for the average BTC user, there will be a lot of change in the entire space

We don't list shitcoins even if they pay 400 or 4,000 BTC. ETH/NEO/XRP/EOS/XMR/LTC/more listed with no fee. Question is not “how much does Binance charge to list?” but “is my coin good enough?”  It’s not the fee, it's your project!  Focus on your own project!
