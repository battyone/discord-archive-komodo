nothing else

[30-May-19 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD is much much better choice if have to only buy something today.

[30-May-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just coz I was one of the first ICO participant, I did not buy any IOTA

[30-May-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm only holding tiny bit of what is left of after selling major part of what I got from that ICO

[30-May-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
did not buy a single IOTA off the market.

[30-May-19 09:35 AM] LocoMB#8593
@klein IOTA is a completely different tech than blockchains - it is like difference between an aircrafft carrier and submarine..
but you are right about the uninformed part and the steaming pile of shit :troll_cool:
or nuclear fission and fusion ‚ò¢

do they still go down when someone tries to charge their phone and unplugs the servers?!

@LocoMB  I just remember hearing the project had lots of problems

[30-May-19 09:46 AM] LocoMB#8593
yaaaaa... these were really vicisous smear campaigns

[30-May-19 09:47 AM] LocoMB#8593
the problems that did exist were much smaller than the attackers tried to paint them as

[30-May-19 09:48 AM] LocoMB#8593
lies, falsehoods decpetions- that is what certain interests used in their attempts to harm the project

[30-May-19 09:49 AM] LocoMB#8593
and Yes, Dorothy, there are also lots of corrupt fuckers in the academic world, pompous titles and all notwithstanding üêó  üí∞

[30-May-19 09:58 AM] klein#5233
Regardless of whether IOTA is a steaming pile of shit or genuinely pushing the boundaries of innovation, if Supernet is going to be a komodo based asset it should not hold IOTA

[30-May-19 09:59 AM] klein#5233
whether its going to zero or going to mars should NOT be any basis or judgement to hold IOTA in Supernet

[30-May-19 10:00 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the iota pump is because they found a way to remove the coordinator, that was one of the main criticisms

I've now had the chance to speak about the new proposal with the inventor. Since there are no fees, stake or block rewards in this DPoS proposal, it is also entirely insecure. Read this thread to learn about their broken game-theory reasoning. https://t.co/wXnvQtxyD2

I don't understand enough to say if it will work or not

@klein SuperNET predates KMD

[30-May-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not mandated to be only for KMD ecosystem

[30-May-19 10:03 AM] klein#5233
Yes I realise

[30-May-19 10:03 AM] klein#5233
But my impression was that for it to become a KMD ecosystem asset?

[30-May-19 10:03 AM] klein#5233
Am I wrong?

[30-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the largest holder of KMD

[30-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an important part of the ecosystem

[30-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
but it has no "must divest if not KMD ecosystem" mandate

[30-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
so i will not take that into account

[30-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i will do it if it makes sense to do

[30-May-19 10:05 AM] klein#5233
So its not going to "become" a komodo ecosystem asset?

[30-May-19 10:05 AM] klein#5233
soley

[30-May-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo does not force anybody to become KMD exclusive

[30-May-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
why should it do that to SuperNET? which is in a way its parent

[30-May-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
that being said, I would indeed be willing to swap IOTA for KMD

[30-May-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just easier said than done

[30-May-19 10:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@klein treat SuperNET asset like a Berkshire Corporation. Just to imagine it as a coroporation, who just invests in companies while they are small, and have possibly big future increasing their value.
It all depends on the evaluator of the SuperNET asset manager who manages it's funds value and diversify it's portfolio to what class of assets and to what kind of assets in that class.
From that understanding I understand that SuperNET is NOT only strictly locked to ONLY Komodo Platform Ecosystem.
In my opinion it'd not be ideal to ONLY stick with KMD. The value of the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem is the ideal choice to be in.
And in case if it can have somehow reach it's target holdings, it's best for all the SuperNET holders.

[30-May-19 10:10 AM] klein#5233
Are they any investment rules for Supernet or is it purely discretionary

[30-May-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
purely discretionary

[30-May-19 10:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
From early days of NXT, this SuperNET asset diversified it's value to some potential cryptocurrency projects.
I guess it might keep doing so if some outside KMD ecosystem project also comes in it's notice. üòÑ

[30-May-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the space is much more difficult now, very crowded and saturated. for new investments it has been limited to the ecosystem projects

[30-May-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but existing investments are not easy to change

[30-May-19 10:13 AM] jorian#4555
can you say SuperNET is an investment fund, run solely by jl777?

[30-May-19 10:13 AM] klein#5233
I'd admit a discretionary fund is interesting

[30-May-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
you can say that, but it does more than pure investing. it helped incubate KMD

[30-May-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
granted by doing that, it helped its biggest holding

[30-May-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it is not apparent yet as the assetchains are not really producing revenues (other than CRYPTO), but it does have significant stakes in all the potential revenue streams

[30-May-19 10:17 AM] klein#5233
I guess I was wrong, some how I thought supernet was going to become more of mandated KMD asset

[30-May-19 10:17 AM] klein#5233
still interesting

[30-May-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the past cannot be undone

[30-May-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it predates KMD by years

[30-May-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it has mostly been KMD-centric in recent years, just track its ecosystem holdings: https://dexstats.info/richlistlookup.php?address=RRyyejME7LRTuvdziWsXkAbSW1fdiohGwK

can you prove the majority of masternodes are not controlled by a single entity?

[30-May-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
when all the masternodes were created, the coin distribution was still very concentrated

[30-May-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so issues like the instamine are actually relevant, even years later

[30-May-19 10:29 AM] Tek#5253

eeek just had a look through my portofolio - 1300% on a buy in arrr
already miss teh dumpers

[30-May-19 10:30 AM] mrlynch#5735
small buy though üò≠

[30-May-19 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
@Tek are you comparing KMD holders to masternodes in Dash?

[30-May-19 10:30 AM] mrlynch#5735
he does love his dash

[30-May-19 10:30 AM] Tek#5253
no man but its stupid to always say "instamine so dash is a scam" shit

[30-May-19 10:32 AM] Tek#5253
Satoshi has 1 million coins from the very start

[30-May-19 10:32 AM] Tek#5253
Ethereum had a huge premine of 70 milllion eth

[30-May-19 10:32 AM] Tek#5253
i mean... if you gonna shit on dash, shit on those facts to

[30-May-19 10:33 AM] mrlynch#5735
there's a difference between mining as per consensus rules (btc, not interested in eth so don't know) and having a few special blocks just for your lonesome

[30-May-19 10:33 AM] LocoMB#8593
lol .. üçπ have some more cool aid dude... bcs _"instamine so dash is a scam" _

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] Tek#5253
whats the differnece if you mine them before anyone knows about the coin

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
besides, those few handfuls of masternodes _are_ controlled by a few shady insiders - in contrast to KMD NN nodes, who do not control the content

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] Tek#5253
there's no difference, when satoj and frens mined in the beginning before telling all the rest what buttcoin is

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] mrlynch#5735
the difference is in the consensus rules

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] jorian#4555
they could tell, but nobody cared

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes, but that is A transparent, and B Satoshi is _poofed_

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] mrlynch#5735
they did tell the world what it was, crypto world was far smaller then that's all

[30-May-19 10:34 AM] jorian#4555
i think we would all have wanted to know about BTC

[30-May-19 10:35 AM] jorian#4555
in 2009

[30-May-19 10:36 AM] klein#5233
nah you don't

[30-May-19 10:36 AM] klein#5233
you would have alot more regrets

[30-May-19 10:36 AM] mrlynch#5735
if i put up a chain rn, post on btt and start mining (because i have to to keep the chain alive) is very different to me putting up a chain with 10% of coins in first 10 or whatever blocks

[30-May-19 10:38 AM] mrlynch#5735
i get that you like <insert coin here> but let's keep it real shall we?!

[30-May-19 10:38 AM] Tek#5253
the results are the same. the creators have vast amounts of coins

[30-May-19 10:38 AM] mrlynch#5735
aah, so you're looking for equality of outcome

[30-May-19 10:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's not how the world works and plenty of spec miners can tell u so

[30-May-19 10:40 AM] mrlynch#5735
sorry but your line of reasoning on this matter is flawed to say the least

[30-May-19 10:41 AM] mrlynch#5735
you NEED to mine the chain to get it going, you can't wait for 1000+ miners from btt to keep it alive

[30-May-19 10:41 AM] Tek#5253
> be me satoj
> invent crypto currency
> mine 1 million coins while testing stuff
> tell the world

[30-May-19 10:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
as a result, yes you do get a fair amount of coins until gpu, fpga and asics hit u

[30-May-19 10:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
that is incorrect

[30-May-19 10:42 AM] Tek#5253
> be me vitalik
> build ethereum

the world knew before he had 1 mil btc, way before

[30-May-19 10:42 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 10:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
i don't care about eth as i already mentioned

[30-May-19 10:43 AM] mrlynch#5735
but comparing dash instamine with btc consensus rule mining when only a few knew what crypto is - that is flawed

[30-May-19 10:43 AM] Tek#5253
the results are the same dude

[30-May-19 10:44 AM] mrlynch#5735
no they're not

[30-May-19 10:44 AM] mrlynch#5735
i just told you why

[30-May-19 10:44 AM] Tek#5253
i also just told you why

[30-May-19 10:44 AM] jorian#4555
satoshi didn't even know initially if it would all work out

[30-May-19 10:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
one creator has coins due to consensus rules, the other has it because greed and hopium for moon

[30-May-19 10:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
the methods and results are vastly different
