and yes, you can lose 1% if you gain 1.5% from the comp

[04-Mar-19 05:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And hedge against a 10-20% price increase after trading ends.

got a msg from a mate at work today saying, buy btc it will never be this cheap ever again....i thought to myself how in the earth does he know that, is he from the future?

[04-Mar-19 07:20 PM] Markus#5464
thats what i thought, if those whales want to push price down they will and they wont warn u about it

[04-Mar-19 07:22 PM] Markus#5464
Thats basically their way to test ppl with weak hands, they dump price and see if weak hands gonna react and sell. This is what they call dumb money. And thats why majority of ppl lose when it comes to trading cause they fall into those traps constantly

[04-Mar-19 07:35 PM] richardt#2807
Pretty much.  A lot of us here have been watching the crypto market long enough to know that the price of anything could be whatever the whales want it to be.  It's just nice when it works in our favor 😃

[04-Mar-19 07:41 PM] richardt#2807
For sure never if you're a noob.  For the traders who have been in the market a long time, it's easier to take advantage of the manipulation

[04-Mar-19 07:43 PM] Alecandro#1179
Anyone having issues with Blockfolio not updating KMD price from binance?

[04-Mar-19 07:43 PM] Alecandro#1179
KMd/btc

[04-Mar-19 09:53 PM] yorklab#7270
Using Tab Trader I can see KMD/BTC trading on the Huobi exchange. When I go to the Huobi exchange using my desktop KMD is not there?

[04-Mar-19 09:58 PM] yorklab#7270
Ah, It's on Huobi Global, they have two separate exchanges.

[05-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Vertigo#0439

our coin price is really taking it in the butt butt here bois

[05-Mar-19 02:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
At least people managed to buy at the 23 k level

[05-Mar-19 02:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Will it hold? That’s the question

[05-Mar-19 02:06 AM] bishop#9773
People bitching about the price at 23k after it was just in the mid-to-upper teens is just sad.

[05-Mar-19 02:07 AM] bishop#9773
Perhaps have a longer timeframe than 3 minutes

[05-Mar-19 02:08 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Yep you know people

[05-Mar-19 02:09 AM] Buddz1993#5380
They will always complain

[05-Mar-19 02:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
right in the butt!!

[05-Mar-19 02:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
seriously though i bought recently

[05-Mar-19 02:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
im on board dont worry

[05-Mar-19 02:18 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i like this HUOBI volume

[05-Mar-19 02:18 AM] Sdunbar#5064
probably going to go away after the contest though

[05-Mar-19 02:21 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Yea most likely

[05-Mar-19 02:21 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Me too

[05-Mar-19 02:27 AM] Vertigo#0439
So if we all donate 10kmd we can collect about 500kmd to keep the contest and the volume forever until we reach position #1 . There that is my plan.:troll_lol:

[05-Mar-19 02:49 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
at the rate BNB is going, it's going to be 10X in 3 months 😄

```at the rate BNB is going, it's going to be 10X in 3 months ```
Yea, a friend told me Komodo is a great project by KMD is not a good investment. He recommended BNB and he said all his money is gong there.....it's gone well over 2x since then. I still think KMD's time is coming though; it just hasn't arrived yet.

[05-Mar-19 03:47 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
a big green candle right after I made that comment 😄

[05-Mar-19 03:48 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
also It doesn't hurt to diversify as well

[05-Mar-19 04:26 AM] REX#3983

KMD FA AND TA. BNB horde. Ez buys.

[05-Mar-19 05:33 AM] Markus#5464
BNB look like 2017 bullrun, extremely overbought on even weekly chart

[05-Mar-19 05:34 AM] Markus#5464
Probably just Binance themselves making artificial pump and ppl ride along

[05-Mar-19 05:36 AM] Markus#5464
It have gone up every week since begin of december, just one week with a red candle being a ”doji”

$KMD 1D TF-

One of my favourite projects FA wise, also one of my favourite charts TA wise. Nice S&R flip on the daily, volume is increasing nicely, I charted KMD a few weeks back, as long BTC doesn't ruin the party this looks nice.
