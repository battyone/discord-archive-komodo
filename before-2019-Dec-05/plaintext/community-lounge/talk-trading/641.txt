totally possible depending on how many huge big shorts there are open

[13-May-19 02:43 PM] Tek#5253
Bitcoin / Litecoin
The block reward is constant, but it halves every 210000 blocks (840000 for litecoin).
Dogecoin
Simply 10000 doge for every block.
Dash
The block reward depends on the actual mining difficulty. It is 0.9*max(5, min(25, 2222222/((difficulty+2600)/9)^2)) every 210240th block the reward is reduced by 1/14th
Monero
The block reward of monero depends on the currently existing amount of coins. It looks like this max(0.6, (2^64 - 1 - coins*1000000000000) / 2^19 / 1000000000000)

`ouch kmd `
It's up 4% from yesterday

[13-May-19 03:47 PM] Strob#3417
yes better look at the KMD/USD chart than the KMD/BTC 😉

[13-May-19 03:49 PM] tolken#2655
Not watching the underlying current that is the btc price and just watching fiat. That’s definitely one way to do.

[13-May-19 03:50 PM] tolken#2655
Fascinating watching how the dynamics of various prices work.

[13-May-19 03:50 PM] Strob#3417
Think about what you can buy with 1 kmd, not what you could have bought if you traded your kmd for a btc!

[13-May-19 03:51 PM] tolken#2655
I personally see this as a kmd buying op. Fiat movement doesn’t suggest that though.

[13-May-19 03:51 PM] tolken#2655
I can’t buy much with one Kmd. @Strob

[13-May-19 03:52 PM] Strob#3417
It doesn't matter if you can buy much the question is: can you buy more than yesterday?

I just realized how insignificant I am in this market... If I would put all my crypto that I been collecting and cherish for two years  into Bitcoin and put if for sale at bid price it would be gone in less than a quarter of a second.

First time in 6 months I have no clue where this ends up in. 10k is my guess. But it will just be that guessing.

Whenever this is over you better have taken some profits. The fall will be just as drastic.
