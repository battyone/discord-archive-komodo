I think whale bro is an institutional investor. Likely not playing with solely their own money. That trading action was pro level accumulation strategy nonetheless.

[28-Oct-18 08:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r I think voting power can be one of the reason instead of only reason

[28-Oct-18 08:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodo tech is getting solid by every hour. Any mindful investor accumulating this much with such patience, I think must have understanding enough not to dump it in future..... ü§î at least not in one go....

[28-Oct-18 08:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess it can sure play a role in suppressing kmd price down in case of manipulation.....

selling pressure is like non existant on KMD

[28-Oct-18 11:20 PM] Tek#5253
on the other hand buying pressure isn't there either

[28-Oct-18 11:20 PM] Tek#5253
quick someone call whalebro tell him to flash his buywalls

I think bitcoin will move in Q1 / Q2 next year, when everything is setup

[28-Oct-18 11:45 PM] Alice#9607
We've got USDC now supported by the big boys. Tether wasn't good enough as we have seen.

daaaaamn they were at 60

[29-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alice#9607
Chart looks similar to komodo

[29-Oct-18 12:31 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
much less supply

[29-Oct-18 12:31 AM] Alice#9607
good entry point now from a ta perspective

[29-Oct-18 12:31 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
a little bit late with the pummp

[29-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Alice#9607
neblio has quite some volume on binance

[29-Oct-18 12:33 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
breakout was 21st oct

[29-Oct-18 12:33 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
that's when the volume came in

[29-Oct-18 12:34 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
1/4 of KMD market cap and less supply, I guess easier to move than KMD

[29-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Alice#9607
If you look at the chart, all these coins will move, when bitcoin wakes up

[29-Oct-18 12:41 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
but only in usd, when btc really starts amoving most ppl move into btc

[29-Oct-18 12:41 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
alts tank

[29-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Alice#9607
But we will get some spikes, like last year

[29-Oct-18 12:43 AM] Alice#9607
China will wake up soon, 15 min

[29-Oct-18 12:43 AM] Alice#9607
lets see if we get a move

[29-Oct-18 12:44 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Lowest volume in over a year two days in a row for BTC

[29-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Alice#9607
That is actually a good thing for BTC. Setting a base for the next move.

Not sure if allows to post this but anyone wanna buy up to $2500 AUD of Komodo at 1.5% under binance price? You know you‚Äôll end up costing yourself 2%+ if you transfer into btcm, pay the Btc difference then send to binance then buy üòõ

so its better to be hacked on a day with the market being up?

[29-Oct-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the hacker dumped and there doesnt seem to be a good day for it

[29-Oct-18 07:19 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Would be better for the hacker, not so much for the holders. I guess the timing doesn't matter to the hacker though.

[29-Oct-18 07:20 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Most people would call it hacking but I know it just someone figured out how to exploit the flawed contract.

$PRL creator wallet called the transferDirector function 6 hours ago, giving himself admin rights

New ¬´owner¬ª opened ICO sale function on contract

Sent ETH to contract and got PRL tokens at ICO price

Sent them to Kucoin crashed the price and probably ruined the project

solidity has some vulnerabilities?

[29-Oct-18 09:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
More likely someone coded something wrong

[29-Oct-18 09:12 PM] actionslacks#4072

[29-Oct-18 10:32 PM] Alice#9607
My new business model: 1) Audit a solidity code. 2) Take 10 BTC. 3) Contract blows up

[29-Oct-18 10:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
better busines model would be to do 3 audits and charge 30 BTC for the same contract which later blows up :trollface:

[29-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Alice#9607
@siu - Chainmakers lol

[29-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Alice#9607
