@Lanii

[04-Aug-19 05:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
@Lanii if you think alts are over cos they having a dip then you basically a moonboi

[04-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
usage and tangible products will be the next moon, not hyped whitepaper and guess which project has both of them

[04-Aug-19 05:46 PM] nocturnal#2177
exakerly

[04-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Lanii#8302
I never said alts are over

[04-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Lanii#8302
I said they are an instrument to make more btc

[04-Aug-19 05:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
hey at the moment its all speculation

[04-Aug-19 05:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
like gordon says, once the speculation period is over some alts will thrive

[04-Aug-19 05:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
most will die

[04-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Lanii#8302
They will

[04-Aug-19 05:48 PM] Lanii#8302
Doesnt stop me from selling when they do 10x

[04-Aug-19 05:48 PM] Lanii#8302
cuz "muh tech and this coin is just getting started" :troll_lol:

[04-Aug-19 05:49 PM] Markus#5464
i think not many of us here atm will be here when it mooned hard next upcoming years, many will have sold too early and wished they didnt

[04-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont belive alts are ever gonna make new ath vs btc

[04-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Lanii#8302
however btc will make new ath and previous run up on alts at 80% of ath will be new ath in usd value

[04-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Markus#5464
yes coins with no future will never make it

[04-Aug-19 05:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
i agree most of the alts around now might not make ath vs btc

[04-Aug-19 05:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
but some will

[04-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Markus#5464
ofc some will

[04-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if you believe the future is multicoins, then you need an interconnected smooth framework

[04-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and nSPV adaptive POW are all required to make that happen

[04-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
i think kmd proved it very well that its here to stay if u look at what happened during bear market

[04-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Lanii#8302
this is kmd on a monthly

[04-Aug-19 05:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
that entirely depends if it manages to actually get used by real world projects

[04-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Lanii#8302
First pop in june

[04-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Lanii#8302
then dump

[04-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Lanii#8302
Even during the crazy alt run it couldn't get up to the previous ath

[04-Aug-19 05:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
which crazy alt run?

[04-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Lanii#8302
late 2017

[04-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
alt run was begin of 2018

[04-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
not 2017

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Lanii#8302
that is 2018

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
i thinkyou are thinking short term

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Lanii#8302
first january

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Lanii#8302
how is that an alt run when that was the start of the dump

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
if komodo gets adopted then in ten years or so who knows

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Lanii#8302
same with iota and most other alts

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
not you not me

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh nobody knows

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
from below 20k to 100k in 1 month....i take that anytime of the day

[04-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Lanii#8302
but Im betting that neither kmd or any other alt will ever break ath in sats

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
wait october :)

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Lanii#8302
as I said doesnt mean that kmd cant go to 50 - 100 usd

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Lanii#8302
But then it could go to 80k sats and btc could be well above 50k

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] nocturnal#2177
any? thats a wierd outlook, but i agree with the main sentiment

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Lanii#8302
Do you understand my logic?

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes i got the dollar value point

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Lanii#8302
There could always be another kmd

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Lanii#8302
or another eth

[04-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Lanii#8302
another iota

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Lanii#8302
But can never be another btc

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
exactly, some alts will pop still, time is long.... kmd i have no idea

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
but its in with a shout

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
why do u need another copy of a already existing coin

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont need it lol

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Lanii#8302
But there can be

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
kmd is not trying to be eth if thats ur point

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Lanii#8302
There can always be a new coin with better tech

[04-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Lanii#8302
But thing is btc is special

[04-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Lanii#8302
The birth of it

[04-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Lanii#8302
and its history

[04-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Lanii#8302
thats the thing

[04-Aug-19 05:58 PM] nocturnal#2177
the first of the major alts to get used for something global will reach ath with ease

[04-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
to get global adoption any coin will go through one hell of a process i can tell u ðŸ˜„

[04-Aug-19 05:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah its not going to be anytime soon!

[04-Aug-19 05:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
but thats what im saying its quite short term point of view to say "no alts" will ever reach ath again

[04-Aug-19 05:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
imo

[04-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Lanii#8302
perhaps it is

[04-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Lanii#8302
But thats my plan

[04-Aug-19 06:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
having said that i have about 85% btc ðŸ˜‚

[04-Aug-19 06:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
so i do basically agree

[04-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Lanii#8302
I could say the same thing for the opposite

[04-Aug-19 06:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
lol

[04-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Lanii#8302
Talking about ath's when we about to break atl

[04-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Lanii#8302
is pretty stupid imo

[04-Aug-19 06:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
dude look at the charts....

[04-Aug-19 06:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
up down up down up down

[04-Aug-19 06:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
you just lost a bunch of btc value right?

[04-Aug-19 06:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
thats why you feeling this way?

[04-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Lanii#8302
Its true I lost a bunch of value on kmd cuz I dont really trade it, I hold cuz I belive in the tech

[04-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Lanii#8302
But I mostly trade on mex

[04-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Lanii#8302
so kmd is a hold

[04-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Lanii#8302
But that has nothing to do with why I "feel" this way

[04-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Lanii#8302
Its the rules that I apply

[04-Aug-19 06:02 PM] nocturnal#2177
i reckon amost alts will die fo sho

[04-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Lanii#8302
on my TA that is telling me that we won't ever see a new ath on alts in sats value

[04-Aug-19 06:03 PM] nocturnal#2177
but when you say "alts" that doesnt mean anything

[04-Aug-19 06:03 PM] nocturnal#2177
as a whole market maybe not

[04-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Lanii#8302
Most if not all alts look the same

[04-Aug-19 06:03 PM] nocturnal#2177
anyway i dont know, chat in ten years

[04-Aug-19 06:03 PM] nocturnal#2177
we find out

[04-Aug-19 06:03 PM] dan.#2473
Let's add some fuel to laniis argument. Let's presume btc is here to stay and will make one more big cycle before stabilizing. Why the fuck would Wall Street want to give value to alt coins at that point. It's very possible this the last fomo for alts, or the buying opportunity of the decade for alts

[04-Aug-19 06:04 PM] dan.#2473
Kill alts before btc flies is the possible wall St plan

[04-Aug-19 06:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
i agree with all that although i think alts will have another couple of cycles probably before most of them die

[04-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Lanii#8302
Im pretty sure of one thing, there is no hedge funds that would hold something after it exploded 10x+

[04-Aug-19 06:04 PM] dan.#2473
Or, this is the best opportunity to buy ever. Who knows

[04-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Lanii#8302
Specially if kmd goes to 100k+ sats and btc is around 60k
