Maybe the flippening is happening. Where projects with actual tech will be at the top of the market cap

@blackjok3r you've been making good progress. You think about adding encryption to your file transfer functionality?

[31-Dec-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The file streamer is pretty low level... UIt just takes hex string input, and splits it into the maximum size that fits into OP_RETURN. The actual dApp side of it could easily add encryption to the file before sending... it can be used to stream video or anything I would imagine.

[31-Dec-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a special blockchain like permissioned almost as it only has a single miner.

[31-Dec-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was still very much noob when I made it, it can be imporved a fair bit... but it was extremly fast with 2MB blocks, liekly even faster now we have 4MB blocks.

[31-Dec-18 06:26 AM] jspook16#3059
Single miner? I guess that could be a use case for not being taken offline by a server provider. I still think it's really good progress. You could do a decentralized YouTube type structure

[31-Dec-18 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah. to make it actually work. I needed to make it have only one miner... as as the person streaming owns the chain, it made sense to do it that way.

[31-Dec-18 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Each file would be a new chain... or maybe X files... you can put more than one per chain.
