`Do you really think 2071 listed coins on coinmarketcap is useful ?`
The first problem is that you assume that coinmarketcap is useful ...

there are quite a few komodo ecosystem tokens that are not listed on coinmarketcap.

that doesn't make them bad/inferior to those that are listed on CMC

[26-Nov-18 09:25 PM] crumb#2550
people get too hung up on being on the CMC

[26-Nov-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
9 million people could use CoinX as a daily currency and it might not even appear on cmc; does that make it not worthy of being one of the "10" cryptos that we "need"?

@Caglio  we are experiencing  the same thing that happened during the dotcom bubble, most of those 2071 coins (ICO scam, p&d coins, mlm, vaporware ...  ) will likely get purged , those with solid tech  & serious team will likely remain.

'history doesn't repeat, it rhymes' like the saying goes. yes many parallels/similarities can be drawn with dotcom boom

[26-Nov-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
` those with solid tech & serious team will likely remain`
That's the key, there's nothing wrong with 200 gajillion currencies existing, as long as they have usefulness and convey value
Decreeing that `only *x* coins should exist` requires fanboyism to whittle down "value" to only *x*

[26-Nov-18 09:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You do need good business devs though

[26-Nov-18 09:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You can have the best coin in the world but if projects/companies dont know you exist or choose whatever other platform

[26-Nov-18 09:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nobody cares

[26-Nov-18 09:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
true  this

[26-Nov-18 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nintendo 64 was better than playstation, but still more people bought a playstation

[26-Nov-18 09:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And countless other examples, but that was the first one on my mind

They will care when our marketing & biz devs kick in, at least we don't do marketing stuffs / biz devs stuffs without working tech like most ICO do üò¨

[26-Nov-18 11:04 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Well hopefully but we've been talkin about it kickin in for what seems like forever now

[26-Nov-18 11:14 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its all about market momentum also

[26-Nov-18 11:14 PM] Buddz1993#5380
market momentum is def not great now.

[26-Nov-18 11:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
The elimination of all the noise from the ico scams and shitcoins should be helpful. Also, there are likely many developers looking for some work right now. I‚Äôm not sure how many bounties kmd has going rn but it could be smart to advertise them on some related projects forums, discords, etc.

[26-Nov-18 11:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Who is the sadistic sun of a gun on Dig Pri filling KMD market sells at 11K sats.   Damn you lucky mofo.

[26-Nov-18 11:47 PM] Vertigo#0439
What was KMD ico price?

[27-Nov-18 12:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
I guess I should I have put it all on SV, amazing fundamentals

Yeah posted in here days ago, it was a wise move to buy a to be of sv almost as soon as it dumped after listing...

[27-Nov-18 12:11 AM] Vertigo#0439
Oh found it was $0.37

[27-Nov-18 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Went to bed after this king that woke up to it risen 50%

[27-Nov-18 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Decided not to bother

[27-Nov-18 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess its Stoll going up

[27-Nov-18 12:11 AM] Vertigo#0439
But why??? Is a shitcoin fork...

[27-Nov-18 12:12 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they burning money to get it high

it's being pumped against a bear market and is up 25%.... totally legit

[27-Nov-18 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made nearly all of my crypto gains playing the bch/btc fork for the same reason

[27-Nov-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When its under a certain price, you can predict they will pump it

[27-Nov-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its free mobey

[27-Nov-18 12:13 AM] Vertigo#0439
What is a gain?

[27-Nov-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When you just taking g no ey from people so rich they are destroying their money their eis no loser

[27-Nov-18 12:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
this BTC Cyber Monday price, it keeps going lower! Race to the bottom.

[27-Nov-18 12:14 AM] Vertigo#0439
90% off today only! Tomorrow maybe 95

[27-Nov-18 12:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Csw said he crashing it to $1000, although I don't think that one guy has enough money to keep it there, there are plenty of other crypro enemies who have literally unlimited cash

[27-Nov-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is not surprising

[27-Nov-18 12:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's not surprising, it just hurts for those that don't have fiat nipples to suckle from

[27-Nov-18 12:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It sucks don't get me wrong, I wish I sold.more just as much as the next guy, I'm just saying I fully expected this to happen and am not worried about it.

[27-Nov-18 12:16 AM] Vertigo#0439
I spent my last Fiat in KMD at $0.95 it looked like a bargain like two weeks ago.

[27-Nov-18 12:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That happens :( kmd will at least be a survivor

[27-Nov-18 12:16 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i kept thinking it was a bargain at 7 dollars, 5 dollars, 3 dollars, 1 dollar.. etc etc

[27-Nov-18 12:16 AM] Sdunbar#5064
25 cents i will buy

[27-Nov-18 12:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
"Averaging down", it's a feature, not a bug üòâ

[27-Nov-18 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This project is too big now to disappear.

[27-Nov-18 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cost averaging is a good play

[27-Nov-18 12:17 AM] BlackJesus#6161
im cost averaging bch and kmd

[27-Nov-18 12:17 AM] BlackJesus#6161
and mining kmd

[27-Nov-18 12:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bch was a good idea before the fork, now how to you k ow which one to choose?

[27-Nov-18 12:18 AM] BlackJesus#6161
im going with the abc crew

[27-Nov-18 12:18 AM] Vertigo#0439
Im only holding Kmd and some uncleared BTC still processing on Gemini....

[27-Nov-18 12:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bch ABC chain is broken from some stupid 10 block auto checkpoint

[27-Nov-18 12:18 AM] BlackJesus#6161
unlimited is still bipartisan but only deving for the abc version

[27-Nov-18 12:18 AM] BlackJesus#6161
which retained the bch ticker

[27-Nov-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are at least 4 implementations of Bitcoin Cash

[27-Nov-18 12:19 AM] BlackJesus#6161
yup

[27-Nov-18 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Btc is useless and broken with 1mb blocks, snt currency, btc sv is backed by bigoney, bit seems determined to take down the entire crypto market...

[27-Nov-18 12:19 AM] BlackJesus#6161
bitcoin legacy has a single implementation

[27-Nov-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
how can anybody keep track of all this shit. I am a dev and I can't keep track of all the BCH madness

[27-Nov-18 12:19 AM] BlackJesus#6161
and bitcoin sv will have a single implkementation as well.

[27-Nov-18 12:19 AM] BlackJesus#6161
bitcoin cash will retain the multiplicity

[27-Nov-18 12:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
bitcoin ABC, while being less douchey than SV, has decided to make less-than-awesome tech decisions, to the point of going against very basic PoW stuff

When SV fork?

[27-Nov-18 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Csw keep saying he wants competing implementations but then attacks everything that isn't what he wants... Crazy man.

[27-Nov-18 12:21 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I think bch is going to just stay bch and further improve the base protocol.

[27-Nov-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So far thats not what they are doing @BlackJesus

[27-Nov-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They r breaking it

[27-Nov-18 12:22 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea the checkpoint thing was pretty meh for me

[27-Nov-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its fucki g idiotic

[27-Nov-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only way to do that is with dpow type implementation

BCH is a failed project

[27-Nov-18 12:23 AM] Vertigo#0439
All about bch and it's forks is business and publicity stunts only I don't see any real interested in developing.

[27-Nov-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can't set it I. The code to just checkpoint every 10 blocks. It will fork constantly

[27-Nov-18 12:23 AM] BlackJesus#6161
yea, because without the consensus of the checkpoint its going to be centrally determined at the node

[27-Nov-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the devs set the checkpoint in the code is that any different to core doing what they did to btc...

[27-Nov-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bitcoin in all its implementations is close to dead, pretty sure one of them will win though it's impossible to work out what one at this point.

[27-Nov-18 12:32 AM] Vertigo#0439
Well has has gone down a lot in the last two weeks.

[27-Nov-18 12:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
