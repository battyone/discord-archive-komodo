[10-Aug-19 04:51 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[10-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[10-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[10-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Markus#5464
if development speed will keep going like now then it can get rly interesting

[10-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Markus#5464
kinda need to think of new ideas pretty quick

[10-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Markus#5464
but just thinking that JL thought of atomic swaps already few years ago and barely nobody are developing that even today thats pretty cool

[10-Aug-19 04:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Time traveler

[10-Aug-19 05:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380

and he could also proove his identity by showing the current block number of 2025

[10-Aug-19 05:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so

[10-Aug-19 05:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but it's a good alternative reality if it happened lol

[10-Aug-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the names were changed

[10-Aug-19 05:09 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
777 better invents something normie friendly so when market is better and normies get interested again, normies will moon our bags.

[10-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX is coming along nicely

[10-Aug-19 05:09 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
üëç

[10-Aug-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
also nspv html wallet without JS, shows how to securely generate web gui from inside the cli

[10-Aug-19 05:12 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I was thinking it taht would be interesting experiment to have a coin with APR playing against all alts drop - for example when alts price stable the APR monthly would be like 3-5% but when alt prices go down like 10% then APR goes to 10%, so when you buy and hodl .. that would be a real hodl coin, not sure if time locking should be applied, but oracles would be needed for price indexing, @jl777c  is there already sth like this ?

[10-Aug-19 05:12 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
html wallet w/o js sounds cool

[10-Aug-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
you could make such a bet using prices CC, but not sure if there will be enough equity to cover any large winnings

[10-Aug-19 05:15 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I mean apr would be like KMD apr - generating same coin , the diff to KMD - with changed amounts based on conditions - the more dumping on the market, the higher % stake

[10-Aug-19 05:15 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so that it would make sense to have such coin when market dropping - cause yo uget more % theb daytraiding, and when market is calm, just 3-5% APR, so you never loose when hodling

[10-Aug-19 05:15 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
could be kind of hype coin though üòÉ

[10-Aug-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
without actual backing it would be a silly coin

[10-Aug-19 05:17 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
ok so does nto make sense

[10-Aug-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe as a game it can work

[10-Aug-19 05:21 PM] stealth#9257
I‚Äôm staking in binance for the kmd giveaway.

[10-Aug-19 05:22 PM] stealth#9257
Don‚Äôt love having on exchange but 300k is a big pool

[10-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I don't if staking should be the right word used

[10-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Buddz1993#5380
although Binance used the same word.

[10-Aug-19 05:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[10-Aug-19 05:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[10-Aug-19 05:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[10-Aug-19 05:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
The fees etc

[10-Aug-19 05:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

Of holdings

[10-Aug-19 05:44 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lol I wouldn't mind seeing CZ broke or in Jail

[10-Aug-19 05:44 PM] Caglio#3337
why ?

[10-Aug-19 05:44 PM] Caglio#3337
i kinda like em more than fee coinbase

[10-Aug-19 05:44 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Because of his smug face

[10-Aug-19 05:45 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
And takeover of crypto market

[10-Aug-19 05:45 PM] Slyris#2880
I'm really thinking about doing some modern c++ library around CC @jl777c

[10-Aug-19 05:45 PM] Slyris#2880
Just for fun, I want to develop a game framework around

[10-Aug-19 05:45 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Coinbase is hot garbage compared

[10-Aug-19 05:45 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 fees are sick

[10-Aug-19 05:46 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Dude it's basicially a datamining operation with exchange

[10-Aug-19 05:46 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's only my conspiracy theory but it's probably cia or something lmao

[10-Aug-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
@Slyris a good idea

[10-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c I want to develop a game like Wakfu, where one of the job is miner, and I want player to mine and made their coins like this game

[10-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Slyris#2880
Do you think this is possible to do like real mining in the game ? Like short time (10 seconds)

[10-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Slyris#2880
And it's generate real coins for this game I mean

[10-Aug-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
coincidentally we are discussing selfhashing tx, that maybe generates new coins, so yes this concept is possible

[10-Aug-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be that the coins are premined and locked in a CC address

[10-Aug-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case it is very easy to do

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but I mean those coins will be in a wallet for the mlayer

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you need the coins to actually be created per tx, that will be a bit of extra work

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Slyris#2880
Player

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Slyris#2880
Each player have a wallet

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, in both cases, the coins will go into the users wallet

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Slyris#2880
So good idea

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
or whichever address they say to mine to

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Slyris#2880
I think it's a good idea

[10-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Slyris#2880
To do a multiplayer game like that
