Soon, the whales will have to prove their worth to us!

[09-Mar-19 01:04 AM] pinkcookie#4334
Exactly @actionslacks kmd has done nothing but show and prove over the last year or so

people need to wake up and appreciate the innovative tech being produced

Wealth is in the eye of the beholder. Lambos for everyone in 10 years

[09-Mar-19 01:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think some income property would be a better investment

[09-Mar-19 01:08 AM] 74D30#6106
Before or after the crash?

[09-Mar-19 01:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
March 28th - I am calling it.

[09-Mar-19 01:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
35% day on KMD.

[09-Mar-19 01:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Sometime around 7:77 PM.

[09-Mar-19 01:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Might go to the 32th of March another 35%.

[09-Mar-19 01:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm sure there are quite a few people who can afford a lambo but choose to buy something more practical

[09-Mar-19 02:17 AM] Draeth#3300
like a 94 toyota camry

[09-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I had an 88 Camry 5 speed at one point

[09-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Beat the shit out of that thing

Solid car for what it was

[09-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Paid $500 for it

[09-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Any interest in a stateside meetup? I know we got some numbers

[09-Mar-19 09:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, I would like to have one

[09-Mar-19 09:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
wonder how we could go about organizing it

[09-Mar-19 10:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Basically just got to get a place, create an agenda for the meetup, set a date , get materials and off to the races.   I have a buddy who has organized crypto meetups before I‚Äôll pick his brain to find out more

[09-Mar-19 10:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Figure it‚Äôs going to be primarily not tech folk,  more just demonstrations and high level overview and starting collaboration to accomplish larger goals

[09-Mar-19 11:29 AM] Lumbi#8378
york, pa is where harley davidson was founded, but arguably not as cool as miami, la, chicago or nyc...

[09-Mar-19 11:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol not arguably , it just isn‚Äôt

[09-Mar-19 11:40 AM] actionslacks#4072

[09-Mar-19 11:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Colorado would be a good place, lots of local crypto enthusiasts from what i hear,  I could try to get something in Pittsburgh going but pit isn‚Äôt the best of locations

yes been a nice run

[09-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
though it would have been nice if it could have held the rankings in the top 50

[09-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
its okay though its done well overall

[09-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Sdunbar#5064
The volume has always been pretty low though relative to the rank

[09-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Sdunbar#5064
right now of the top 100 coins the market cap is 53rd but volume is about 85th

[09-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Sdunbar#5064
the lack of erratic movement one way or another amazes me

[09-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Sdunbar#5064
things are so different now than they used to be even a year ago

[09-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Sdunbar#5064
wtf happened lol

[09-Mar-19 04:53 PM] yorklab#7270
I think it's because of the futures market. Without it, who knows where BTC would be now.

[09-Mar-19 04:54 PM] Sdunbar#5064
1 million?

[09-Mar-19 04:56 PM] yorklab#7270
Who knows. But I have read that because of the futures market BTC may not have another meteoric rise like it had in the past.

[09-Mar-19 04:57 PM] yorklab#7270
A more steady climb and less volatility.

[09-Mar-19 04:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Yea I see that also

[09-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Markus#5464
its almost better for the average joe if its not too much volatility

[09-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Markus#5464
then less intelligent ppl who dont trade dont have to worry about loosing enormous amounts of cash in no time

[09-Mar-19 05:14 PM] yorklab#7270
Important for ETFs and large investors also. So, as much as I hate the futures market slowing down bitcoin's potential, I suppose  it will benefit everyone by helping to curb the volitivity and thereby encouraging more people to get evolved.

[09-Mar-19 05:15 PM] Markus#5464
bitcoin will most likely not lead the crypto market sooner or later

[09-Mar-19 05:16 PM] Markus#5464
but then again huge volatility can be a reason why we dont see adoption increassing cause imagine ppl with no knowledge of trading putting 10k into btc and next day its worth 9k, thats a big loss for ppl who have a normal job

[09-Mar-19 05:16 PM] yorklab#7270
Something I'm starting to hear more is that the big institutions want to steer clear of POW coins. So I tend to agree that other coins may take over at one point. But for now it's still about bitcoin.

[09-Mar-19 05:16 PM] Markus#5464
and most of ppl would sell at that point

[09-Mar-19 05:16 PM] Markus#5464
thats why ~90% lose

[09-Mar-19 05:17 PM] Markus#5464
Ye true

If $ENJIN can pump because of a #samsung partnership, then why hasn't #komodo $kmd pumped in light of a partnership with #amazon #aws and a series of industry leading achievements throughout the bear market? I'm actually expecting a new ATH in 2019 of around 177k sats.

[09-Mar-19 05:39 PM] Markus#5464
177k, hm...i approve

[09-Mar-19 05:41 PM] Markus#5464
but then again i have read things like "anyone can have partnership with aws just registering", but again thats uneducated ppl not reading partnership details or who just wanna talk bs

[09-Mar-19 05:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
177k stats lol

[09-Mar-19 05:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
where do people get these numbers from

[09-Mar-19 05:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
sats*

[09-Mar-19 06:14 PM] yorklab#7270
Perhaps we'll hear more official announcements about the relationship between Komodo and Amazon as part of the rebrand announcements that are sure to come.

[09-Mar-19 06:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
177k sats is ridiculous

[09-Mar-19 06:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Read a bunch of articles written by pundits huh. Let me know how that works for you

[10-Mar-19 05:05 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@74D30  I have a couple of points i use when looking at crypto projects for longterm. Its short but has been my basic rule for a while. 
1. Is it new Algo , How long has it been out / mined if pow. What new problem is it solving , has it been done before. 
2. Supply. Some will disagree but i like a low to medium supply. Bitcoin being low supply ripple being high supply. 
3. General gut feeling of scam or not üòÇ

[10-Mar-19 05:06 PM] 74D30#6106
@CryptoNinjaa good advice right there

[10-Mar-19 05:06 PM] sœÜldat#8733
