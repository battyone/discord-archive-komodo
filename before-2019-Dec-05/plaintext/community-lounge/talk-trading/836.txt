how is resistance dex an elephant?

[24-Jun-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
do they have a working release?

[24-Jun-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and atomicDEX comes into the world where CEX does 99.999% of trades, so what does another DEX existing matter

[24-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Duck Tape#9059
No, they don't. Their Discord is almost dead. But....They have the publicity.

[24-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253
discord is a good indicaton of project

[24-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Lumbi#8378
Distributed is the way to go. "DL" = distributed ledger

[24-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253

[24-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253
don't bother

[24-Jun-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
well, publicity is all that matters

[24-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Like, why would anyone use your dex when there is this hyped up resDex? Just asking>

[24-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Tek#5253
Holy shit look at funfair

[24-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Tek#5253

[24-Jun-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
does resdex exist?

[24-Jun-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
do they have a mobile dex?

[24-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Nope. net yet. But, maybe July

[24-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Duck Tape#9059
I doubt it. I think they now realize it is more difficult than they first thought.

[24-Jun-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, the cross chain DEX market is gigantic

[24-Jun-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810

I am just afraid that ResDex will be more popular than all the Komodo Dex's. If they are first.

[24-Jun-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
they wont be first

[24-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Markus#5464
im sure this price of kmd gonna be peanuts very soon and many will regret not jumping on it on this prices

I remember getting my pay money when the price of KMD was at peak, and I also remember when I got my pay money when it was at peanuts

[24-Jun-19 08:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to be honest, it really never mattered to me what price it went up or down, as long as it was paying me my monthly bills üòÑ

A scalable, sufficiently decentralized, chain that supported private transactions by default (privacy coins) would be a game changer.

@CHMEX thanks for the response but Im actually wondering why not one person has claimed their money was stolen.  Kinda weird

[25-Jun-19 05:35 AM] ryman112#0068
Or was no crypto stolen and kmd acted before it could happen?

[25-Jun-19 05:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes there was some kmd stolen i believe around 700k

[25-Jun-19 05:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
Around 8m or more saved by jl before the hacker took it

[25-Jun-19 05:43 AM] ryman112#0068
That is awesome that he saved it.  Just wondering why nobody ever came out and said anything.  It would be a first.

[25-Jun-19 05:46 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
450k were from Digitalprice.io, that leaves 350k stolen from users. I remember reading 1 or 2 in Discord that had been stolen, not swept to safety, but the claim procedure was the same on either case

[25-Jun-19 05:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
seems like he was waiting for the biggest fish. and that he found out somehow that his plan was discovered before kmd started moving funds.

[25-Jun-19 06:09 AM] designer#4893
the journey to $100,000 has begun. the world will be noisy for as long as six months or a year. bitcoin has strong.

[25-Jun-19 06:10 AM] ryman112#0068
Why wouldn't he or she take what they could get?  Sorry I question everything.

where's the best place to trade some kmd with pirate?

[25-Jun-19 06:41 AM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd price under ico :-(

[25-Jun-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
@ryman112 over a dozen people spoke up, they just dont broadcast it in public usually

[25-Jun-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and in all confirmed cases, indeed, the hacker proved they were stolen from by spending all the funds at the same time to the same destination

[25-Jun-19 06:51 AM] ryman112#0068
Usually they do and cause a ruckus.  Im just asking and the fact that you take the time tells me all I need to know.  Much respect!

[25-Jun-19 06:55 AM] ryman112#0068
Another question is what about people who hodl and may check a year from now.... what happens?

[25-Jun-19 06:56 AM] ryman112#0068
You must have a contingency plan for that correct?

[25-Jun-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the funds stay in the sweep account, so they can contact us anytime, but sooner is much better than later

[25-Jun-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the contingency plan is to not change anything from now, other than the frequency

[25-Jun-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
already, it seems 95%+ are refunded and just some stragglers

[25-Jun-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
all the claims that we did this to take funds from people are just idiotic, as already i have put in over 250000 to deal with the stolen funds and all claims coming in will increase that even more, ultimately up to 732,000

[25-Jun-19 07:00 AM] ryman112#0068
The stragglers are the ones Im worried about.  This space is very objective and some like myself used to not bother in having any contact whatsoever which is what most do.  What happens to their funds?

[25-Jun-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
are you not reading what i wrote?

not sure what you are being skeptical about, all the sweep and refunds are all on the blockchain, and can be fully verified

[25-Jun-19 07:03 AM] ryman112#0068
I am sceptical and you should understand that.  I respect you without knowing you and I just wanna understand.

[25-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
skeptical about what?
