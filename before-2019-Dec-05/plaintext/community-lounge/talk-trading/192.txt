Forget Buterin's 500 TX/S, Researchers Explore 17,000 TX/S on Ethereum
This week, Ethereum researchers introduced a solution called snark-based side chain, which could scale the network to 17,000 transactions per second.

using offchain channels...
"Operators with malicious intent could deny the withdrawal of funds in the channel and potentially sabotage the channel that maintains a large storage of transactional data.

But, the system’s built-in protocol that punishes malicious operators by replacing them and degrading the channel to an on-chain token disallows any further alternations to be made on the channel."

[09-Oct-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if that means the recovery is correcting the sabotage, or prevents further sabotage

it all just seems much cleaner to just have independent chains

[09-Oct-18 08:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`disallows any further alternations to be made on the channel`
Wouldn't that also mean that any users on that channel would have their tokens locked and be screwed? Or am I interpreting that wrong?

[09-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810

if you remove the blockchain that provides the security of the transactions, it isnt that big of a surprise that it isnt secure

[09-Oct-18 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a problem with all the sharding "solutions" I have seen

Thanks for sharing your thoughts about this article guys

[09-Oct-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt have any where the detail needed, but any channel based setup seems like it is really dependent on whoever controls the channel

[09-Oct-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
without their good behavior, bad things happen, or at least it seems it can grind to a halt, which sort of messes up any speed gained

[09-Oct-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and being dependent on a single node seems quite opposite to decentralizaion, whatever subset of traffic going through the channel is centralized

[09-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
independent chains dont have this issue, as it is an independent chain with all the blockchain logic to prevent censorship, etc.

[09-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
and independent chain just do their thing at normal speeds. combined, you get a big aggregate speed, but you have the problem of cross chain communication

[09-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810

[09-Oct-18 09:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@polycryptoblog I agree that it was "worse" a year ago, but Komodo was also "less" then too. The things that have been done on, and with, Komodo in the last year are incredible by any standard.

They can't deny us forever .  I remember meeting Julian hosp and discussing atomic swaps in Texas ,  at the time @siu - Chainmakers completed the first doge to eth swap.  Couple months later during the Komodo meetup he does some retard tweet about being the first to do atomic swaps with Ethereum ,  called him on his shit

'atomic swaps' the thing that was basically designed by the bitcoin guys, implemented by several "shitcoin" forks of bitcoin, Bitcoin will be the "last" to add (for all intents and purposes), and Bitcoin gets heralded for maybe adding "at some future point" 🤦🏼

The problem with atomic swaps is tuat the marketing is misguided

[09-Oct-18 09:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In chain token swaps are easy

[09-Oct-18 09:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@polycryptoblog at Auckland Blockchain Meetup I had told Andreas Antonopolus about BarterDEX and it's Atomic Swaps tech, and while on the stage he still mentioned that there is no working atomic solution yet to his knowledge.

[09-Oct-18 09:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Soon after his talk I approached him and asked why he still said so where I explained to him the working progress of BarterDEX, and he said the issues like Transactions Malleability aren't yet solved to his knowledge.

[09-Oct-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not much sound on my blockchain internals and it's issues so I asked him to explain tx malleability in laymans terms and then told him that to my knowledge it's fixed in Barterdex tech.

[09-Oct-18 09:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that evening I sent him couple of links, and the next day asked if he got a chance to take a look at those....

[09-Oct-18 09:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
he's a busy man I agree, but I only understand they all are either Bitcoin Maximalist, or Ethereum or just not really being updated themselves with new updates on the tech solution

[09-Oct-18 09:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
He *is* a BTC maximalist, or at least from every vid I've seen him in

[09-Oct-18 09:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
From that point of view, I believe many must have possibly discarded to look at Komodo Platform tech, thinking it another shitcoin in the crowd. But they can not avoid it as long as the work done by the dev teams keep progressing and making it even better by every single hour!

[09-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX sidesteps the malleability issue by requiring you show your utxo before starting the swap

[09-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and then waiting for confirms during the swap

[09-Oct-18 09:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, but I can not force anybody to look at the links and read and change their mind. I can only let them know and leave them alone to their opinion.

[09-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and checking to make sure you didnt spend the payment in a way not agreed to, and extracting the secret needed to spend your half

I do not expect any high influencer to say name of KMD until something naturally organic big marketing thing happens.

Later Andreas also mentioned Komodo working on Atomic Swaps tech in one of his Q&A video on his YouTube channel, mentioning it just a basic Atomic Swaps tech... 😅

[09-Oct-18 09:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
He still think Lightening Network is the only advanced and ultimate Atomic Swaps tech there can ever be.

[09-Oct-18 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The markets don't reflect tech, that's the sad truth. If they did, a ton more people would have the same reaction to Komodo now that I did over a year ago ... "This is some neat shit, actively doing things, and something I can't pass up on".
I realize that to a certain extent I'm as bad as the BTC maximalists in my view of Komodo's place in the space, but I will never not be able to see that this is a great thing.

[09-Oct-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I go rarely to local Bitcoin and Blockchain Meetups. I honestly look for a good technical opinion from people about Komodo Platform. From those who are technical sound. My way of talking on the subject is not to offend other projects and also not to just talk about what project I'm in.

I'm genuinely interested to hear a good criticism about Komodo Platform.
After all I have my life savings holding in Komodo Platform and I am spending my Career and my Identity being attached to Komodo Platform (either directly or indirectly). Nothing will give me more pleasure to see a technical unbiased criticism of Komodo Platform.
But I never got much of a response on this subject by the people I met in person.

[09-Oct-18 09:48 AM] snowdamn#2414
marketcap would have to reach at least $50B for me to start feeling bad about being a KMD die hard 😂

The only criticism I heard from a guy here is that delayed Proof of Work depends on 64 Notary Nodes, and a collusion of these 64 Notary Nodes could be somehow be a vulnerability point for the Komodo Platform.
And much of the things are being done/worked about dPoW.

I don't agree with this, but I for sure want a more streamlined and more better process in Notary Node setups and automation. 🙂
