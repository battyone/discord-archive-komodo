That Cred thing sounds awesome

[02-Aug-18 05:01 PM] tolken#2655
Kmd purchasing through an iOS App? That sounds very low friction. Hope I read that right.

[02-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just keep grinding and building out

[02-Aug-18 05:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
When the money comes trickling back in they‚Äôll (hopefully) see who put work in

[02-Aug-18 05:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And who didn‚Äôt do shit

[02-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ARK is a good example of coins where you can just see the github activiry drop during the bear period

[02-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd team does not give two shits

@CryptoMichNL $kmd was hauled out back like a rabid dog and shot in the face with a 12 gauge.  Totally unfair!

Really putting that squeeze on the alt coin market now. Lets see who has the balls to stay in.

[02-Aug-18 05:51 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Wonder how low it can all go.
Im facing a closure bill for electricity next month.. and i expect to have to add some money... like 1k
Now all crypto down.. have to sell more than expected.

[02-Aug-18 06:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
are we ded enough yet?

[02-Aug-18 06:02 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Hard to say. Good chance it will all go down further. They need to really get that despair to set in.

[02-Aug-18 07:06 PM] neokensou#2575
Any news why we are dropping?

[02-Aug-18 07:11 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
maybe because all the market is dropping?

[02-Aug-18 07:12 PM] neokensou#2575
Maybe every coin is not dropping as hard as komodo?

[02-Aug-18 07:13 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
where do you see it dropping more? it's same relative position

[02-Aug-18 07:16 PM] neokensou#2575
Only 4 coins or tokens have a a greater change in 24 hours than Komodo in the ranking before its position

[02-Aug-18 07:17 PM] neokensou#2575
I supposed its not just the bear market. I was asking if you guys know anything else

[02-Aug-18 07:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Capitulation

[02-Aug-18 07:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
on CMC I count 10 other coins above Kmd with greater 24h drop

[02-Aug-18 07:19 PM] neokensou#2575
On top 65?

[02-Aug-18 07:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
tomorrow they will up, then down, etc... seems just following the bear

[02-Aug-18 07:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes

[02-Aug-18 07:20 PM] neokensou#2575
You are counting top 100

[02-Aug-18 07:20 PM] neokensou#2575
whatever, its ok

[02-Aug-18 07:21 PM] neokensou#2575
no reason

[02-Aug-18 07:21 PM] neokensou#2575
its ok

[02-Aug-18 07:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
vechain, walton, waves, stratis, icon... even more down than kmd

[02-Aug-18 07:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it will continue until bitcoin stops crashing the party

[02-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Portfolio is at April 2017 valuation roughly

[02-Aug-18 07:26 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Komodo has entered deep into the support zone. Now to see it holds which looks like a fight is happening right now.

[02-Aug-18 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I know the marketing flaw of kmd

[02-Aug-18 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The name, komodo

[02-Aug-18 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A real life animal that you know exist

[02-Aug-18 08:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
To go to the moon you need a space name

[02-Aug-18 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
To be the future you need a sci-fi name

[02-Aug-18 08:39 PM] xRobeSx#5136
The space komodo üòÉ

[02-Aug-18 08:40 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Some say that there Reptilian type ET's.... james could be an ET this whole time naming everything based on lizards

[02-Aug-18 08:40 PM] xRobeSx#5136
there's the space connection ha

[02-Aug-18 08:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[02-Aug-18 08:41 PM] xRobeSx#5136
google reptilian et's

[02-Aug-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the alts the recent days have the identical chart

[02-Aug-18 08:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hunter S. Thomson saw people as reptiles when he tripped on acid

[02-Aug-18 08:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There you have you reptilian connection with space

[02-Aug-18 08:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
all of the brightest minds have used acid

[02-Aug-18 08:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe james had the same hallucinations

[02-Aug-18 08:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
you have to look at a basket of alts to see it

[02-Aug-18 08:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
one alt at a time is tricky

[02-Aug-18 08:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
create your own index

[02-Aug-18 08:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
then you'll see it

[02-Aug-18 08:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
keep the same basket in the index

[02-Aug-18 08:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
always

[02-Aug-18 08:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I see a LOT of coins with bigger loses than kmd today...  dont know why someome was saying earlier that kmd was the biggest loser

[02-Aug-18 08:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Might be the biggest loser in their bag?

[02-Aug-18 08:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That makes more sense

[02-Aug-18 08:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
when you create your own index you'll see that all the moves are automated

[02-Aug-18 08:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
don't be fooled

[02-Aug-18 08:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
and you have to look at BTC/USD

[02-Aug-18 08:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also we need an enemy

[02-Aug-18 08:52 PM] neokensou#2575
an enemy?

[02-Aug-18 08:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[02-Aug-18 08:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
EOS VS. ETH

[02-Aug-18 08:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Tron vs. Eth

[02-Aug-18 08:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Substratum say they are making something better than tor

[02-Aug-18 08:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Using "good encryption"

[02-Aug-18 08:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol

[02-Aug-18 08:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Btc  vs. Bch

[02-Aug-18 08:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Zec vs. Monero

[02-Aug-18 08:54 PM] neokensou#2575
I don't see a reason to have an enemy. This is not a battle for consumers

[02-Aug-18 08:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
even better way to see it: create 2-3 indexes with baskets of different coins that you have held in the past, don't have more than 2 same coins per index

[02-Aug-18 08:54 PM] neokensou#2575
If there is no enemy, there is no questionable trade for a buyer because there is no competitors

[02-Aug-18 08:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im joking since i started talking about komodo name

[02-Aug-18 08:55 PM] neokensou#2575
so you dont need to split your buyers

[02-Aug-18 08:55 PM] neokensou#2575
oh, sorry

[02-Aug-18 08:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But if you see much of the topics these days on other coins communities its all about enemies

[02-Aug-18 08:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
our enemy is Wall Street üòâ

[02-Aug-18 08:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol

[02-Aug-18 08:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
At the current state of crypto... everyone has their asses lubed and gaping for some wall street

[02-Aug-18 08:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont know if you missed the memo

[02-Aug-18 08:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They dont even like anonymous devs these days üòÇüòÇ

[02-Aug-18 09:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
crypto is an addiction, the only place where you get upset for leaving $1M on the table selling 2-3 days earlier...  and don't bat an eye (a few months later) when you're down $30M for not having sold everything back then

[02-Aug-18 09:00 PM] snowdamn#2414

[02-Aug-18 09:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Did you heard that mom and pop dont like private keys?

[02-Aug-18 09:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
mom and pop will have to wait for old-school banks to offer wallets

[02-Aug-18 09:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Or for EOS fund freezing machine

[02-Aug-18 09:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Someone was shilling EOS to me thenother day

[02-Aug-18 09:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
siu + EOS = ‚ù§

[02-Aug-18 09:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
LOL

[02-Aug-18 09:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Those guys are all over where i live

[02-Aug-18 09:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im like the roach on the chicken party

[02-Aug-18 09:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"No tx fee" "fastest transaction times"

[02-Aug-18 09:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I added they definitively have the fastest freezing funds time in all crypto space

Fall 2017 is about to be repeated

[02-Aug-18 09:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
the pumps will be like fireworks

[02-Aug-18 09:21 PM] neokensou#2575
i pray for that

[02-Aug-18 09:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
they wouldn't have kept BTC at $7500 otherwise

[02-Aug-18 09:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
so unless BTC goes to $3000 expect fireworks
