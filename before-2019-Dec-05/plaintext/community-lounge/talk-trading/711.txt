[30-May-19 04:13 PM] Vertigo#0439
Last time BTC was at 9k alts were doing much better than this lol

[30-May-19 04:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
btc tx unconfirmed 2 hours and counting

[30-May-19 04:14 PM] Markus#5464
pretty sure ppl dont invest heavily into alts before btc is having a real correction

[30-May-19 04:15 PM] Markus#5464
we need a real pullback not a huge 4 hour wick

[30-May-19 04:15 PM] Vertigo#0439
I remember Komodo was arround 30k

[30-May-19 04:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362

or rewarding it

[30-May-19 04:29 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it rekt all shorts then all longs in 30 minutes!

[30-May-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
only leveraged ones

[30-May-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
crypto is volatile enough, why do people use leverage?

[30-May-19 04:29 PM] Markus#5464
wow it went to 8450 on bitmex 😄

[30-May-19 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why do people use leverage?`
Because when it works it's "better" to make gains off someone else's dime?

[30-May-19 04:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe when the leveraged trades are cleared out we can set sails to 10k

[30-May-19 04:31 PM] Markus#5464
is there somewhere where u can see liquidation price of every open contract on bitmex?

[30-May-19 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not sure

[30-May-19 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think there is a way on okex, not sure on bitmex

[30-May-19 05:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If someone would want to buy 25% of the supply

[30-May-19 05:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they wouldnt be as dumb  to start bragging about it

[30-May-19 05:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as that would inflate the price and make otc sellers more hesitant to sell to you at a lower price

[30-May-19 05:07 PM] hastrup#8742
@Cryptoon tru that

[30-May-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
they already bought 25%

[30-May-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[30-May-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
accumulation via OTC during bear

[30-May-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
now they need to 10x the price

[30-May-19 05:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or what jl said indeed

[30-May-19 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
Do it, Billionaires!  10x that price. I am ready.

[30-May-19 05:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Still, even during bear that would mean something along the lines of 15Billion needed if getting favorable deals

[30-May-19 05:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dont think a mere art dealer has that kind of cash? 😄

[30-May-19 05:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Otherwise I'm in the wrong business lol

[30-May-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the 100 billionaires the art dealer knows can easily have that much

[30-May-19 05:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD tanking again 😦

[30-May-19 05:10 PM] Markus#5464
question is why would someone who got that got such amount of btc sell it during a bear market, pretty sure they know better then selling at the lows when they could of sold during the highs

[30-May-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
TA

[30-May-19 05:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
