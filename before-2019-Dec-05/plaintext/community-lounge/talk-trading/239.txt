so they knowingly went after small business guys who are NOT suspected of any criminal activity

[21-Oct-18 05:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
they got him for structuring, genie, if i read it right.  so he made lots of deposits under 10k which is kind of how cash oriented businesses do it, if you are making weekly deposits

[21-Oct-18 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
so deposits over 10k are not allowed, but multiple deposits under 10k could also not be allowed.  screwed if you do, screwed if you dont

[21-Oct-18 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
but maybe we are back to your idea of dont use the banks.  stuff it all under the mattress.  heh.

`so they knowingly went after small business guys who are NOT suspected of any criminal activity`
More likely that a computer flagged the account and froze it before any human even knew about it (because it met the criteria of "known" illegal activity)

[21-Oct-18 05:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
possible.  but i encourage you to google civil asset forfeiture if you care to be disgusted.  Plenty of innocent people get caught up in it.

`ignorance of the law is no excuse`

[21-Oct-18 05:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
heh, yeah, i love that line.  There are literally more laws in the US than can be counted.  Literally, the government doesnt even keep track

[21-Oct-18 05:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
beejers and box munching are technically illegal in my state.  oral sex is considered sodomy and laws still exist prohibiting it

[21-Oct-18 05:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
my wife must have learned of those laws shortly after marrying me.  she is trying to stay compliant

what if I told you that the county you live in (if it has any court whatsoever) has books that you can avail yourself of and know what the laws are....

[21-Oct-18 05:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
i would be skeptical.  There are local ordinances, city ordinances, state laws, federal laws, overarching humanitarian laws

[21-Oct-18 05:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
lots of them contradict each other

[21-Oct-18 05:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
marijuana is a great example of this.  legal in some states, outlawed federally

Many Failed Efforts to Count Nation's Federal Criminal Laws
For decades, the task of counting the total number of federal criminal laws has bedeviled lawyers, academics and government officials.

[21-Oct-18 05:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
and that is just federal/criminal

[21-Oct-18 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
those entire nations must be criminals, otherwise why do they have cash??

[21-Oct-18 05:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
genie, you should let those folks at the WSJ know where that book is that you mentioned.

🤦🏼 

[21-Oct-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it basically means everybody is guilty

[21-Oct-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
especially if there are laws that make not doing something a crime

[21-Oct-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so just a matter to identify the criminal, find out what law they broke and throw the book at him. ouch

[21-Oct-18 05:24 PM] meatspoon#7860

the IRS is a great vehicle for that

[21-Oct-18 05:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
you get enough laws and you can make a criminal out of anyone

[21-Oct-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810

cash isnt illegal?

[21-Oct-18 05:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
my point is that there is no comprehensive book, genie.  if there were, counting the laws would be easy peasy

[21-Oct-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
is there a concept of common law ?

[21-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Oct-18 05:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
are you in Brazil, Emmanuel?  I would love to visit there someday, but life down there looks pretty dicey and dangerous these days

[21-Oct-18 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@meatspoon They take the words and they print them on paper (not even papyrus anymore) and then they bind those papers together. And if a new law is passed before a new "edition" of the book is bound, they bind the new papers together in this new invention called an "addendum"

[21-Oct-18 05:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
i would like to see Rio and Sao Paulo, but those are the dangerous spots

[21-Oct-18 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Oct-18 05:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
agreed that WSJ is compromised, but its a statist rag.  it does not serve their narative to show that the government is out of control

`genie, if what you were saying were even remotely true, the WSJ and other news outlets would not have a hard time counting the laws`

ahh, so Genie is right, there is a magic book that is up to date in every zip code that has all the laws in it.  DC lawyers, major print news, politicians, none of them can add

`some federal laws contradict each other`

well, now you want to make "book" plural?

[21-Oct-18 05:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
now your "book" is going to include all law books ever, genie?  lol
