A first (rough, pre-alpha) demo of the Binance Decentralized Exchange (DEX), showing issuing, listing and trading of tokens.  All cli based, no GUI yet.  A small step for #BinanceChain, a big step for #binance. https://t.co/2aXkR0gclP

the app is called hyper it seems?

[09-Aug-18 07:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
anyway, no way to see if they are actually using atomic swaps or whatever

[09-Aug-18 07:55 AM] Andersen#8337
Yes , in left corner  i see HYPER :trollface:

[09-Aug-18 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@hyperDEX you guys working with binance? ðŸ˜„

[09-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, they are trading bnb with xxx token

[09-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
bnb is ERC20, so kind of curious to see how they will trade it against a non erc20 token

[09-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Andersen#8337
xxx=KMD

[09-Aug-18 08:06 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
too little details yet

[09-Aug-18 08:06 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
we don't even know if it supports only erc20 or other coins, let alone which tech it uses

[09-Aug-18 08:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah for all we know it just has a centralized backbone

[09-Aug-18 08:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iâ€™d say the potential upside of buying KMD now vastly outweighs the downside

[09-Aug-18 08:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Much higher chance itâ€™ll be $10 than $0.10

[09-Aug-18 08:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

I told my mum to go all in the other day at 16k sat... just said to her not to put in any fiat

[09-Aug-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because BTC might still fall another 50%

[09-Aug-18 08:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think a lot of people are expecting it to go lower, I wonder if it spikes above 7k again if we will see a fomo effect or not

[09-Aug-18 08:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
Im gonna all in at $1.50kmd and its gonna drop sub $1

ETF crap is just manipulation by the news media.... I already posted the real news earlier today. ICE !

[09-Aug-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no need at all, for a ETF with the product they announced, that they own the NYSE !

[09-Aug-18 08:43 AM] snowdamn#2414
@blackjok3r read all such news as need for a dependable price feed, once they get it all products will be approved

[09-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Andersen#8337
Sure , just pump\dump

[09-Aug-18 08:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
I really need to plan out my exit plan this time LOL

[09-Aug-18 08:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
last years pump hodled 10 15x and all the way back down

[09-Aug-18 08:45 AM] snowdamn#2414
@Deleted User  do not exit at first re-test of ATHs

[09-Aug-18 08:45 AM] snowdamn#2414
if lower, fine

[09-Aug-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exit slowly on the way up, is my advice... I exited on the way down, slowly this time... stupid plan, but never lost any money.

[09-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Evitor#6985
I am Also thinking about Exot-Plan for next Bull run... @snowdamn how Do you mean: Do not exit at first retest of ATH?

[09-Aug-18 08:59 AM] snowdamn#2414
means if you stay in all the way to ATH levels you should aim higher

[09-Aug-18 08:59 AM] snowdamn#2414
if you exit on the way up, any point you feel comfortable with is fine

[09-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
The struggles of greed LOL

[09-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Cash out when enough to be financially stable for a while
Cash out when enough to buy a little house 
Cash out when enough for a big double story with cash to spare
Cash out at multi millions
Dont cash out

[09-Aug-18 09:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe I'll cash 10% out every time komodo goes up $10 ðŸ˜›

[09-Aug-18 09:07 AM] snowdamn#2414
also important to not change currency reference

[09-Aug-18 09:07 AM] snowdamn#2414
need to decide if exit plan is in $ or BTC or ...

[09-Aug-18 09:08 AM] snowdamn#2414
and stick to it

[09-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
btw I think at ath people will definetly cash out

[09-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
so maybe this will also be a great time for reentry

[09-Aug-18 09:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
or at least taking risks :p

[09-Aug-18 09:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
we ll see.. in 2019 ðŸ˜ƒ

[09-Aug-18 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
calendar of mmV2 and max postpone time of etf may be a sign

[09-Aug-18 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol

[09-Aug-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
I suggest exit is similar to entry, ie. not easy, unpredictable, impossible to be 100% correct. A cost averaging is known to be a good way to enter, so use the same method for exit. When accumulating, cost average. When divesting, also, cost average

[09-Aug-18 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
it all depends on what stash people got and what they perceive as profitable

[09-Aug-18 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
and what reasonable "moon" they estimate to be enough

[09-Aug-18 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and again I repeat that that stuff is not predictable, so dont bother to try

[09-Aug-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the hodl strategy works across bull/bear cycles

[09-Aug-18 09:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
that's what I do  ðŸ˜ƒ

[09-Aug-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so for those that cost averaged during the 2013 to 2015 period, then even now it is at significant profits. that is the point of hodl, to remove the timing aspect, so combine it with cost averaging.

[09-Aug-18 09:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, true

[09-Aug-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
say you put in $10,000 over 100 days, $100 per day 3 years ago

[09-Aug-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
now it should be worth $100,000+, so average out $100 per day

[09-Aug-18 09:14 AM] snowdamn#2414
@jl777c did you read about the crypto bank that will offer up to 15% APR on deposits? exactly the competition KMD needs for people to get it! ðŸ˜‰

[09-Aug-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it will take 3 years and sometimes when the bull comes back, you cant cash out fast enough that your marketvalue grows faster than you can withdraw

[09-Aug-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
that is called a good problem

[09-Aug-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
when you have sufficient fiat for the forseable future, stop

[09-Aug-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
@snowdamn no idea how any legit "bank" can offer 15% APR on deposits

[09-Aug-18 09:16 AM] snowdamn#2414
let me find the link

[09-Aug-18 09:17 AM] snowdamn#2414
probably with fine print...  "might lose everything, especially if rogue ITstaff empties wallets" lol

[09-Aug-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
more likely a ponzi scheme

[09-Aug-18 09:18 AM] snowdamn#2414
not exactly a bank, but you get my drift

[09-Aug-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
that is totally different

[09-Aug-18 09:19 AM] snowdamn#2414
i'd rather hodl the crypto myself and get the 5% APR directly (in more crypto)

[09-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
selling call options and calling the premium "interest" is totally disingenious,

[09-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
when you sell a call option, you sell the rights to the gains! so it if moons, you dont participate

[09-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
however, if it drops, you still get stuck with the loss.

[09-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is NOTHING at all like interest

[09-Aug-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
with interest, you still participate in the upside

[09-Aug-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but its regulated, so people will believe the nonsense

[09-Aug-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and when BTC moons and they find out they get their 16% but not the 300%...

[09-Aug-18 09:20 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, but more offers like these and better chances for people to get what KMD does ðŸ˜ƒ

[09-Aug-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
true. with KMD the 5% rewards dont require to you sell anything, and when it moons, you still participate

[09-Aug-18 09:25 AM] snowdamn#2414
and if stable mooning, very healthy yearly income (if enough accumulation)

[09-Aug-18 11:53 AM] devpro#1601

[09-Aug-18 12:27 PM] jr.trump#1045
I sell Pearl Pay ///  10 Pearl Pay - 1 KMD ///   I accept different offers for Pearl Pay /// Contact me by PM, I'm sure we reached an agreement

[09-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We can just buy prl on barterdex?

[09-Aug-18 12:33 PM] jr.trump#1045
When I have looked there is no way to sell or buy Pearl Pay if it is not from ICO

[09-Aug-18 12:34 PM] jr.trump#1045
I have of when the prices of the cryptocurrencies were higher, now they have gone down and I am not interested in having a cryptocurrency that even in a couple of months will not go to an exchanger as soon

[09-Aug-18 12:35 PM] jr.trump#1045
That's why I sell it cheaper than even in the private sale of the ICO that they are doing

[09-Aug-18 12:38 PM] jr.trump#1045
I bought more than $ 200 and now I sell it at $ 130, I think I offer a great opportunity for someone looking to invest in this project

[09-Aug-18 01:35 PM] Bittersweet#9376

[09-Aug-18 01:36 PM] Bittersweet#9376
