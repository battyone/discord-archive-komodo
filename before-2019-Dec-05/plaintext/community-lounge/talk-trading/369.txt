interesting point @actionslacks  - now tell me how many forks of BTC exist and if it is bad for BTC

[05-Jan-19 11:43 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
my claim - the more forks the better

[05-Jan-19 11:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also show me a "coin" that is worth  much less then one of its fork

can you show me at least one coin that was forked and is worth more then original coin ?

[05-Jan-19 11:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
"coin"

[05-Jan-19 11:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
bitcoin doesn't have a n atomic swap exchange, or rewards, or crypto conditions, etc

besides giving credit

[05-Jan-19 11:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
where credit is legally mandated by the MIT license

[05-Jan-19 11:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
credit which has not yet been given by a closed source project seeking to profit from said code

[05-Jan-19 12:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
There are two issues here... 1) the issue of credit being given and 2) the issue that there is a highly vocal member of this community who cant disagree without being a sarcastic, snide, insulting jerk when it isn’t at all necessary.  The first issue might be tricky to fix. The second issue isn’t.

[05-Jan-19 12:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
Every time there is a dust-up in this channel, literally every time, Genie is right in the middle of it rudely telling someone they are an idiot for not sharing his perspective.  The guy has never said something genuinely positive or uplifting to anyone. Its a bad look for the project, bad look for the community

Mining is just mining. Plenty of miners out there. You do it out of self interest.

You try to pretend you care about this project, but all you do is act like a repellent jerk in here. You are the most toxic personality type I have encountered in ALL of my discord channels.

[05-Jan-19 12:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
If I wanted to try and sabotage a community (of any kind), I would plop you and your infinite negativity into said community.

[05-Jan-19 12:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
isn't it a little too much ? CG is sarcastic sometimes, but I don't think he is toxic ...

[05-Jan-19 01:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have mixed it up with Genie a number of times and each time i get DM’s from people in support, saying the same things i say. They just arent interested in commenting publicly.

[05-Jan-19 01:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have had newcomers DM me saying he singlehandedly makes them less enthusiastic about KMD because they cant be a part of the conversation without him insulting them. Cant ask questions of comment because Genie craps all over them if they do.

[05-Jan-19 01:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
And of course there is a difference between sarcastic and snide. He is snide.  Non-native english speakers might not pick up on how rude he is being.

[05-Jan-19 01:08 PM] PHBA2061#2530
agree with you on the 2nd point though, I think CG need to restrain himself a little when discussing when newcomers in Discord

[05-Jan-19 01:15 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Is this the drama channel?

[05-Jan-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I, literally, can't think of a single time where a newcomer came in, asked a real question, and I "crapped all over them". I'm admittedly "pithy" with people that should know better, and that includes myself as well (if you haven't seen me self-disparaging, then you hanven't been in enough channels)

[05-Jan-19 01:16 PM] meatspoon#7860

To me it looks like KMD is just swinging with the alt-coin market right now. I think there's a lot of announcements forth coming over the next few quarters so that should hopefully create a lot more excitement for the traders.

everything looks like it's about to explode up tbh

[05-Jan-19 06:48 PM] ver_User#6608
with KMD, that spike of sells in the 25k zone... a lot of buying back will occur if we start moving up towards that

[05-Jan-19 07:18 PM] yorklab#7270
As someone who doesn't trade, I'm curious what indicators tell you it looks like it's about to explode up?

[05-Jan-19 08:08 PM] ver_User#6608
to be honest we are in a 5050 scenario as bitcoin is in an apex

[05-Jan-19 08:09 PM] ver_User#6608
I just liked the way it was behaving at the upper edge of the apex

[05-Jan-19 08:15 PM] ver_User#6608
I don't like posting charts from my tradeview account on here as it may help identify me, so I can try to explain. Bitcoin structure is in an apex, a constricting triangle with both up and down trends for the last days or so, ethusd is right at a longer term down trend line and should in theory be a place to drop from, KMD has been bouncing on support and volume has increased a little. Apex structure can generally break up or down, however the price behaviour, and traders behind it, to me, is bullish. Every dip is getting bought up on smaller time frames and despite being at resistance and any other number of factors for a bearish case, the price behaviour is holding itself up, very close to the resistance, not reacting and selling off as it should in theory. 

Now we could break down, but to me, we should have already broken down if we were, price is behaving in a way that it's less likely. I believed we would break down at first, but then upside, but the market is behaving like crypto does sometimes, and suddenly becomes more irrational obscenely favouring one direction, e.g. eth trend lately. The other thing is I've seen some reasonable volume sells on lower time frame, sellers are selling the resistance, but each is getting bought up. Could be a market maker making test sells or pushing us to break down... maybe volume will increase and we'll see. Either way next move will be larger IMO.

It's still almost a 5050 from here, I just like the upside, and if it is upside, it's set to be strong due to the shorts that will get stopped out and the buying back that will occur if we break up. Inverse goes for downside, however scope for a major new low is limited, 3k was the target for many, and 2nd chances will get bought up

[05-Jan-19 08:16 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
like it could go up or go down 5050? 😄

I try to be less biased

[05-Jan-19 08:18 PM] ver_User#6608
short answer is, I don't use indicators, I watch price and volume and structure/levels and I am bullish biased. Indicators are all made from price and volume anyway

you can redraw that upper trendline to make a new apex

[05-Jan-19 08:21 PM] ver_User#6608
that is the key break IMO, after that shorts are getting stopped

[05-Jan-19 08:21 PM] ver_User#6608
eth should be a major breakout

[05-Jan-19 08:26 PM] yorklab#7270
Thanks for the info. I have a more simplistic view. Until Komodo has something that creates more investor interest I think Bitcoin will dictate the direction, but I have no idea what that direction will be. The price of kmd has held to it's current level for a while so it could be the bottom....as long as bitcoin doesn't implode.

[05-Jan-19 08:28 PM] ver_User#6608
KMD seems to be it's own market though, it tolerated bitcoin's breakdown fairly well, but it had kind of bottomed out already

[05-Jan-19 08:28 PM] ver_User#6608
seems less correlated than other alts, many of which are almost copies of each other in price movement

[05-Jan-19 08:28 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, I agree. Lower volume could be part of that reason.

[05-Jan-19 08:30 PM] yorklab#7270

thanks for sharing

[05-Jan-19 10:21 PM] ver_User#6608
OK so... looking like it's not as I envisioned above, but as BTC starts selling you can see one of my other "predictions" amid the drama above ;)

looking at 3500 zone and up for btcusd, until earlier today this seemed more likely to me, so many longs to shake down, especially for eth too 

I just thought market was being irrational today, as crypto does sometimes. Generally it helps to have 2 scenarios in mind, and non traders will say that is so you can say "you are right", but it's so as not to be surprised when things don't go your way, and to moderate expectations of what is possible and probable


kind of annoying that I came in this channel to learn all about KMD price from the insiders, now I'm just writing my trading thoughts all the time and reading dramas not related to trading, haha ;)

cheers

[05-Jan-19 10:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, this is a very active discord.

[05-Jan-19 10:51 PM] yorklab#7270
Interesting to hear your views @ver_User regardless of the outcome. When Komodo starts making some noise, kmd will go in it's own direction for a while.

[05-Jan-19 11:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`As someone who doesn't trade, I'm curious what indicators tell you it looks like it's about to explode up?`
most often, self-fulfilling prophesies about what will happen when generally accepted indicators show something generally accepted

[05-Jan-19 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"everybody knows" that x will do y when z, so "everybody" sees x do y and starts trading in a manner that forces z

[05-Jan-19 11:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not always the case, but it seems more often than not

[05-Jan-19 11:59 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, I have always said that about TA/Charts also - self fulfilling prophecy -  If enough people are following the same chart then there's a good chance it will happen. I think it's much more difficult when the volume and price are low. That's why I was wondering if there was something else ver_User saw that made him think kmd was looking bullish at the time.

[06-Jan-19 12:14 AM] ver_User#6608
interestingly my bearish outlook was triggered by going into tradingview chat and seeing that almost everyone has lame upside charts, with that "knowing" certainty it's doing what they have drawn

so when "everybody knows" or everyone follows the same TA it actually breaks that particular TA method, and when everybody knows one thing, it's often the time to do the opposite... after all it's a fundamental law of nature that when is something at it's most extreme, that is the reversal point (after the darkest point of night it's going to get lighter etc). When literally everybody knows it's going up and the last person to want to buy has bought, there is nobody left to "know" anymore ;)

many indicators do actually show things like moving averages and you can read your tealeaves from those - mean regression, above or below averages = x, whatever you want. IMO most of that is clear without the indicator to tell you you are above an average or you are diverging etc

but yeah when buyers start outweighing sellers or vice versa, it makes patterns, and people see it whether they use indicators or price movements or whatever. I thought buyers were outweighing sellers, and they were, but on short time frame. 


BTC market structure has interesting behaviour and certain predictable indicators of sorts compared to other markets, but in the last year it's started being abused more by market makers and new algo trading. So when everybody does one thing, market maker/bigger players can use that to their advantage (if there are too many buyers at the moment, they can do some heavy selling to create a stop loss cascade and some short term panic exits/selling. Talk of manipulation has been since the beginning of BTC, and it's across all market, but whatever is going on on medium time frames in BTC (15min to hourly candles), it's grown up a bit

[06-Jan-19 12:16 AM] ver_User#6608
my outlook was based on BTC price action earlier, and how that might influence KMD, but it didn't play out from there. Hoping if BTC does go bear KMD just makes a big triangle with this level as floor

[06-Jan-19 02:20 AM] Likewise#6767
Indeed, doing the opposites of the crowd works great in most markets. Mind the haters though. Damn I got  bitched on for shorting since March. Even mentioning that 3200$ was in the cards got you banned lol. Oh well, guess who made money 😉
