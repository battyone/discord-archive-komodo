hmm... when this is settled a bit, I  want a really really vicious bashfest to trash up javascript ... at least three days üç∫ üç∫  üé† , where we can get creative about why it is a shitty language that sux big time and should be avoided for everything other than silly farm games and panda the pooh üêº (right, and don't forget a gazillion booking and dating sites üòÅ )

umm... any serious LISK bagholders around here ?!?!

[07-Jun-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the variable scoping is a bit lax

[07-Jun-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i know there are ways to make it less of an issue

[07-Jun-19 06:46 PM] tolken#2655
Needless to say, there‚Äôs an opportunity here for KMD to review their security process, which I‚Äôm sure they will. Most projects are likely susceptible to this sort of thing, but more stringent auditing seems like a necessity. It will come at an expense, but surely less than having something like this happen again.

[07-Jun-19 06:47 PM] tolken#2655
Maybe redfox will devise their own security audit on wallets.

[07-Jun-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, of course!

Indeed, rock on.

[07-Jun-19 06:59 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Someone replied to one of my comments on Reddit about the attack. Does anyone know the answer to this?

[07-Jun-19 06:59 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
the attacker published a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù package (electron-native-notify) to the npm registry, waited until it was in use by the target, and then updated it to include a malicious payload.
how did they update it?
‚Äã
the npm and github page for that package shows that it hasn't been updated since 2017
‚Äã
did they do a code hotswap? like a feature available to electron components?

Best  ever  marketing .  Hack  the hacker  :treasure:

[07-Jun-19 07:15 PM] LocoMB#8593
@ResoluteCrypto good question, that may lead to the thiefs trail ... (sorry I don't know the answer), but it will be really interesting if the thief left any traces

[07-Jun-19 07:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
it would be even more interesting to learn the sequence of events. was the exploit simply collecting keys and the hacker was waiting for the max amt of keys before attacking? did the exploit creator start moving funds as soon as the exploit was discovered? We'll likely never know if it was a coincidence that the attack commenced right after the antara announcement.

[07-Jun-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it appears that the hacker started moving funds as soon as he detected that we hacked him

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw a few stolen addresses that were one hour before our first sweep

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the house was indeed on fire

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and yes, he was waiting and had some large addresses pre-targeted. he didnt want to force a rollback (i think)

[07-Jun-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
very clever he is

that is some amazing marketing for Komodo

[07-Jun-19 07:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
indeed, if said hacker(s) actually get caught that would be pretty tremendous as well.

[07-Jun-19 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
Josh has a large following, and has never ever mentioned KMD before. This is the first time, so I imagine a lot of his followers are going to look us up

@ResoluteCrypto https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-native-notification is legit (atleast not malicious) the one that was used to attack agama was `electron-native-notify` notice "notification vs notify"
```
https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-native-notify was the malicious one

seems maybe binance got hacked for 700 btc?

[07-Jun-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
just a rumor about a strange transfer to coinbase

[07-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Bla5t_Tyrant#0494
They just posted message 7 min ago 3hr maintenance..

[07-Jun-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but "maintenance" started about an hour ago

[07-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*maintenance*

[07-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It all of a sudden just stopped trading and tradingview stopped printing candles

[07-Jun-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
hence the hack rumors as a 700btc tx was seen

[07-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And that was before the announceent

[07-Jun-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
some XRP wallet was also hacked

[07-Jun-19 09:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Binance needs to make enough money to survive a weekly 7000 btc hack, can they do it? üòõ

[07-Jun-19 09:03 PM] mrlynch#5735

[07-Jun-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810

[07-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
And poloniex stole 16% of their customers bitcoin who used lending.

[07-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Alexfrog#1338
(And when I try to avoid exchanges by withdrawing to Agama wallet, it isnt safe either).    Seriously, I just want to hodl crypto and not lose my coins, but its impossible.

[07-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Fortunately jl777 is a hero so that one will be ok

[07-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
(And others on KMD team as well im sure, also heroes)

[07-Jun-19 09:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
maybe a KMD Academy to teach users basic computer science and how to securely manage their own funds is in order

[07-Jun-19 09:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've heard cli is the next best thing when it comes to wallets

[07-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Using Agama was supposed to be securely managing one's funds though

[07-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Alexfrog#1338
anyway, jl777 and team saved the day this time

[07-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Alexfrog#1338
If this happened to most coins people would be so screwed

putting everything on paper wallets and just walking away for awhile seems like a good plan. but I keep thinking about them gains.
