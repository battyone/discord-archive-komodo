How many of those are dumbass stucks? I got stuck when I accidentally tried to swap with order I did myself. No wonder it got "stuck".  😉

Is there a way to prevent swapping with your own order?

[14-Sep-19 02:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That needs to be tweeted

To comment on my stuck swap - the team did review my case pretty quickly and are now working on getting it resolved.  This was my first swap and I understood the risks using a beta app, so I tested a small amount.  So not a huge deal.  However, hopefully the team makes it a priority to get the process of resolving a stuck swap automated.  Having to contact support in order to resolve a stuck swap kinda defeats the purpose of a DEX

I understand that it's an edge case, but it is a significant one especially if a lot of funds are involved
