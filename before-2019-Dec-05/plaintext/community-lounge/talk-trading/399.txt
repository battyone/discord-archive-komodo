Well I do somewhat agree with whoever it was talking yesterday about the whale leaving the buy wall at 18.5k, waiting for lots of sells to build in front of it, then he buys those up. That's a pretty good strategy

[05-Feb-19 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
one problem is that most people only *think* they are greedy and their short-term thoughts/plans/actions actually diminish long-term gains

[05-Feb-19 04:50 PM] Alecandro#1179
I agree

[05-Feb-19 04:51 PM] Markus#5464

I can't count how many times I've sold "at a loss" that lead to larger gains because of increased liquidity

[05-Feb-19 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
too many people get mentally married to a fixed price and that becomes a singular focal point

[05-Feb-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
>but I bought at 30k
>so what? you see it's dropping, dump some and buy more than you dump at the bottom

Everyone trading btt by looks of it

[05-Feb-19 06:02 PM] Markus#5464
insane volume on btt

[05-Feb-19 06:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah. Shame none of it is ppl buying the btt token to use it lol

[05-Feb-19 06:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Not that anyone needs it

[05-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Markus#5464
i was sceptical to buy it at 16 sats....were thinking of throwing 1 btc on it but decided to not take the risk....would of doubled it :/

[05-Feb-19 06:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Ifs and buts as always.

[05-Feb-19 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`Everyone trading btt by looks of it`
Not *everyone*, some of us are morally opposed to its mere existence

[05-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Markus#5464
ye

[05-Feb-19 06:05 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Insane walls either side of book. Too risky for me

[05-Feb-19 06:05 PM] Markus#5464
but im sure btt will come down, it seem to be overvalued at this point if u check supply of it

[05-Feb-19 06:05 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
For sure

[05-Feb-19 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`it seem to be overvalued at this point `
1 sat is overvalued

[05-Feb-19 06:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Whalebro must deff be a kmd fan to the core to have his order sat while others 'were' making gains on that btt.

[05-Feb-19 06:07 PM] Markus#5464
he thinks long term...just imagine gains he will have over next 2 years

[05-Feb-19 06:07 PM] Markus#5464
a person with such amount of btc knows how to manage his fund ^^

[05-Feb-19 06:07 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah 5% is 5% atleast the kmd stack is guaranteed to grow

[05-Feb-19 06:09 PM] Markus#5464
considering what kmd has to offer and upcoming development 10x from now should be guaranteed if ppl value tech

[05-Feb-19 06:09 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
10x pff im here till kmd atleast = eth 2017 游땍

What makes you assume that it was an either/or choice? 游뱡游낗

[05-Feb-19 06:10 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah he probs playing with more that 1 stack genie

[05-Feb-19 06:10 PM] Markus#5464
ye but my point was look at whale, he has like 7+ mil kmd, even 10x on that is insane

[05-Feb-19 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
whales aren't poor like us and can afford more than 1 trade at a time 游땥

[05-Feb-19 06:10 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What i would do for 7mill kmd 游뱂

[05-Feb-19 06:18 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
If she'll blow you for only 7 KMD, she's a whore; if she'll only blow you for 7 million KMD, she's an expensive whore.

[05-Feb-19 07:16 PM] jspook16#3059
I know it goes without saying but backing up keys is the first thing that needs to be done and encrypted.

[05-Feb-19 07:16 PM] Tek#5253
whats your recommendation for encryption

[05-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Tek#5253
can I make a encrypted usb with keepass?

[05-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Tek#5253
isn't it stupid to rely on keepass?

[05-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Lieutenant#1428
TrueCrypt

[05-Feb-19 07:25 PM] Lieutenant#1428
or VeraCrypt

[05-Feb-19 07:25 PM] Tek#5253
is my kmd key in ~/.zcash-params ? 游뱂

[05-Feb-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
I need to do a real walk through all my shit cause I got so much shit here I'm getting confused

[05-Feb-19 07:27 PM] Tek#5253
i'll just do a simple export key for now

[05-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
nvm my crypto folder has the seed

[05-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
all i need is the seed rite

[05-Feb-19 07:28 PM] PTYX#6840
Veracrypt is the most stable

[05-Feb-19 07:28 PM] PTYX#6840
Be careful with encrypted usbs. Make sure you have backups of the backup

[05-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
okai

[05-Feb-19 07:35 PM] Tek#5253
why

[05-Feb-19 07:35 PM] Tek#5253
sounds stupid

[05-Feb-19 07:36 PM] Tek#5253
isn't having the seed enough

[05-Feb-19 07:36 PM] Tek#5253
游뱂 it isn't?

[05-Feb-19 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`change addresses are stupid`
Actually they are 10000000000000000x smarter than repeatedly using the same address...

[05-Feb-19 07:37 PM] Tek#5253
I'll take a better backup later complete wallet backup , I only backed up seeds for now

[05-Feb-19 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_hasn't lost a single satoshi due to change addresses and has lost plenty in a repeatedly used addy_

[05-Feb-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
how did you lose funds from reusing address?

[05-Feb-19 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
because if I hadn't gotten into the shitty habit of reusing a single address the funds would have been on a different system and not on that win box that I infected

[05-Feb-19 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
they would have gotten a wallet.dat with 0 funds and the 29k would have been in a different wallet entirely
