I don't get it.  Greed and arrogance are nothing but destructive.

[15-Nov-18 07:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
BCH is whatever.   The only problem I have is the marketing drive to mislead people.   
Aside from that, everything was fine with their altcoin.

in seek of spotlight, didn't have much under BTC

just woke up, is faketoshi the supreme overlord of crypto yet?

[15-Nov-18 07:28 PM] cah5896#7669
What the hell is wrong with people in general? The stupidity that is in our politics right now is astounding, and now we have some idiot claiming to be Satoshi and ruining the entire crypto market? Are people getting dumber by the day?

moving that much funds, during an active hash war/hard fork, with no replay protection. That person is either very very smart or very very dumb

[15-Nov-18 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
and only a handful of people have that much BCH to move around. Sounds like it could be some strategic move, to maybe replay the transaction on other forks and try to dump all the coins, perhaps

I see a plot twist coming..

[15-Nov-18 07:46 PM] IndieBlock#3081
SV is tanking now... 48 hours time...

[15-Nov-18 07:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
3hrs ago, csw said he would dump if necessary. looks like he's losing the hash war

[15-Nov-18 07:46 PM] IndieBlock#3081
stats say otherwise ^

[15-Nov-18 07:46 PM] IndieBlock#3081
but *shrug*

[15-Nov-18 07:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
dump depends on CEXes

[15-Nov-18 07:47 PM] actionslacks#4072

CEXes need time to prepare for trading new pair

[15-Nov-18 07:48 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so no dump just after fork

[15-Nov-18 07:48 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
some time needed

[15-Nov-18 07:48 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe up to 24h

[15-Nov-18 07:48 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
best to wait most big CEXes ready üòÉ

[15-Nov-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
they are different forks, exact height of each is as irrelevant as it is for BTC height vs BCH

[15-Nov-18 07:48 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
1 guy on the live chat repeated what I suggested - one of strategy attack on price would be dump the other coin to lowest possible

[15-Nov-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the longer chain would have a higher chance of not being able to be reorged as deeply

[15-Nov-18 08:07 PM] Markus#5464
That 1,1m transaction doesnt that sound like bitmain? think i read somewhere that thats around how much they are holding

[15-Nov-18 08:25 PM] cah5896#7669
ABC should clearly win, they have closer to the original vision of bitcoin. Shame people listen to wolves in sheep's clothing like wright nowadays

[15-Nov-18 08:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
is this gonna happen every year now? like the superbowl?

[15-Nov-18 08:26 PM] Markus#5464
i think this is begin yet

[15-Nov-18 08:26 PM] Markus#5464
next days will be interesting

[15-Nov-18 08:27 PM] BlockTech#6895
Only 1 block ahead.

[15-Nov-18 08:28 PM] gigoplast#5562
why Komodo price didn't dig up in this 24 hours

[15-Nov-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Markus why would bitmain risk that amount of bch

[15-Nov-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When they also have significant cash holdings

[15-Nov-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And btc

[15-Nov-18 08:30 PM] Markus#5464
dont think we will ever get a answer on the transaction just a thought there is obviously a plan behind it ^^^

Not content with one already very centralised chain they have split into two very very centralised chains. Awesome work guys, you have created two forms of 'money' that are both even more centralised than fiat bankers could manage üëç

haha indeed

[15-Nov-18 08:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But

[15-Nov-18 08:33 PM] snowdamn#2414
BTC pump incoming ?

[15-Nov-18 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is the point atm? They both just mine their own chain? So they both exist?

[15-Nov-18 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just like the btc and bch fork?

[15-Nov-18 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is the endgame here that makes one coin ‚Äòstop‚Äô

[15-Nov-18 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Miners just give up?

[15-Nov-18 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So bch as we knew it

[15-Nov-18 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Can be spent on both chains?

[15-Nov-18 08:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its not like the bch you have is now bchabc and bchsv?

[15-Nov-18 08:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Like with btc/bch fork

[15-Nov-18 08:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon 2way replay protection is specifically not implemented

[15-Nov-18 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
not the same situation

[15-Nov-18 08:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
the object of the game is Only One Chain Leaves

[15-Nov-18 08:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is not the same as BTC/BCH split

[15-Nov-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
no replay protection and both chains hard forked

[15-Nov-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
BCH/BTC split was only BCH hard forking

[15-Nov-18 08:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's messier, more dangerous for average users

[15-Nov-18 08:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
don't use a fucking light wallet during all this, lulz

[15-Nov-18 08:37 PM] dukeleto#7326

[15-Nov-18 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So again

[15-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My question was what is the endgame?

[15-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How/when does it end? How/when is decided who wins?

[15-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
don't think anyone knows

[15-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because as long as this bs goes on nobody can spend their bch

[15-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
unprecedented

[15-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or should not spend it

[15-Nov-18 08:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The more I learn about this, the more retarded the situation seems...

[15-Nov-18 08:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So it‚Äôs just the chain that keeps being mined the longest and is the longest?

[15-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
Learn about core, you'll be amazed how retarded that situation was

[15-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
and is

[15-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So basically just a dick swining contest to see who has most mining power and who has the deepest pockets

[15-Nov-18 08:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Woops, sv went ahead

[15-Nov-18 08:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its like the world cup of crypto

[15-Nov-18 08:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes we do, it's called dPOW

[15-Nov-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt matter which chain is longer

[15-Nov-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
they both will exist

[15-Nov-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see either side stopping

[15-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So basically bch just became worthless then?

[15-Nov-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
of course using it becomes problematic as there is no replay protection

[15-Nov-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea what the market will do. maybe mcafee will tweet that one side won and it doubles in price

üòÇ (6) 

[15-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
I think we will have a clear loser

[15-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
think segwit2x

[15-Nov-18 08:46 PM] cah5896#7669
serves them right if it's worthless

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but the shorter chain can just stubbornly keep mining

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
segwit2x is probably still mined

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and diff adjustment (relatively fast) will make total chainwork different at the same height

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@cah5896 remember that the user/holder is the loser here

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Normale people like you and me trying to buy and use crypto

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We risk everything

[15-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
While I dont think ver/csw will go to bed hungry at the end of the day

[15-Nov-18 08:48 PM] cah5896#7669
@Cryptoon  I guess so. At least I don't own any!

[15-Nov-18 08:49 PM] cah5896#7669
BTC Cash seems like a flawed premise to begin with. I think Komodo is doing everything right. We just don't have many material gains yet

[15-Nov-18 08:49 PM] cah5896#7669
Well, we do, but compared to Cash we don't
