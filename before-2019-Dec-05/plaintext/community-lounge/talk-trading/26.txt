If BM had 1 trillion Sol/s, they still couldn't get more than 36.8% of mined KMD

However underrated you think komodo is, if you didnt know much about notaries yet let alone the other things they do

[27-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD is not their ico

[27-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
its probably 10x more undervalued than you already think

[27-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
To buy KMD means admitting fault and failure and dumping for kmd

[27-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Most donâ€™t do this

im more curious what crypto can do than just having it in your wallet

[27-Jun-18 01:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
buying more kmd is like buying more nose LOL. It never feels the same as the first thousand you bought, and no matter how much you chase that feeling, its never enough kmd ðŸ˜¢

[27-Jun-18 01:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies  have you looked on komodo reddit? ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Jun-18 01:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Il try find a few articles for you but kmd does a lot

[27-Jun-18 01:06 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
im not such a reddit person no

[27-Jun-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"didnt know how notaries work.. its like a secure node right?"
The shortest answer is that NNs record the block hash of a chain on a "more secure" chain and then record the hash value of that transaction on the original chain, creating a "checkpoint" from which all new blocks must come.
Over-simplified, but the basic premise

[27-Jun-18 01:07 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
cool ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Kmd is used for notarizations - other blockchains can pay a fee to be notarized/protected against 51% attacks
Komodo has a decentralized exchange (the best might I say) and to make 0 confirmation/instant trades, kmd can be used as collateral
5% per year reward for using kmd in agama wallet
Smart contracts/blockchain creation too I think?

[27-Jun-18 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Notaries are teh centrablized!!
