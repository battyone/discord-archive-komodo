The true leader will stop migration, make women have more babies and expand the empire organically

[11-Sep-19 01:10 PM] JimD#9272

[11-Sep-19 01:10 PM] Tek#5253

Maybe its not true in all countries but in America its horrible

[11-Sep-19 01:26 PM] JimD#9272
I know they are because the government policy is mixing because racism bad

[11-Sep-19 01:26 PM] JimD#9272
if everyone has no race then there is no racism

[11-Sep-19 01:27 PM] JimD#9272
Groups of people get wiped out all the time in history.  The strong dominate and the weak supplicate

[11-Sep-19 01:29 PM] JimD#9272
We shall see, but I don't think giving territory to migrants is a good idea

[11-Sep-19 01:29 PM] JimD#9272
but the corporate machine always needs more bodies

[11-Sep-19 01:29 PM] denio#8067
you are rly talking about human races?...i thought we germans were dumbass back in 1930....but some ppl in the us still believe that today ?ðŸ˜‚

[11-Sep-19 01:30 PM] Tek#5253
bruh you cant deny different groups of people have developed different features more or less

[11-Sep-19 01:30 PM] Tek#5253
so there are different races

[11-Sep-19 01:30 PM] denio#8067
cause you live here? and know it?

[11-Sep-19 01:30 PM] Tek#5253
saying there aren't different races is like saying there is only one type of dog

[11-Sep-19 01:30 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, Germans are just autistic.  They will follow any philosophy to the end

[11-Sep-19 01:30 PM] JimD#9272

[11-Sep-19 01:31 PM] JimD#9272
I think most of the stuff that actually matters is decided on the battlefield anyway

[11-Sep-19 01:32 PM] denio#8067
so you make a own study...with 2-3 germans?

[11-Sep-19 01:32 PM] denio#8067

[11-Sep-19 01:32 PM] JimD#9272
Could be but its either war or slavery

[11-Sep-19 01:32 PM] JimD#9272
