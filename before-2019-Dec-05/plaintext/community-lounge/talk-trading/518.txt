well a closed source project that was most likely pre-mined

[05-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
says a lot about a project but well who am I to question their authenticity

[05-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
meanwhile projects that have real value get blown away into sometimes oblivion.

[05-Apr-19 02:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
sad truth though, most people are in crypto space just for quick money  and could'nt care less about the fundamental tech

[05-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Indeed ..

Is VeriBlock‚Äôs ( $vbk ) Proof of Proof (PoP) really better than Komodo‚Äôs ( $kmd ) Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)? If yes, I would love to know the reason.

PS. I don‚Äôt have any of the bags yet.

[05-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you cant really compare the deaths of those that got hacked like cryptsy, etc, to bittrex and polo, which simply lost market share to binance

[05-Apr-19 04:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
One way or another they fade

[05-Apr-19 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326

`sshuttle --dns -vvr 1.2.3.4 0/0` proxies your entire internet on localhost thru 1.2.3.4 in both directions

$BTC Dominance 5.04 (1D)

‚óã Never in the history of $BTCUSD Dominance have we seen ranging between the 50% & 51% levels

‚óã Soon there will be a decision that will affect the entire market

‚óã Breach of 50% = altseason

‚óã Breach of 51% = BTC runs the show
