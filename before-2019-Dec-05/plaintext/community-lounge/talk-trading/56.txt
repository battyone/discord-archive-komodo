Also does this state the correct amount then @glx

[19-Jul-18 01:33 PM] glx#4214
@Cryptoon your vault is correct you received 1,000 free tokens. The Invite Friends page is old and I am updating today

[19-Jul-18 01:33 PM] glx#4214
@Cryptoon What is your name I tried searching cryptoon and could not find you

[19-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
search for toon üòÉ

[19-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just joined the group you mentioned

[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@glx so when i go to the page to accept the connection invite

[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I press accept then next, then I arrive at a blank page

[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
might be something to look into as well

[19-Jul-18 01:40 PM] glx#4214
@Cryptoon  - I will add that comment in the group now

[19-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also top right hand corner there is a green 3 next to the board

[19-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And I assume that is for notifications

[19-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But when I click it, it's not really clear what I'm supposed to look at after

[19-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or at least why the notifications were given

[19-Jul-18 01:46 PM] glx#4214
@Cryptoon - please drop this in the GLX group. We are collecting comments there. I will have some bonus for your efforts as a Bug Bounty helper

kmd y u drop again

[19-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Kmd breaking the rules, BTC üí§ kmd üíÄ

[19-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Like other alts

[19-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I don't like these rules

pump is over

[19-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There was a pump?

[19-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
At this rate KMD will be back to ICO by September

[19-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Incredible, but I guess that‚Äôs the nature of interest

[19-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Constant downward pressure

[19-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No buyers, price drops

[19-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And there really aren‚Äôt any buyers

[19-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Exchange accounts don‚Äôt account for much of anything

[19-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Coin supply wise

[19-Jul-18 05:51 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Well there is a nice saying i like using;

If you can't stand the heat.. stay out of the kitchen

[19-Jul-18 05:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
need to wait for at least $12k BTC for good alt action

[19-Jul-18 06:00 PM] crumb#2550
it's not just KMD today. most alts took a dive vs btc

[19-Jul-18 06:01 PM] crumb#2550
interesting timing tho. no sudden drop or spike in btc, but all of a sudden alts start bleeding

[19-Jul-18 06:03 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
As my part in kmd for my port is filled i start buying other coins.
Choice is ZEN, BTC, ETC ..
Wich one first? üòÅ

[19-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Acura#2748
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies Xspec

[19-Jul-18 07:30 PM] JimD#9272
@Acura Pretty sure Xspec is shit coin now

[19-Jul-18 07:31 PM] Acura#2748
undervalued like komodo - the tech is working, stealth staking comes also with Wallet V2 -

[19-Jul-18 07:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What the hell is xspec

[19-Jul-18 07:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Coin #8,932

[19-Jul-18 07:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Acura stealth staking much like Verus with staking?

[19-Jul-18 07:47 PM] Acura#2748

I will get ZEN BTC and ETC goals first... as i did with KMD.

[20-Jul-18 05:05 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Komodo has now dipped below my TA.  Anyone have ideas on a ‚Äúbottom‚Äù?  So many here were saying how closely KMD was linked to BTC price but clearly that isn‚Äôt the case.  Bitcoin is up like $1,000 and Komodo is down 15% lol.  Love the project but the current price is worrying

[20-Jul-18 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think in fiat its remaining somewhat stable, the BTC rise has made the sat value go down. Not really worried about short term, look at the historical chart on CMC, it got to about 17k sat last year and then went 10x.

[20-Jul-18 06:20 AM] Bittersweet#9376
@blackjok3r 10x fomo seems so far away

[20-Jul-18 06:30 AM] pinkolin#9557
üò¶

[20-Jul-18 06:30 AM] pinkolin#9557
Its not looking good

[20-Jul-18 06:32 AM] pinkolin#9557
For me it was about making more BTC, not $

[20-Jul-18 06:34 AM] pinkolin#9557
I dont see any KMD news for changing this sentiment

[20-Jul-18 06:35 AM] pinkolin#9557
But i‚Äôm still + in $

[20-Jul-18 06:55 AM] cheeweon#5786
@glx how can  i join ?

[20-Jul-18 06:59 AM] jeezy#3408
looks like my jokingly not so jokingly placed buy orders at 17777 are really getting filled

[20-Jul-18 06:59 AM] jeezy#3408
welp

[20-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Bittersweet#9376
What worries me is that after all this time there are still this many worried people

[20-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Bittersweet#9376
aka sellers

[20-Jul-18 07:11 AM] jeezy#3408
there are always worried sellers

[20-Jul-18 07:11 AM] jeezy#3408
at the bottom and at the top

[20-Jul-18 07:11 AM] jeezy#3408
lucky for us there are also hopeful buyers

[20-Jul-18 07:22 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Price can stay like this for a couple of months, I promise a nice buy in when my issues are dealt with üò¨

[20-Jul-18 07:22 AM] Bittersweet#9376
But I'm guessing most don't agree üòá

[20-Jul-18 07:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
A couple months I can live with

[20-Jul-18 08:05 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Now.. price back like before pump.. oh man oh man üòä

[20-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
This is OG profit territory

[20-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Unless you bought ICO, it‚Äôs panic hands chucklehead dumping

[20-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or notaries

[20-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or interest claiming

[20-Jul-18 09:08 AM] John Heldnik#0767
I think it is time to buy more Komodo's.

[20-Jul-18 09:11 AM] John Heldnik#0767
Strange to see BTC in the green and most altcoins in the red

[20-Jul-18 09:19 AM] Bittersweet#9376
It doesn't trickle down, it doesn't work :abusedsmily:

[20-Jul-18 09:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Eventually Komodo will stand on its own feet as does ethereum.

[20-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe

[20-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or it gets left behind

Well we dont know - if tomorrow and asteroid hits the earth üòõ

[20-Jul-18 10:30 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
then we are simply  dreamers

[20-Jul-18 10:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or the github gets scavenged and tech added to a popular coin with marketing :abusedsmily:

[20-Jul-18 10:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then all the twitter kvetching in the world won‚Äôt matter

[20-Jul-18 11:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
scavenging code is simple enough, but they'd be far behind in terms of infrastructure and understanding. There was one coin that tried, and failed miserably.

[20-Jul-18 11:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Time to buy kmd

[20-Jul-18 12:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
didnt we break lower bb?

[20-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
on the daily

[20-Jul-18 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[20-Jul-18 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
time to buy then

[20-Jul-18 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
everything below daily bb is way oversold

[20-Jul-18 12:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also more divergence on the daily

[20-Jul-18 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
once it closes again above daily bb it should get some traction

[20-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok

[20-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lets hope we dont see 17-18k first like last time

[20-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Was buying from 35k to 20k before we mooned for 80k

[20-Jul-18 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it might dump more before it triggers up

[20-Jul-18 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but definitively we are near a big bottom

[20-Jul-18 01:00 PM] yorklab#7270
```Or it gets left behind```
Been that way for a while now.

[20-Jul-18 01:02 PM] yorklab#7270
Just saw on twitter where someone owns KMD and had no idea it had tested more than 20k TPS. So not only does the world not know about Komodo, but even people who own it don't know much about it.
