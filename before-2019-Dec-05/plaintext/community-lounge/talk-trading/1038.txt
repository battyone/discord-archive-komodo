[07-Aug-19 04:16 PM] richardt#2807
Have a bag of KMD and didn't sell before rebrand.  Eff me again

[07-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Computer genie will dress himself into an unicorn suit, put a dildo on his forehead, and spread the word of KMD

ah yes, way better marketing than cute girls

[07-Aug-19 04:17 PM] richardt#2807
It seems no matter what I do, I'm wrong ðŸ˜„

[07-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Richardt, you should learn this

[07-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Caglio#3337
If something good is going to happen, sell before

[07-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Caglio#3337
However rebrand was fail, so yeah...

[07-Aug-19 04:18 PM] richardt#2807
But selling before for Dash rebrand was a bad choice

[07-Aug-19 04:18 PM] richardt#2807
Dash really blew up after rebrand

[07-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Tek#5253
Just wait until the masses start using crypto.

[07-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Tek#5253
they wont be using bitcoin

[07-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Tek#5253
I'm betting dash and bch

[07-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Tek#5253
will come out as the winrars of usage and eventually take over from corebutts

[07-Aug-19 04:21 PM] richardt#2807
The problem with KMD rebrand was that they didn't have any projects/companies lined up to use and/or invest in the tech

[07-Aug-19 04:21 PM] Markus#5464
what do u ppl even know about it?

[07-Aug-19 04:21 PM] Markus#5464
they clearly said that they have fortune 500 companies but cant announce anything or talk about it

[07-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Tek#5253
all I know is it went from cool unique sacred geonometry logo to generic powerbutton logo

[07-Aug-19 04:22 PM] richardt#2807
I figured if they did, the rebrand release would've been a good time to announce it

[07-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Markus#5464
nobody give a shit about logo

[07-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Markus#5464
means nothing

[07-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Tek#5253
and that's where you are wrong

[07-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Tek#5253
but you wouldn't understand cause you are a pleb investor

[07-Aug-19 04:22 PM] Markus#5464
how is tron's logo any better?

[07-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Markus#5464
its not

[07-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Tek#5253
lemme check the tron logo first

[07-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Tek#5253
tron logo has some geonometry in there

[07-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Markus#5464
bullshit ðŸ˜„

[07-Aug-19 04:23 PM] Tek#5253
not sure if its sacred

[07-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Markus#5464
either way nobody force anyone to invest or hold kmd, future will tell who were the real believers

[07-Aug-19 04:24 PM] Markus#5464
and had the balls to hold in situations like this

[07-Aug-19 04:25 PM] Markus#5464
will actually be rly interesting to see end of bull cycle where every project ppl cheer for gonna be

[07-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Markus#5464
pretty sure top 50 will look very different

[07-Aug-19 04:26 PM] richardt#2807
Top 50 coins will likely have a best marketing

[07-Aug-19 04:26 PM] richardt#2807
not just best tech

[07-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Markus#5464
ppl still dont get it

[07-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Markus#5464
why would kmd market anything in current market situation? what will it help?

[07-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Markus#5464
absolutely nothing

[07-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Markus#5464
its all about right moment and this is not it

[07-Aug-19 04:27 PM] richardt#2807
It's never the right moment, it seems

[07-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Markus#5464
why would it be right moment when alts get fucked? come on

[07-Aug-19 04:28 PM] richardt#2807
So you're right, maybe just not market anything ever

[07-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I have got the solution, look at my logo now ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Tek#5253
i do irc mode

[07-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Tek#5253
nice

[07-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Tek#5253
nice logo

[07-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Tek#5253
woud totally buy bc of logo

[07-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yea

[07-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Markus#5464
dont like, colors dont represent kmd at all

[07-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Buddz1993#5380
this is the rebrand logo 5.0

[07-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[07-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Buddz1993#5380

You Sir won.

[07-Aug-19 04:36 PM] richardt#2807
Antara release didn't even get an acknowledgement from AWS.  So much for being an advanced tech partner

[07-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[07-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Buddz1993#5380
True

[07-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Neko#5830
i think its going down because people still think its a zcash fork - which is also going down a lot

[07-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Buddz1993#5380
But my logo looks cool.

[07-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Oszy#5734
AWS holds half the internet can't expect them to acknowledge personally everything they host

[07-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Also good argument.

[07-Aug-19 04:39 PM] richardt#2807
I thought it is quite challenging to become an advance tech partner.

[07-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Markus#5464
kmd is the only advanced tech partner of any crypto project

[07-Aug-19 04:40 PM] richardt#2807
That's what I thought.  So Antara release should've been pretty significant.

[07-Aug-19 04:40 PM] richardt#2807
But perhaps crypto is still quite insignificant in the eyes of AWS

[07-Aug-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
i have a feeling kmd does not want to hype too much and that there is alot of info what they never mentioned to the public

[07-Aug-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
if u have the best tech ur definitely not stupid

[07-Aug-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
its a tactical move

[07-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Buddz1993#5380
When announcements come it will be like "release the kraken" !

[07-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Markus#5464
enough if we say it like this

[07-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Markus#5464
did kmd ever say something what never happened?

[07-Aug-19 04:42 PM] richardt#2807
Well, that's what we all hope and wait for

[07-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Markus#5464
alot of projects say they will do this and this

[07-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Markus#5464
i never saw this here

[07-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Markus#5464
all happened

[07-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Tek#5253

Dash having girls talking and promoting is just silly, kinda shows how desperate they are for cheap marketing

[07-Aug-19 04:44 PM] richardt#2807
And KMD has a bunch of nerds saying we have the best tech? ðŸ˜„

[07-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Tek#5253
a bunch of nerds who don't want to show face

[07-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Tek#5253
ðŸ˜‰

[07-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Markus#5464
why would u show ur face

[07-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Tek#5253
cuz im not a fucking loser nerd

[07-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Markus#5464
okay and ur point is?

[07-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Tek#5253
that I must repent, for not that which goes in the mouth defiles a person but what goes out of it

[07-Aug-19 04:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Iâ€™m pretty Public

[07-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Markus#5464
as a investor i dont see reason to show urself, its different if ur representing the project

[07-Aug-19 04:46 PM] Markus#5464
so with that said what i say is my own opinions and have nothing to do with kmd itself

[07-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Markus#5464
but i have learned that alot of ppl here have alot to learn

nothing wrong with staying anonymous

[07-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Tek#5253
you should look in the mirror, markus

[07-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Markus#5464
and i dont insult ppl on the internet who i dont know

[07-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Markus#5464
which is also quite silly
