Why are you selling KMD for OOT? To get a bit more than 2 x 2.4%, instead of 12 x (5.1% / 12)?

[26-Jan-19 10:24 AM] zatJUM#9924
It's not a troll, just a question!

@Deleted User ```KMD pamping nicely
Good opportunity to buy more OOT.
Last chances to buy at current giveaway prices, very probably.
Sell KMD -> buy OOT -> lock and get passive income.``` Why are you selling KMD for OOT? To get a bit more than 2 x 2.4%, instead of 12 x (5.1% / 12)?

I see that ARRR is soon to be listed on CryptoBridge...

[26-Jan-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because OOT is likely to hit 500 sats before KMD hits 38k ? @zatJUM

[26-Jan-19 01:02 PM] zatJUM#9924
Who knows? 😉

[26-Jan-19 01:04 PM] zatJUM#9924
If it's from this point of view, why locking them? Sell them @ 500 sats and buy KMD

[26-Jan-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the whole "locking" thing is a 1/2 mystery to me, so I have no speculation on that

[26-Jan-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[26-Jan-19 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They have been trading for a while around 200-300 sats

[26-Jan-19 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just wait for their platform to come online

[26-Jan-19 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If it gets traction 500sats will be peanuts

[26-Jan-19 02:41 PM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[26-Jan-19 04:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Kmdice might should be a good buy too at these prices

I am wondering if a lot of people are waiting for a last dump

[26-Jan-19 11:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Before they step back in

[26-Jan-19 11:31 PM] tolken#2655
Btc dump? Seems like it. All the ‘experts’ say its headed south.

@Lieutenant Just make sure you are in before marketing wakes up.

[27-Jan-19 01:29 AM] jspook16#3059
Where do you trade kmd like that?

[27-Jan-19 01:50 AM] PHBA2061#2530
and the 1% that doesn't work is me when I sell, true in 99% of cases 😭

[27-Jan-19 02:14 AM] yorklab#7270
@PHBA2061  -Yeah, same here so I don't trade, I hold.
@jspook16 I quoted what Lieutenant was saying. With my luck I would sell with 10% profit, only to watch it go up another 200%.

[27-Jan-19 02:38 AM] jspook16#3059

correlation != causation

[28-Jan-19 01:49 PM] yorklab#7270
@Deleted User That would assume that Whalebro knows BTC is about to make a move  which would be difficult to predict.

[28-Jan-19 01:50 PM] yorklab#7270
I actually never paid attention to the correlation before though, that is interesting.

It still all hinges on BTC. looks weak. About to break back to 3k retest. It will drag KMD down below the trend line, seems it's barely holding.

[28-Jan-19 03:18 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

[28-Jan-19 03:18 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
right now right on the 200 D,  there is a chance it will hold even though btc drops, I kinda doubt it though

[28-Jan-19 03:34 PM] Lieutenant#1428
cook your ass. there is a high probability 2500 BTC

[28-Jan-19 04:15 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Indeed I think we are about to see an ATL in the next days/weeks. BTC wise.

[28-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ATL would be zero tho :p

[28-Jan-19 04:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
