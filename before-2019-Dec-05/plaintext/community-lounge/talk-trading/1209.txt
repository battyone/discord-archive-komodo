Technically it would be the first that is not available as a natural resource. It may be semantics, but that's not extinct.

If the natural resources are depleted, price will go up, I agree on that!

nobody ever thought btc would hit 20k , silver is the next best thing to make money on

[14-Nov-19 05:01 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

[14-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Alltime low a couple sats I guess as there was no ico or anything

[14-Nov-19 07:56 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[14-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[14-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[14-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[14-Nov-19 08:02 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the onboarding platform legit?

[14-Nov-19 08:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes but it only has small amount... If you have problems let me know

[14-Nov-19 08:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Dr.Terminus altsbit.io and tradeogre are pretty legit

[14-Nov-19 08:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Altsbit.io is formerly known as digitalprice

Anyone think this could be an opportunity for crypto?

[14-Nov-19 08:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
for sure

[14-Nov-19 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think kmd was even accepted? Or was that for some camsite

[14-Nov-19 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cant remember

Chaturbate

[14-Nov-19 08:54 PM] phm87#7395
XVG paid a while ago to be used on pornhub. But it was not to pay girls but to let visitors pay abonnements wiyhout ads

[14-Nov-19 09:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes , they don‚Äôt do direct pay.  On chaturbate they just let you buy tokens with crypto

[14-Nov-19 09:23 PM] jspook16#3059
Maybe kmd can step in. We have the infrastructure to do it and it can peg to usd

[14-Nov-19 09:24 PM] CoinKing88#1540

nothing new üòÑ

[14-Nov-19 09:26 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Also: Vice calling it "to pull out" they must have laughed about that

[14-Nov-19 09:27 PM] jspook16#3059
It just seems like a good vacuum kmd can fill

[14-Nov-19 09:28 PM] CoinKing88#1540
It would but some would say a deal within that branche will scare off more customers than this will bring

[14-Nov-19 09:29 PM] jspook16#3059
Oh I see. The atmosphere is in question. Then maybe a solid asset chain so kmd isn't tainted lol

[14-Nov-19 09:29 PM] joe2x4#5987
Pirate and pornhub go hand in hand like peas and carrots.

Tittiecoin already exists if i remember right üòÑ

[14-Nov-19 09:30 PM] jspook16#3059
Well it's not a ph specific asset chain. It would be more of a merchant asset chain

[14-Nov-19 09:30 PM] jspook16#3059
Not just for ph

[14-Nov-19 09:31 PM] jspook16#3059
But for scenarios where payments are needed and banks won't support

[14-Nov-19 09:31 PM] Oszy#5734
the hard part is to get them to accept it, not creating the chain üòõ

[14-Nov-19 09:31 PM] Oszy#5734
hundreds tried it before :p

[14-Nov-19 09:31 PM] joe2x4#5987
But they couldn't get it up

[14-Nov-19 09:31 PM] Oszy#5734
literally

[14-Nov-19 09:31 PM] jspook16#3059
That's why I mentioned pegging to usd

[14-Nov-19 09:32 PM] joe2x4#5987
Sounds like some bdsm

[14-Nov-19 09:32 PM] jspook16#3059
It would be a go between. Just throwing ideas out

Penetrate the market

[14-Nov-19 09:32 PM] CoinKing88#1540
hard and penetrate in 1 sentence, i am proud of my brain :d

Pirates and peg legs go hand in hand like.....

[14-Nov-19 09:33 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll let it die then. Just thought it was worth mentioning

[14-Nov-19 09:35 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Well it's not a bad idea, actual real usecase. Those ppl need to be able to cash out their earnings. But might not be the smartest idea to tie up the name Komodo to that solution

[14-Nov-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
Before crypto, I try to launch a website to talk and discuss. It is a very competetitive market (SEO, SMA and so on), you have no idea how strong creators of such websites are

[14-Nov-19 09:37 PM] phm87#7395
one day, I saw one of these chat+cam website on sale, 2000 000 ‚Ç¨ for a website with good ROI, created 2 years ago by 2 guys. Technologically, there is nothing interesting. The huge part of the job is marketing (on a huge scale)

[14-Nov-19 09:37 PM] phm87#7395
I read a lot on blackhatworld forum (spam, no hacking)

[14-Nov-19 09:38 PM] phm87#7395
I build some linkedin and twitter bots at that time, it was fun. But some russian were able to control more than 1000 000 fake FB profiles

[14-Nov-19 09:38 PM] CoinKing88#1540
There is big money in that branche

[14-Nov-19 09:38 PM] phm87#7395
yes but honestly, I think that it is too competitive

[14-Nov-19 09:39 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Also stiff competition

[14-Nov-19 09:39 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Sorry ill stop with the word jokes üòÑ

[14-Nov-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
<warning do not buy shitwebsite>it can be easier to buy an existing website and add the coin (arrr, xvg or what you want). Edit: one example at 9000$, ROI of 1500$ per month. <https://flippa.com/10212894-best-niche-online-roi-in-6-months-with-guarantee> (but they don't say what you should do to get the traffic ^^ he he he) </warning>

mmhhh this conversation should belong to #talk-other-topics

[14-Nov-19 09:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I had a couple adult sites a long time ago.   SEO is a pain for them

[14-Nov-19 09:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Competing against sploggers ,  women who write damn near academic papers for toys or big pockets dominating adverts .

[14-Nov-19 09:57 PM] phm87#7395
At the end of my journey in SEO, I finally understood/accepted that only Google matters, this centralized decision is the only one that need to be changed. Huge unique content with added value is the best

[14-Nov-19 09:58 PM] jspook16#3059
Is the convo moving to #talk-other-topics ?

That would put kmd at roughly 1000 usd
