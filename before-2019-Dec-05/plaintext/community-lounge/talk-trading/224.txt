[17-Oct-18 12:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Hey if you send 1 kmd to 73Pi it will send 10,000 kmd back honest

[17-Oct-18 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So it's either cold storage

[17-Oct-18 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or megawhale

[17-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jorian#4555
maybe it's james securing future KMD payout

[17-Oct-18 12:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
James has no chicken tho

[17-Oct-18 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if megawhale makes an outgoing transaction, it might be best that you point all hashing power you have to kmd for a couple of minutes ðŸ˜„

[17-Oct-18 12:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think I sent some nxt to james once for shits and giggles... he kept it
