kmd trying really hard to be worth the same number of satoshis as btc is in dollars

[11-Jul-19 12:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
the real problem is that the institutional traders think that govt acceptance of Libra has something to do with crypto's value. so now everytime some corrupt mouthpiece hems and haws about libra, crypto valuation may be affected. i would be shocked if govt insiders weren't setting btc longs and shorts.

@richardt it will be the 16th for the aussies üòÑ

[11-Jul-19 03:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Whilst in the short term it sucks we are so low, just look through CMC and see how many useless projects there are and their valuations. Think of the day when they die out and KMD will still be kicking along.

[11-Jul-19 03:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We are in a transition phase where smart money is entering before the dumb money. They should look at FA more than TA and it only takes 1 to understand what KMD is building for the dragon to awaken.

btc up kmd down, btc down kmd down üòõ

[11-Jul-19 05:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
this is a pretty hefty shakeout across the board. looks like fear.

[11-Jul-19 05:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the Btc up down game is not done yet. when we'll see Btc dominance significantly down, then we can see where kmd goes. up or down. in my opinion, it won't be just kmd, and it will reflect to all alts in general, and that doesn't really make kmd an exception, since it technically being just another alt in the sea of cryptocurrencies.

5 days till beta release

[11-Jul-19 11:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think with KMD price as it is.......it can only go up or nothing as we have been only trading based on TA voodoo

[11-Jul-19 11:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I hardly think a revolutionary mobile DEX has been factored in by the market

[11-Jul-19 11:45 AM] Malti#3948
I see a constant that KMD is top performing when BTC takes a shit

[11-Jul-19 11:45 AM] Malti#3948
didn't really measure, but it seems t be there at the top gainers a lot lately

[11-Jul-19 11:46 AM] Malti#3948
it was nice to receive the mail with the news I was selected for the testing

[11-Jul-19 11:46 AM] Malti#3948

BTC dominance to 99%, then it all flows to alts, right?

Ark and Stratis also making some releases apparently

[11-Jul-19 01:36 PM] Malti#3948
just saw it in signal

[11-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Malti#3948
if the 1/tech rule applies we should only dump slightly

[11-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Malti#3948
as the antara/evolve campaign is focused on putting the word out on the existing tech

[11-Jul-19 02:02 PM] p.#1126
And it will be dumped for btc? :troll_thuglife:

[11-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

KMD will see it‚Äôs capitulation

[11-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
My guess is utility of the token will have to burn off all of the accumulated pessimism and defeat in the KMD sphere

[11-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Before a real rise can begin

[11-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Because what‚Äôs the knee jerk?  KMD rise, dump that shit

[11-Jul-19 02:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[11-Jul-19 02:15 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
