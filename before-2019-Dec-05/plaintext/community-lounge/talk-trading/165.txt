Hamlet should ask now "to buy or not to buy" 💀

[19-Sep-18 01:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
ATH is too far out in that graph 👎

[19-Sep-18 02:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
That’s crazy to imagine lol

[19-Sep-18 02:11 PM] Buddz1993#5380
1trillion would put Komodo roughy at what price 1000$ ?

[19-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Markus#5464
depends on supply of coins

[19-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Buddz1993#5380
By that time it would be 200 mil circulating supply or so no ?

[19-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
marketcap being 1 trillion with 200 mil supply would mean 1 coin is 5000$

[19-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Markus#5464
i mean nothing is impossible but that would be insane

[19-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It would be more y

[19-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
That would be crazy insane lol

[19-Sep-18 02:18 PM] ryman112#0068
Well I couldn't even fathom that

[19-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Imagining 5k usd Komodo lol

[19-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
If you have at least 1 k Komodo you would be a millionaire

[19-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Markus#5464

[19-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[19-Sep-18 02:19 PM] snowdamn#2414

[19-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Nothing is impossible tho .

[19-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
let’s aim for 10$ first 😂

[19-Sep-18 02:20 PM] ryman112#0068
That would be 5 million

[19-Sep-18 02:20 PM] ryman112#0068
With a 1000 dollar investment

[19-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
well nothing is impossible, look at ppl who bought btc when it was like 1$ and ppl barely knew what it was

💯 

[19-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Yep it’s too much money

[19-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Ofc I know but i guess we truly don’t know how market is gonna look like in 12 years time that’s for sure .

[19-Sep-18 02:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
$5000 will be like: they see me rollin' they hatin' 😀

[19-Sep-18 02:21 PM] ryman112#0068
My brain wont let me imagine that scenario

[19-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
And even if it happens I’m assuming usd dollars and most money as we know it would probably would be extinct .

[19-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
For crypto to hit 100T market cap .

[19-Sep-18 02:24 PM] ryman112#0068
I would pay my house off and chill.

[19-Sep-18 02:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
1000 is not far fetched by 2021

[19-Sep-18 02:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

Kmd is an exciting place to be during the crypto apocalypse.

How are p2sh scripts confirmed by the blockchain network?

[20-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is the entire raw script transmitted in the tx and verified?

[20-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I guess it has to be

[20-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is there a size limit to a script?

[20-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can you create an arbitrarily large script and overflow memory of miners

[20-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or would you be blacklisted past a certain size

[20-Sep-18 11:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don’t even know if I understand p2sh correctly, questions could be gibberish

[20-Sep-18 11:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@blackjok3r or @jl777c maybe

[20-Sep-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont know the answer to that really...there is a size limit on TX or blocks...

[20-Sep-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you modified code, it wouldnt let you submit one too large... and if you managed to broadcast it, no miners would mine it and it would just expire out of the mempool or never leave your nodes mempool at all.

[20-Sep-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you mined it yorself, you would fork.

[20-Sep-18 11:26 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Touché, I guess the whole script has to be on the chain, otherwise how would you verify past tx

[20-Sep-18 11:26 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
