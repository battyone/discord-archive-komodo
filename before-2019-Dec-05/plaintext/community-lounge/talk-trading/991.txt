Love the tech, love the idea of marketing, love that more people here understand that the lack of marketing is a serious issue

[01-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Caglio#3337
C is for cumdumpster marketing

[01-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Caglio#3337
@grumpygoron too bad the ones @ the top doesnt, we are barking at the moon

[01-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337
they still dont realize if they invent "coca cola" and noone hears about it

[01-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now I‚Äôm definitely going to a @Caglio KMD meetup

[01-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337

look at this fuckin garbage on cmc - I have mentioned this logo that has gone through a rendering gif program from 1999 twice now and it still got no acknowledgement: https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1521.png

[01-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@dan. that is pretty funny

[01-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 you are also welcome on our kmd meetup, so you can tell me how mental I am, and jerk off on your 20 cent coin

[01-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks exactly lol

[01-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Looks like something out of an inventory list from an NES game

[01-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Legacy of the Wizard perhaps

@dan. you‚Äôre talking about the clear white pixels around the logo on the dark background right?

[01-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
off topic. I played the shit out of that game when I was a kid.

[01-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I never could beat it

[01-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck that game

[01-Aug-19 03:09 PM] dan.#2473
@grumpygoron  correct. it is presumably an oversight as cmc is default white background

[01-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Took me weeks to figure out which character to use for which part of the dungeon. Almost gave up but did finally beat it.

[01-Aug-19 03:09 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Yeah but I‚Äôve seen you mention it.  Responses are like ‚Äúwell look at that other logo it‚Äôs bad too!‚Äù And nobody gets your point üòÇ I agree it‚Äôs frustrating

[01-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I used the girl for everything

[01-Aug-19 03:10 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Poor graphic design, but that happens when you copy another logo

[01-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sometimes the grandma who could float

[01-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The dinosaur thing was worthless

[01-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I was all about the dog to scout ahead then choose the character to do that part. Only the son could beat the boss though.

[01-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The dino was the family pet and monster didn't attack it.

[01-Aug-19 03:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio if you had buy when I was calling the little bounce you could have made your first kmd gains

[01-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs been 28 years or whatever it was :abusedsmily:

[01-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Forgive me

[01-Aug-19 03:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Probably not worth the 5 cents tgo

[01-Aug-19 03:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
You rather complain tho

[01-Aug-19 03:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
As usual

[01-Aug-19 03:13 PM] c2k#4915
instead of complaining about lack of or wrong marketing why dont u join the marketing team @Caglio ? my son complains about dumb stuff all the time but does nothing to take control and change what he doesnt like. im guessing your a early 20somethihng frustrated kid bc you never took control of your own future, but rather blame others for your situation or bad decisions. 

join the marketing team...make suggestions in #talk-marketing ...or just dump your KMD and move on to another project or the roulette wheel.

The fact I can remember the game shows that dementia hasn't set in yet.

[01-Aug-19 03:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[01-Aug-19 03:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not talk with me pls

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Caglio#3337
No no

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Caglio#3337
I should have buy and sell it right ?

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
You need doctor

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Markus#5464
most of ppl here should probably take a break from crypto and check back in 6 months, if kmd is not higher than today then u have the right to blaim

[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Or blackpill

[01-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Markus that already happened with me

[01-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Kitchen Table those brain cells fell victim to ethanol a long long time ago

[01-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
RIP

[01-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 I think ur just butthurt cos I am right

[01-Aug-19 03:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Nope wrong

[01-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
But honestly if you are gonna buy low sell high

[01-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
any coin is good for that

[01-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
its not called investing but trading

[01-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
I do not trade

[01-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
If I did, I could have tripled my money

[01-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Imagine if I sold at 7.5

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Caglio#3337
then bought back at 5.5

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Caglio#3337
sold at 6 again and bought in @ 4

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I think you will sell when kmd hits your break even 5 ( well done ) and then complain about too much and early marketing when you missed moon mission to 100

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Caglio#3337
that has nothing to do with coin tho

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's your character

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Can't Blame you really

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Caglio#3337
You are completely wrong

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Caglio#3337
I could sell this coin now while it still worths a buck

[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Cos its better to have 2000$ than 0

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Do it then and stop cry

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Caglio#3337
but if I did that, I wouldnt have any argument over people here who are defending stupid values

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Caglio#3337
So I will rather lose that amount of money, cos I already lost much more

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Won't miss your shit talk and wierd imagined sex stories

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Well my weird imagined sex stories are the closest u ever came to sex

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Caglio#3337
So I guess you will miss it

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hehe

[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ok

[01-Aug-19 03:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
@Caglio no amount of marketing is gonna get you the gains you seek. not in the timeframe you are thinking of anyway.

[01-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks I probably wouldnt say a shit if coin was stable, or having any gains

[01-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Caglio#3337
All it have is sinking

[01-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Caglio#3337
So we have a product now, we did "rebranding"

[01-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Caglio#3337
what are we waiting for now ?

[01-Aug-19 03:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
,,we ,, as if you contributed anything ??

[01-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Caglio#3337
Only 10k $

[01-Aug-19 03:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thx for contribution

[01-Aug-19 03:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
You are now entitled to nothing :)

[01-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Caglio#3337

@Caglio indeed

[01-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Caglio#3337
even bitcoin dark had more value than kmd now

[01-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Caglio#3337
hahahaha

[01-Aug-19 03:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
If your a gambler already, why are you so salty about losing money. Isn't that something you learned to deal with?

[01-Aug-19 03:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`even bitcoin dark had more value than kmd now` actually no, that picture was from 2014
