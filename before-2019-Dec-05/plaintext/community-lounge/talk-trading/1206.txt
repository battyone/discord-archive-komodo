Binance will perform a scheduled system upgrade starting at 2019/11/13 02:00 AM (UTC). The upgrade will take approximately 4-6 hours.

not related to KMD but the whole exchange....

[12-Nov-19 08:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We still under 1$ so dirtcheap tbh

[12-Nov-19 08:55 PM] CHMEX#0686
you can only change that by buying more

are claims payed automatically on Binance? I have my latest KMD still there too

[12-Nov-19 09:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes they distribute it each 4th or 5th of the month

[12-Nov-19 09:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
Nothing you need to do

[12-Nov-19 09:07 PM] CHMEX#0686
Dont expect the same as when you are in control

[12-Nov-19 09:07 PM] LocoMB#8593
usually I don't keep any funds on any exchanges.. so I'll prly withdraw it as soon as possible.. I'll lose a few days but then I can claim myself

[12-Nov-19 09:07 PM] CHMEX#0686

[12-Nov-19 09:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
Only works with a ledger and the seed never leaves the device so its considered safe

[12-Nov-19 09:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
Never enter your seed on a website!!

@CHMEX the site wants to claim to a new ‚Äúunused‚Äù address. How would one know if the new unused address is owned by the user claiming?

[12-Nov-19 10:36 PM] jspook16#3059
Pamping again?

[12-Nov-19 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
@tolken open the account in ledger live, select receive, note down the address

[12-Nov-19 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
that is the address it should try to claim to

[12-Nov-19 10:46 PM] tolken#2655

We are right now at same price point as in March 2017. From this price level  we had  our first pump and it became new support one that was start of huge bull run for rest of the year.

still no deposit/withdraw on binance

[13-Nov-19 10:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
they are awaiting network update later this month

[13-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
probably will open again the week after that or so?

[13-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think altsbit deposit/withdraw is open?

[13-Nov-19 11:04 AM] mosu#5812
upbit very cheap

[13-Nov-19 11:08 AM] cipi#4502
does upbit have deposits open? if so, then the price difference is because of that...
but if Binance does not open deposits/withdrawals soon, a lot of people will get into trouble
the mm2 nodes for example will soon run out of KMD and without withdrawals from Binance no possibility to reload them

[13-Nov-19 11:09 AM] Oszy#5734
here we go 11k

[13-Nov-19 11:11 AM] Oszy#5734
cipi reload from atomicdex there are real people selling not just LP's

[13-Nov-19 11:11 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Amazing pump

[13-Nov-19 11:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
upbit is disabled

[13-Nov-19 11:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
Temporarily suspended due to network upgrade

[13-Nov-19 11:11 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
No chill

[13-Nov-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@cipi why would they be in trouble?

[13-Nov-19 11:12 AM] cipi#4502
eg because they need to pay their bills

[13-Nov-19 11:12 AM] cipi#4502
or refill the mm2 nodes...

[13-Nov-19 11:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
but that would be a problem if they need to sell kmd right?

[13-Nov-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They could fund the KMD and buy it on binance and wait for it to open to withdraw

[13-Nov-19 11:14 AM] cipi#4502
or just tell Binance to reopen deposits and withdrawals...

[13-Nov-19 11:31 AM] mosu#5812
