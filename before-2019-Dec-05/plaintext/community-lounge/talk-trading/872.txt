[28-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Sdunbar#5064
better even to leave the room

[28-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Sdunbar#5064
or just not use it

[28-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Sdunbar#5064
denatures the molecules in the food anyways

[28-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Sdunbar#5064
harder for the body to process

[28-Jun-19 01:37 AM] Sdunbar#5064

[28-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i mean eventually one day im sure things will saturate to the point where we'll be entirely fucked

[28-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Sdunbar#5064
straw that broke the camels back and all that lol

[28-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Sdunbar#5064

@Deleted User I understand that. It is called a faraday cage. I dont think you read what I said. I dont appreciate you claiming I said something when I didnt either.
I'll  summarise what my thoughts for you again. If you think the addition of a 5G network and associated radiation is going to have a significant impact on our futile lives, more than the current amount of radiation is having on us, you're misguided.

[28-Jun-19 04:08 AM] tolken#2655
So uhh.... how about that Kmd?

[28-Jun-19 04:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's about to moon!

[28-Jun-19 04:56 AM] tolken#2655
According to CMC Kmd was $0.002143 USD in March 2017.:troll_compadre:

[28-Jun-19 05:09 AM] manugarc#3097
anyone from the team around here?

[28-Jun-19 05:09 AM] manugarc#3097
need assistance

[28-Jun-19 05:10 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I just did the math 😮 supernet is generating 1500 kmd a day with its holdings 😮

[28-Jun-19 05:28 AM] Markus#5464
thats pretty fine 👌

[28-Jun-19 05:28 AM] Markus#5464
547k a year

[28-Jun-19 05:28 AM] Markus#5464
compounding at its finest

[28-Jun-19 05:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
yes, but the other alts have better marketing

[28-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Markus#5464
cause they generated millions from icos?

[28-Jun-19 06:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah that probably helps

[28-Jun-19 06:23 AM] tolken#2655
quite a lul in crypto market after the recent bonanza

[28-Jun-19 06:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
it had to stop to breathe a little.

[28-Jun-19 06:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
should just ignore this market for awhile, trying to catch shooting rockets and falling knives hit my bags pretty hard last time.

[28-Jun-19 07:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@actionslacks marketing did not save eos with 4B

[28-Jun-19 07:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We need to get over this mentality that marketing will fix alts, real partnerships and real tech will win out in the end

[28-Jun-19 07:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Everyone in the community has a responsibility to themselves to go out and tell people about KMD if they want to move away this bot/TA trading environment we currently have to a more sustainable FA based market

[28-Jun-19 07:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Marketing is only a small % of brand awareness, the other major parts are a working product/tech and people spreading this by word of mouth.

[28-Jun-19 07:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If the marketing is failing, the community is failing to deliver. People need to take some responsibility for this failure as well, the question is will the community step up and fix it or procrastinate and complain?

[28-Jun-19 07:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If it is the former, great, we will be able to achieve great things together, if it is the latter, better sell now and head to greener alts like insight chain with 5x today on 5k volume.

[28-Jun-19 07:16 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Let's get real, even a 100m market cap is crazy for 90% of successful altcoin projects

[28-Jun-19 07:17 AM] Bittersweet#9376
That's not even talking about the worthless projects

[28-Jun-19 07:17 AM] Bittersweet#9376
i just think kmd (and co) is exceptional among all

[28-Jun-19 07:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586

Or Bitcoin Diamond Bitcoin Diamond 221M

[28-Jun-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or  Aurora at 175M

[28-Jun-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The answer is not marketing, the answer is pump and dump bots/teams

[28-Jun-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
How do we stop this? By having the market mature and only invested into coins that have FA/ tech and a future, not stuff that has nothing and gets pumped and dumped all the time.

[28-Jun-19 07:25 AM] Keppie#5156
All heavily premined aswell I think

[28-Jun-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Not necessarily, just big enough coins with ok liquidity that they can move up and down at will.

[28-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Keppie#5156
Noobs be like (wow its bitcoin, and its dirt cheap!)

[28-Jun-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
each pump of aurora brings in millions for whoever is doing it, then wait till it dumps then do it again

[28-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Keppie#5156
we should rename to Bitcoin Green

[28-Jun-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We should do a stock split 1KMD = 1000KMDs

[28-Jun-19 07:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Then we would be worth 0.001 and be really cheap

[28-Jun-19 07:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But then again this is what the appeal of these projects like tron are, they are cheap and they can pump on hype

[28-Jun-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But as the market matures, through every bull and bear market, they will slowly be weeded out

[28-Jun-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What will be left are the googles and amazons, not the pets.coms

[28-Jun-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Which project has the biggest market cap right now is thinking about this wrong, which projects will outlast and win is the right one.

[28-Jun-19 07:30 AM] Keppie#5156
This space is blinded by short term gains. Lets just win the long race & keep collecting rewards. We doing well

[28-Jun-19 07:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It takes a few BTC to drop 10%, it will take a few BTC to pump us 10%. The issue is not the price, the issue is real liquidity

[28-Jun-19 07:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I remember back in 2017, KMD had hundreds of BTC in buy support and there was 10-20bTC buys/sells and there wasnt too big of an issue

[28-Jun-19 07:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Markets moved slightly.

[28-Jun-19 07:39 AM] tolken#2655
@hyperDEX what I’m afraid of, is the Facebook affect. What do i mean by that? I think Facebook is and always has been a big steaming pile of shit. It was marketing and a bit of luck that helped it succeed. The tech wasn’t that impressive - but they’ve made it for the long haul.

[28-Jun-19 07:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But now with so many people looking for "returns" whilst shooting this space in the face by diverting funds and eye balls on great tech and FA, they have shifted everything to this tech is a hindrance mentality

[28-Jun-19 07:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@tolken that will only work in the short term, same goes for verge and all these other useless projects

[28-Jun-19 07:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Short term, easy to understand and pump vaporware does the best, in the long term they will fade away and when the market matures, the smart money will invest because of FA, because that is where the value is.

[28-Jun-19 07:41 AM] tolken#2655
But what about EOS, Cosmos, Tron... fake it till you make it!

[28-Jun-19 07:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Exactly

[28-Jun-19 07:41 AM] tolken#2655
Cardano

[28-Jun-19 07:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But do you think institutions will buy into it?

[28-Jun-19 07:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What is the risk reward there

[28-Jun-19 07:41 AM] tolken#2655
They’ll just use libra?

[28-Jun-19 07:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So this is why we need to position ourselves not for today/this year, but for the next 2-3 years.

[28-Jun-19 07:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just like what we did with DEX, it took 2 years to get it to a point where it works, now as KYC supernova is going to blow, we are ready to be that solution.

[28-Jun-19 07:44 AM] tolken#2655
True, seems Kmd is on the verge of showing the world real world use. I’m ready to get a bob setup with liquidity.

[28-Jun-19 07:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So whilst it may mean we are not the pump of the day nor do we have liquidity that can support our valuation (not many can), we need to build for not what the market wants or needs now, but what they will need in the future. DEX is the first, but smart contracts and smart chains and other things will be what people will be needing to solve their issues in a year or 2

[28-Jun-19 07:46 AM] tolken#2655
Hopefully the Antara release inspires people to use Kmd like never before and moves it from an enigma to an accessible suite of software.

[28-Jun-19 07:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think most are pinning too much hope on that. The thing that will take us up in valuation and actual usage to back it up is atomicDEX and having a very liquid DEX to boot. So how can the community help to make themselves rich? Provide liquidity, promote it on socials, speaks to friends, tell youtubers livestreaming about it, print out flyers and act like a crazy nutjob at work talking about it constantly....

[28-Jun-19 07:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Marketing may start with the marketing team but it does not stop there. The community needs to do it's part to spread the word.

[28-Jun-19 07:57 AM] tolken#2655
The only thing stopping BarterDex in the past was usability. Assuming it’s as solid as I hear, liquidity won’t be an issue.

[28-Jun-19 08:24 AM] mobipoi#5774
I agree with @hyperDEX  on this one DEX first, the most important need in the ecosystem, it just solves the needs of millions , DEX release should be priority, everything else is a prelude

[28-Jun-19 08:27 AM] mobipoi#5774
Without DEX it would be hard to grow the community very few people care about smart contracts and even fewer enterprise are thinking of their use case. Use case will come from within the ecosystem project launching on DEX /DICO etc

[28-Jun-19 08:29 AM] mobipoi#5774
It the only way to maintain and grom kmd valuation long term so what are we waiting for launch the dex already and we can evolve as we move along

[28-Jun-19 08:38 AM] alen#3721
Will it be possible to exchange coins a d tokens for stablecoins..i mean will stablecoins be included?

[28-Jun-19 08:39 AM] alen#3721
If yes...this is a winner....
We just use a crypto paycard with multiwallets and this really is a win win

[28-Jun-19 08:52 AM] alen#3721
How will it work regarding liquidity?
Will it be strictly one customer to another..one on one..
Or example..i want to exchanher 15btc for xxx  amount of kmd.... now: will you have to wait for one person who holds 15btc worth.of kmd and then exchange between them....
Or a better way...like torrent file sharing....there is not one on dex who jas 1btc worth kmd....can the dex work like...it finds 6 people who have summ of 15btc worth kmd and then the app  does exchange among them..
That would.solve a lot.

[28-Jun-19 08:55 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I read @Mylo is developing a marketmaker app, so you can easily setup liquidity. Parhaps he can explain

[28-Jun-19 09:01 AM] jansako#3330
The user experience is expected to be similar to a CEX. You see an order you can take it, or you post your own order and it gets matched.

[28-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah i might get started on it next month

[28-Jun-19 09:01 AM] jansako#3330
The difference is execution time, it will take a couple of minutes or so (block confirms)

[28-Jun-19 09:04 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the 0conf feature will be added again later, eventually it will be fast like mm1 but with better ux, and some stablecoins are supported

[28-Jun-19 09:04 AM] Mylo#8306
it's text based.

[28-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Mylo#8306
this is for the token DEX, not marketmaker.  marketmaker next month.  @jorian is making a prettier gui one atm

[28-Jun-19 09:05 AM] jansako#3330
Just so we are clear, the marketmaker app is a different beast form the trading UI for the general user pop.

[28-Jun-19 09:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
correct
