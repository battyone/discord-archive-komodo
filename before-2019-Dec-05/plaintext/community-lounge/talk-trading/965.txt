oh man @Tek is right. Dash is amazing! thanks for showing us all the way forward. I am honored that you have blessed me with your insight

[24-Jul-19 07:05 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
We probably in a longer accumulation phase for alts with alt season far away

[24-Jul-19 07:06 PM] Tek#5253
last shill line : dash has instant transactions, cheap transactions and is now more secure than bitcoin.

[24-Jul-19 07:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ahum

[24-Jul-19 07:06 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Bros just stop

[24-Jul-19 07:07 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Didn't want to start argumentation but when someone says dash sucks

[24-Jul-19 07:07 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's just retarded

[24-Jul-19 07:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I didnt say it sucks

[24-Jul-19 07:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@bopicasso you are wrong and it's reflected in dash price thank do more research

[24-Jul-19 07:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362

The enemy is traditional finance as a whole

[24-Jul-19 07:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Finance/monetary system

[24-Jul-19 07:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If other cryptos do good its all fine with me

[24-Jul-19 07:09 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Neverless we praise all institutional investments in hope they pump our bags

[24-Jul-19 07:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But sometimes we need to not take ourselves/our fav projects as the holy grail and see others as well

[24-Jul-19 07:09 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Cryptoonagreed

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] jansako#3330
I did not know there was an enemy, I thought we are just providing solutions to real problems... the best marketed solution then wins the most business...

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] jansako#3330
:troll_cool:

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But when people come saying in kmd discord of all places that kmd has no future etc

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Consider me triggered

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Nobody says this

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Tek#5253
nobody has even said that

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I think we all agree kmd is our favourite shitcoin

[24-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah.

[24-Jul-19 07:12 PM] Neko#5830
far from shitcoin

[24-Jul-19 07:13 PM] Neko#5830
it has way more tech and usecase than iota or stellar

[24-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Tek#5253
a real soy boy eats a vegan diet.

[24-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Tek#5253
and lots of soy

[24-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Tek#5253
at some point he'll develop manboobs, and maybe he can lactate from them too

[24-Jul-19 07:48 PM] Markus#5464
KMD for sure got a bright future, altho im not so confident that it will help the coin price

[24-Jul-19 07:51 PM] tolken#2655
I think it will. How much are other coins ‚Äòused‚Äô ? They generally aren‚Äôt, mostly just changing hands on a cex. When people use Komodo/Antara for real projects, there will be real demand and that demand will be the best form of marketing.

[24-Jul-19 07:53 PM] richardt#2807
How many real projects have come on board since Antara release?

[24-Jul-19 07:53 PM] Markus#5464
only demand for the coin i can see is for dpow and if price is 1$ like now then why not load up with a stash of kmd to do dpow for 10 years then ur good to go no need to buy more

[24-Jul-19 07:53 PM] Markus#5464
thats 3k kmd

[24-Jul-19 07:53 PM] Markus#5464
pretty cheap security for 10 years

[24-Jul-19 08:00 PM] Neko#5830

@Markus Did you want to try th desktop app?

[24-Jul-19 08:42 PM] Markus#5464
Sure

[24-Jul-19 09:23 PM] joe2x4#5987
Why keep money in bank like sucker? Buy Komodo, make 5% on your money.

[24-Jul-19 09:25 PM] joe2x4#5987
If you want to live comfortably, buy mountain of kmd and live off the interest

[24-Jul-19 09:28 PM] Caglio#3337
that 5% doesnt help you if you bought at 6.5$

[24-Jul-19 09:28 PM] Caglio#3337
Actually for that bs 5%

[24-Jul-19 09:28 PM] Caglio#3337
I lost 400%

[24-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Caglio#3337
Buy pile of kmd and pray to your god, or two headed cow

[24-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Caglio#3337
that it wont drop like it did

[24-Jul-19 09:29 PM] joe2x4#5987
Ok, XP user tell us how it's done.

[24-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I am just saying ur advice is great if komodo doesnt drop

[24-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Caglio#3337
I am telling u from experience

[24-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Caglio#3337
47000 satoshies

[24-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Caglio#3337
6.5 $

[24-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Caglio#3337
at 11000 satoshies and 1.15$

[24-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Caglio#3337
good 5$

[24-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Caglio#3337
if I bought a pile of it

[24-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Caglio#3337
I would murder someone rn

[24-Jul-19 09:31 PM] joe2x4#5987
When Komodo is back to $10 you can easily live on the interest of 50,000 kmd in most places on the planet.

[24-Jul-19 09:31 PM] Caglio#3337
IF is correct term

[24-Jul-19 09:32 PM] Caglio#3337
Not when

[24-Jul-19 09:32 PM] Caglio#3337
IF

[24-Jul-19 09:32 PM] Caglio#3337
If yes, I will be really happy

[24-Jul-19 09:32 PM] Caglio#3337
However its a gamble

[24-Jul-19 09:32 PM] Caglio#3337
And most of all probably a long term gamble

[24-Jul-19 09:33 PM] Caglio#3337
Hopefully I really think you are right, and if I havent thought like you do, I would never invest in it

[24-Jul-19 09:33 PM] Caglio#3337
But in reality, it gave losses to almost everyone, except ico price buyers... So either you are gonna trade and gamble, or hope it goes up, lately, it didnt... It grew up a bit in price, lost a lot in satoshi

[24-Jul-19 09:34 PM] joe2x4#5987
Drinking tertiary alcohol is a gamble, as little as 30 ml can kill you.

[24-Jul-19 09:34 PM] joe2x4#5987
But 10-15 ml will make you instantly drunk as shit for several hours

[24-Jul-19 09:35 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont understand what that has to do with komodo ?

[24-Jul-19 09:35 PM] Caglio#3337
5% on an unknown price is nothing, its a bullshit

[24-Jul-19 09:35 PM] joe2x4#5987
I like you, just sharing getting buzzed secrets

[24-Jul-19 09:35 PM] Caglio#3337
And I am sure many people that invested in KMD did it cos of that 5%

[24-Jul-19 09:36 PM] Caglio#3337
losses are much bigger than 5%

[24-Jul-19 09:36 PM] Caglio#3337
so your advice for someone, not to put money in bank, but rather gamble on KMD is really not a friendly advice

[24-Jul-19 09:36 PM] Caglio#3337
My 7000$ would be maybe 7100$ rn

[24-Jul-19 09:36 PM] Caglio#3337
but surely wouldnt be 2000$

[24-Jul-19 09:37 PM] Caglio#3337
so fuck kmd and its 5%

[24-Jul-19 09:37 PM] joe2x4#5987
I guess you are just doing it wrong. Supposed to buy low sell high. Not while high.

[24-Jul-19 09:37 PM] Caglio#3337
Dude

[24-Jul-19 09:37 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont want to sell, I just want my 5% right ?

[24-Jul-19 09:37 PM] Caglio#3337
When I put money in bank, I dont have to sell it and buy it
