[02-Apr-19 11:25 AM] jorian#4555
because of multiple resistances

[02-Apr-19 11:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
historically there never has been big support around these levels...

[02-Apr-19 11:25 AM] jorian#4555
but we broke through, unlike previous cycle

[02-Apr-19 11:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Apart from the range we have been trading at the past 2 months

[02-Apr-19 11:26 AM] jorian#4555
so james was right after all

[02-Apr-19 11:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Next horizontal support is 5700 usd ish

[02-Apr-19 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What?

[02-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Daily RSI approaching levels we havent seen since december '17 :p

[02-Apr-19 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
How are you saying that historically there has been no support at the 200sma in a weekly scale?

[02-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I said horizontal support not looking at moving averages

[02-Apr-19 11:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
RSI doesnt paint supports and resistances, it just paint the force in some moves

[02-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
RSI wasn't related to support statement

[02-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Was just surprised it was that high

[02-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and last time it was at these levels was the same momentum it had in dec 17

[02-Apr-19 11:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
look at how many times the daily RSI went above 80 during the bull market from 2015 onward

[02-Apr-19 11:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
One spike above 80 to then correct to 50 and start bouncing from there to 80 and back again is quite a good example of how an oscillator can help you follow the trend once its defined.

[02-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Junkie says this is it

[02-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
End of the rally

[02-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
reee

[02-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Death follows

[02-Apr-19 11:40 AM] Keppie#5156
Shhhh

[02-Apr-19 11:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you see the weekly chart, the picture is much different

[02-Apr-19 11:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So a pullback to 50 RSI is expected and mabye 4200 can become new support?

[02-Apr-19 11:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Look at how the weekly RSI bounced from above 50 for about 2 or 3 years

[02-Apr-19 11:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, if you look closely we are just testing the 41 ema in a weekly scale from below

I can see oscillations in price between 8ema and 41ema for some time before doing a crossover

[02-Apr-19 11:43 AM] Keppie#5156
Ta works until it doesn‚Äôt.

[02-Apr-19 11:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Look at KMD when it retested 41ema from below

sudden action on KMD

[02-Apr-19 12:04 PM] Tek#5253
I think that entire red candle is going to get eaten

[02-Apr-19 12:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This we just a retest of previous support. Ever new week needs to find these supports before gaining new grounds

[02-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Tek#5253
I had buy orders stacked from 26k sats all the way down to 24k sats

[02-Apr-19 12:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you notice, KMD has been riding the bollinger band ceilling from below for some weeks, It really wants to breakout into a new rally.

[02-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Tek#5253
I just guess where I put orders, it works out well

[02-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Tek#5253
so what should I put some sell orders at for kmd?

[02-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Tek#5253
I'm thinking 32k

[02-Apr-19 12:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Im not denying there can be some correction before heading higher, but dont put all your hopes on it.
