-10%

[30-Oct-19 12:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why do you do this to me @CHMEX

[30-Oct-19 12:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
Because OMG went -10% in fiat

[30-Oct-19 12:31 PM] CHMEX#0686
That is CN no?

[30-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362

OMG is very much overbought and uses Buterins hype who did not stop praising the project but this project is not unique in its way REDFOX from the Komodo ecosystem does all the same and maybe better just they dont have high-profile advisers like Buterin

[30-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I always thought they were a payment provider of sorts üòÇ

[30-Oct-19 03:27 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
if btc drops kmd needs to push against it to make sufficient gains

if btc follows the same wxyxz pattern as it did from 20k it will land back around 4k

[30-Oct-19 03:31 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

very complex combination of zigzags

[30-Oct-19 03:33 PM] Markus#5464
never been a fan of elliot waves

[30-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
im an expert in elliott waves, and trade by the rules

[30-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Flint#6435
the second chart is more likely

[30-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
and that what btc is working off, elliott waves

[30-Oct-19 03:35 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
kmd needs to follow my abc

[30-Oct-19 03:36 PM] Flint#6435
and if you tie the dominance of bitcoin to price movement? Where will we be when bitcoin touches 14000 again? and when will everyone merge altcoins again and run into bitcoin? We already passed it

[30-Oct-19 03:37 PM] Markus#5464
honestly so much shit can happen in crypto trading patterns can get invalidated in matter of minutes

[30-Oct-19 03:37 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i will give yu an example of where kmd is and what it has to do in reference to aud/nzd chart

we are at the circle example

[30-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Flint#6435
definitely you can definitely say only that the main trading volumes of Komodo paired with bitcoin and the dollar chart can not be looked at all

[30-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
oh yes it can

[30-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
im showing yu reference of what we need to happen

[30-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
otherwise the usd value is gonna cop a hit

[30-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Markus#5464
honestly i think whales make every bullish kmd pattern invalid to make ppl panic and sell them cheap coins and get rid of weak hands

[30-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Flint#6435
what can you say about the alleged bottom? if we already broke all levels?

[30-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i post my charts in good faith, take it or leave it

[30-Oct-19 03:42 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus  about whales and weak hands you just noticed! I always think about it when I see another dump

[30-Oct-19 03:42 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
the whole point of an inverted flat is to trap people to sell on the wrong side, so lets hope im rite

[30-Oct-19 03:42 PM] Markus#5464
Well its pretty clear when 90% of top 100 goes +20% and kmd goes +8%

[30-Oct-19 03:43 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
kmd is my only btc pair , i never touch them

[30-Oct-19 03:44 PM] Flint#6435
Do you think they are stealthily expanding their portfolio in this phase of consolidation?

[30-Oct-19 03:44 PM] Markus#5464
yes

[30-Oct-19 03:44 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i personally think btc will first of all come back to the 6400-700 support

[30-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
the alt dominance support is also minus 40%

[30-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Flint#6435
however, they do it carefully so as to prevent unnecessary buyers and not to raise the price too quickly to the point of non-return

heres alts chart clearly yu can see the support where i have the line area

[30-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i dont sit here and guess, heres proof of support, real support

[30-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Flint#6435
trading volumes indicate that there are practically no sellers, but buyers are not allowed to come back so that instead of KMD they buy shitcoins from China making from air + 30% and then they will be cut as always, when KMD starts to grow, then weak hands will go away

[30-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
dont worry komodo will one day be in the top 10

[30-Oct-19 03:49 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
let it get to around 8usd and watch peoples eyes open

[30-Oct-19 03:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Where do I sign

[30-Oct-19 03:52 PM] Flint#6435
yes, I completely agree with you, but before that we will see one bloody round of getting rid of weak hands and it seems to me that this will happen at $ 2 approximately then we will test maybe another $ 0.8 - this will be getting rid of weak hands and after that we can take and $ 8 and $ 80 for 5 years

[30-Oct-19 03:54 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
yes and i agree with you also

[30-Oct-19 03:54 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
its all part of the pattern

[30-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Flint#6435
I predict in dollars because it is generally difficult to make forecasts in bitcoin - we may not see the peak of bitcoin prices anymore, but this is not a cause for disappointment because bitcoin does not bring 5% reward to holders! And smart assets such as gold and stock markets are on the way - it will be exciting, but only strong nerves will tolerate it!

[30-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
anyway i dont really enter trading groups as such anymore so hopefully my input can help to some degree üòâ

[30-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Flint#6435
Do you remember when all altcoins fell or almost everything and KMD grew to $ 1.8 on July 8? despite the dominance of bitcoin

[30-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i remember buying kmd at 15 cents, and maybe yu are talking about when they did that broadcast

[30-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Flint#6435
we will overcome this maximum when stablecoins attached to KMD appear - not earlier I think

[30-Oct-19 04:03 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
its got me bamboozled why kmd is not paired already

[30-Oct-19 04:03 PM] Markus#5464
i have been talking about stable coin pairs since months üòÑ

[30-Oct-19 04:04 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully atomicdex will bring liquidity to stable coin orderbooks

[30-Oct-19 04:04 PM] Flint#6435
the most interesting thing is that since the beginning of ico, the asset is still profitable, unlike shitcoins that appeared at the same time!

[30-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
there is nothing like komodo on the market, and this is your second chance to ride it

[30-Oct-19 04:07 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
wont cost them much to push it, and they will push it

[30-Oct-19 04:08 PM] Flint#6435
Yes, we are all waiting for this! look at the clumsy ETH blockchain and it‚Äôs already blocked $ 600 million in DeFi smart contracts - this is MakerDAO
On Komodo's cutting-edge blockchain without gas fees, this will be fantastic for the industry

[30-Oct-19 04:10 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i dont think its worth shorting kmd down here, i personally would only buy more not sell, if we dropped an additional 30%

[30-Oct-19 04:11 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i only just re entered since we hit highs

[30-Oct-19 04:11 PM] Lanii#8302
You cant short kmd anywhere, can you?

[30-Oct-19 04:12 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i wouldnt short even if yu offered me double

[30-Oct-19 04:13 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
at this price double is not good enough

{Reactions}
‚òù üíØ 

[30-Oct-19 04:14 PM] Lanii#8302
I wouldnt short it here aswell however it is in a long term down trend

[30-Oct-19 04:14 PM] Flint#6435
I noticed the similarity of Komodo and QUTUM charts in a bitcoin pair, but with one difference - this is QUTUM's trading volume is 150 million with a capitalization of about the same - 150 million (though we saw a pump after the words of the Chinese secretary) and Komodo has a capitalization of 60 million and the volume is not exceeds 3 million so when big money comes here and those who accumulate in the consolidation zone will want to earn, then everyone will bite their elbows that bought shitcoins instead of kmd

[30-Oct-19 04:14 PM] Lanii#8302
so shorting is still the better r/r untill you get a higher tf reversal

[30-Oct-19 04:14 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
that why i say buy more minus 30% if it was to happen

[30-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Lanii#8302
People been saying "I wouldn't short it at these prices" since 10 dollars after nuke from 18 ish

[30-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
well i sold the highs

[30-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
and i enterd at 15 cents

[30-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Lanii#8302
you sold the highs?

[30-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
yes

[30-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Lanii#8302
How come you are not suggesting a change in Price action in order to buy

[30-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Lanii#8302
but you are throwing numbers as "buy if we drop 30%"

[30-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
when btc broke at ath i shorted

[30-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Lanii#8302
if you are a trader you don't enter positions blindly on how much they dumped

[30-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Lanii#8302
you enter at proper supports or dont enter at all

[30-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Flint#6435
Are you already driving a lamborghini?üòÅ

[30-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
these are entry prices where we are

[30-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Lanii#8302
and why is that

[30-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Lanii#8302
exactly?

[30-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Markus#5464
lambos are overrated haha

[30-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Lanii#8302
what has happend in price action that makes these prices good to enter

[30-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Lanii#8302
well besides from hard dump and hope

[30-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
let me tell yu no BS i didnt re enter komodo to trade it as such

[30-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i will hold komodo on a big range, i have plenty of other coins and stocks to trade

[30-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Markus#5464
@Lanii well imo, if u look at weekly chart u can see hard accumulation going on, price consolidating not much action going on

[30-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Flint#6435
if you are a trader then you still have to remember about 5% per annum multiplied by the additional volatility and growth of the asset in pair to the dollar! and then everything seems not so sad and worse than Amazon stocks

[30-Oct-19 04:19 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
regarding an entry well the chart in sats is demolished

[30-Oct-19 04:19 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus How are you spotting hard accumulation

[30-Oct-19 04:19 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
and he is correct accumilation is happening, i can vouch for that
