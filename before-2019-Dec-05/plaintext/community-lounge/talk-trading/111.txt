Could crypto conditions be used for derivative contracts like bitmex so there can be a decentralised bitmex  ?

Bitmex was on scheduled maintananxe

[22-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maintenance

[22-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
People complaining of liquidations are retarded

[22-Aug-18 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also iirc bitmex doesnt directly trade btc, but it trades futures

[22-Aug-18 02:29 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Did you even watch the video üòÇ

[22-Aug-18 02:43 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Because i think you don't understand the whole point mate.

[22-Aug-18 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I watched it, every time there is scheduled maintanance the price on coinbase pumps

[22-Aug-18 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And on other exchanges, causing liquidations

[22-Aug-18 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or that is what they imply and then imply that bitmex is the reason

[22-Aug-18 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And in the end imply that binance/bitfinex/bitmex all have the same people behind it etc

[22-Aug-18 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But what if some group of whales are exploiting the scheduled maintenances to do their pumps

[22-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I see there are also more maintenances, hitches with their trading engine where they report on on twitter that do not correlate with pumps/dumps

[22-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh as Siu also pointed out yesterday, the shorts were at all time high, so you could kind of expect this to be happening.

[22-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And there might be a group of whales behind it that rapes those shorts forcing them to liquidate and exploiting maintenance to do this, but then again

[22-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The squeeze was due

[22-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
He starts off the vid by telling that the movement up was very possible, but at the same time he says that it should not have happened, this sounds like someone that got REKT and is just butthurt tbh

[22-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There was a whale or group supporting the price around 6300-6400 for a couple of days now, people playing around with high leverage in any direction when there is no clear way up/down are just retarded

there is interesting youtube from Andreas about BTC ETF that is going to happen and the result of it. In the result big power over BTC will go to ETF manager, which means they will be able to make their own BTC fork and their fork will most probably will be valued more as there is more money behind ETF. Also it's possible they could try to influence BTC core to imeplement what they preffer. In the end it's possible the official BTC will be the one strongly connected with officials and controlled by regulators. Of course the other forks and other alts may exist. There is also space for gains for alts - as making official regulated BTC can also bring more money to alts.

@Cryptoon Bitmex&bitfinex worked together to conduct this pump. People were told to short before 23th because they think it will be rejected. Meanwhile bitfinex withdrawed 100million tether to their account. Pumped the price during the maintenance.

What is the upside for a scam like that? Make a few millions here and there from forced liquidations?

[22-Aug-18 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But what is a scam of that size came to light? The potential losses for those firms would be faaaaarrr bigger

Such a narrative of muh bitmex and finex scammed me just doesnt make sense

Proshares #Bitcoin $BTC #ETF denied, as expected.

Important to notice the #SEC argument for denial is not based on Bitcoin (on the contrary, it shows a very positive opinion on it) but instead on the manipulative exchange potential.

üö®ProShares ETF Deniedüö®

In a not so surprising move, the SEC has denied the proposed ProShares ETF, as we predicted would happen in our last post. 

The ProShares ETF is very different from the VanEck ETF. 

The primary reason, and why we think VanEck (due in September) has the best chance of success, is because VanEck intends on settling contracts with ‚Äúphysical‚Äù bitcoin (bitcoin actually owned to back the ETF).

ProShares, on the other hand, is playing around with leverage, on an already volatile asset, and is backed by Bitcoin futures (a 9 month old product). 

It really never had a shot.

Read more from the SEC here: https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2018/34-83912.pdf

Bitcoin has been extremely volatile as we suspected, it‚Äôs best to wait and see where the dust settles before rushing into any trading decisions.
