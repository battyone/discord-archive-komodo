I'm not a theologian, but I don't think trading is something that is very high up on the list of christian ethics..

[05-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
You are correct. Not just for Christians, any smart man knows that material gains are not eternal.

[05-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
However. without a decent pay check you wont really have time to serve the Lord.

[05-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
That's just how I see it.

[05-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
can't serve if you have to slave

[05-Sep-19 06:51 PM] Tek#5253
I don't trade anymore tho I just invest now.

I don't believe there is any investing going on , it's rather Gambling.

[05-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
For you.

[05-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
Then it is.

[05-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
Maybe you should stop gambling fren.

[05-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
You know the house always wins.

[05-Sep-19 06:54 PM] 𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™*#4914
Investing kind of implies that there is  something more concrete to it than just a currency , with tech no-one really understands and a Machine made to extract money from the masses. If you want to invest - build a bakery, be truthful and bake good bread and don't be greedy. You should be able to make a good living out of that.

[05-Sep-19 06:54 PM] Tek#5253
Dash is an investment.

[05-Sep-19 06:55 PM] Tek#5253
They have an investment fund. Dash is like a share. They will buy and sell land/companies/etc soon

[05-Sep-19 06:55 PM] Tek#5253
they also have a legal entitiy in australia

[05-Sep-19 06:55 PM] 𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™*#4914
You don't know what a few whales can do..  There isn't much certainty, to call it an investment really..

[05-Sep-19 06:56 PM] Tek#5253
I know what I'm doing. it's not gambling. its investment and funding

[05-Sep-19 06:56 PM] Tek#5253
how r the people going to build better money if no one funds ?

[05-Sep-19 06:58 PM] 𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™*#4914
Well, the best way is to get directly involved and build a company somehow involved in Dash's technology. Not just to buy coins and 99% of that goes to the pockets who bought years ago cheap.

[05-Sep-19 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah I have other goals right now. But maybe later.

[05-Sep-19 06:59 PM] 𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™*#4914
I know. It's hard and not anybody can go that way.

[05-Sep-19 06:59 PM] 𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™*#4914
I'm too lazy to be frank. Would be nice though..

[05-Sep-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253
I don't care enough to have much money to spend my time in setting up something.

[05-Sep-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
I care about my health more.

[05-Sep-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
Health, God, Wisdom

[05-Sep-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
Health and being focussed on a computer screen 10hours  a day doesn't go together well

[05-Sep-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
health and programming honestly don't go to gether well

[05-Sep-19 07:01 PM] Tek#5253
I rather develop myself instead of computer systems

[05-Sep-19 07:01 PM] Tek#5253
maybe that may change again some time later

[05-Sep-19 07:02 PM] Tek#5253
I hoenstly have it quite well. I so no reason why I should spend years of hard work setting up a company at this time in my life

[06-Sep-19 01:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if btc dominance really goes to 80%, I doubt we found bottom on kmd

[06-Sep-19 03:04 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I don't believe 80% is realistic. Yes, it's possible, but not realistic imho. There are over 1k coins more than it was in 2017. So where are you going to get that extra 9%? Really, only top 30-50 coins are left with enough mcap to get meaningful amount of domination. Most of everything else is sucked dry already.

[06-Sep-19 03:13 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
and we have many stablecoins too. Can't get any btc dominance out of them.

[06-Sep-19 03:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
this is still the wild west. and if you're sweating 50% losses it just shows how new you are. I don't beleive in tea leaves because humans are not rational beings. this is a powder keg set to explode. If and when atomic dex goes viral. It will indeed explode.

[06-Sep-19 03:52 AM] actionslacks#4072

[06-Sep-19 09:06 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I'm about -75% with kmd, but of course even more with many other coins. Top 20 coins takes about 90% of altcoin dominance. It's hard to imagine that kmd would lose another 50% in the same time as other coins would lose average 9% more to get 80% btc dominance.

[06-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
not realistic.

get woke, the shit has only begun

[06-Sep-19 09:11 AM] Oszy#5734
the *coin era 😄

[06-Sep-19 09:13 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
if eth would lose another 30% to 0.01 btc. It would be only $2b and we would need another $23b to get 80%, minus stablecoins. So, 80% is not easy to reach unless top 10 coins lose a lot of value vs btc.

[06-Sep-19 09:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
that was cmc 3 years ago. think about 3 yrs from now

[06-Sep-19 09:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
you're missing the forest for the trees

[06-Sep-19 09:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Patrick Friggens  you are assuming that there is 270B in the markets

[06-Sep-19 09:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also assuming, no possibility that more fiat can enter in crypto market

[06-Sep-19 09:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If someone injects 100M into BTC and it moves the price $200, then all the alts go up in USD, that 100M might add 1-2B

[06-Sep-19 09:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But in the reverse direction is true too

[06-Sep-19 09:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I would say there might be less than 50B in actual funds/liquidity

[06-Sep-19 09:24 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
yes, I assumed 270b. Of course, if more outside money comes in. That would make it easier.

[06-Sep-19 09:24 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
and if it only goes to btc.

[06-Sep-19 09:25 AM] Oszy#5734

this whole technology and market has too many moving parts to be coherent anyway-
look at shit like EOS, DASH, TRON and all that- and even ETH will not live up to its promises, imo - but shenanigans like EOS is where the money is,
and outgrowing this will just take time

[06-Sep-19 09:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
He just needs to market buy the 150k at 8k

[06-Sep-19 09:31 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
According to cmc, roughly half of coins have zero trading volume 24h. It's not accurate of course, but suggests many that there are lots of dead coins already.

[06-Sep-19 09:31 AM] LocoMB#8593

[06-Sep-19 10:12 AM] sφldat#8733
Big fees too

[06-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Oszy#5734
700 usd fee is not that big for a billion tx i'd happy to pay it

[06-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Oszy#5734
wonder how much would that be if it's a bank transfer 🤔

[06-Sep-19 10:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Wow there is 47BTC buy down to 6k

[06-Sep-19 10:24 AM] sφldat#8733
Of course @Oszy a bank takes 0.5/2% but it's just big fees for Btc tx

[06-Sep-19 10:28 AM] Oszy#5734
in % terms it's still acceptable (on my end)

[06-Sep-19 10:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
