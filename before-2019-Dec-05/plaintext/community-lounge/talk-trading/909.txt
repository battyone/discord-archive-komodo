Bitcoin and blockchain are neither ideal technologies for decentralization nor gambling by crooks seeking a fortune. It is the power to monitor and control the flow of money around the world, and the means to control the new empire.

`and control the flow of money`
What if I told you that Bitcoin is supposed to be exactly *not* that....

[11-Jul-19 04:59 PM] cipi#4502
bots usually act as marketmaker, they only post orders in the orderbook, they don't fill them... so the price is not made by the bots

[11-Jul-19 05:15 PM] Bittersweet#9376
It's cool to see kmd and lsk at same mcap, considering the hype they had

[11-Jul-19 05:39 PM] c2k#4915
@cipi why do you say the bots only post bids and offers but never get filled?

[11-Jul-19 05:42 PM] cipi#4502
i meant they don't actively fill orders, they are waiting for others to fill them...  that is the way i do it, but i think most other bots do the same

[11-Jul-19 05:46 PM] c2k#4915
ok, just trying to understand how it works in crypto bots.
so youre saying theyre passive?...sit on the bid and wait to be hit or sit on the offer and wait to be lifted, but never actually cross the spread and "cause" the trade?

[11-Jul-19 05:46 PM] cipi#4502
@c2k  yes, exactly

[11-Jul-19 05:48 PM] c2k#4915
in equities bots act similarly, especially in tight spreads, because the ECN's pay them to provide liquidity. IE, a "maker" who provides liquidity gets paid ~0.002 while a "taker" of liquidity has to pay ~0.003 .

[11-Jul-19 05:49 PM] c2k#4915
but a liquidity provider in crypto doesnt get "paid" a rebate for providing that liquidity, correct?

[11-Jul-19 05:49 PM] c2k#4915
@cipi

[11-Jul-19 05:50 PM] cipi#4502
no, Binance doesn't pay the makers, the only difference is that you pay a smaller fee as a maker

[11-Jul-19 05:50 PM] c2k#4915

I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....

@realDonaldTrump Donald, the USD is the largest enabler of illicit transactions and activities in the world.  

Bitcoin is actually terrible for these purposes, as all transactions are recorded on a public ledger, forever, with 1000's of backups around the world.

SAD!!!
