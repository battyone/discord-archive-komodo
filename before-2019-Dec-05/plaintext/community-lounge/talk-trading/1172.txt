America was conquered in 1913 with the installation of the central bank and then they bought up all the assets during the depression

John Lydon says he will 'sorely miss' the Queen when she is gone
Man who castigated the monarchy in 1977 single God Save the Queen says he will miss the Queen ‘as a human being’, and that he loves royal pageantry

if it drops under that than I think we are in trouble

[16-Oct-19 09:25 PM] jorian#4555
KMD probably going to double-down when that happens

[16-Oct-19 09:25 PM] jorian#4555
$0.27 real bottom? 😬

[16-Oct-19 09:26 PM] jorian#4555
although there has been plenty buying right now, so i doubt it will happen

[16-Oct-19 09:58 PM] JimD#9272
BTC is gonna be at 5K if KMD is .27$

[16-Oct-19 10:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530
question is, if btc double up from here like that 4chan's prediction, will kmd go up or down ? :abusedsmily:

[16-Oct-19 10:48 PM] bishop#9773
Down, obviously

[17-Oct-19 03:33 AM] jspook16#3059
down

[17-Oct-19 03:44 AM] richardt#2807
For sure down.  Hardly anybody cares about alts right now.  Anyone who does is just a bagholder 😄

`Synthetix is a decentralised synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum` i've read enough, moving on...

it doesn't matter that it's build on eth

[17-Oct-19 03:26 PM] jorian#4555
what matters is that apparently there's an investor investing in the kind of stuff that KMD has the tech for

[17-Oct-19 03:27 PM] jorian#4555
i mean: has the **better** tech for

[17-Oct-19 03:32 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, and then the Q becomes: _when_ will said investor become aware of  this embarassing circumstance??

[17-Oct-19 03:49 PM] KTnoc#4131
market it ?

[17-Oct-19 04:10 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
It is mind-boggling, the degree to which the reinvention of the wheel is repeated and *funded* in this space.

[17-Oct-19 04:17 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
And it is frustrating to see dismal designs get massive funding, and use that money to stay relevant, based on what I think is an underlying idea that money will solve the problems.  EOS is an example.

[17-Oct-19 04:18 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
Question is how long can they keep that bubble inflated?

[17-Oct-19 04:21 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
Even supposed big enterprise partnerships, which on the surface appear to be about adoption, I suspect are quietly about speculation & PR.  When global circumstances and tech advancements finally drive enterprises towards adopting public DLT for real uses, then is the best chance of bubbles popping as the world discovers which platforms are BS and which are viable.

[17-Oct-19 04:22 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
Until then, it's "pie in the sky"

[17-Oct-19 04:26 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
I think one of the best things a decent project can focus on right now is interoperability.  In this way platforms can extend their reach and better provide those niche characteristics they're most valued for, and be relevant in the future.

[17-Oct-19 04:29 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
And never forget that every good project is someone else's "shitcoin".

[17-Oct-19 05:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
The professional bs artists are in their element with the state of normie crypto awareness. The lies are so pervasive and well supported that you could tell an investor whatever you want and thousands of other shills will follow right along. Real implementation is being hampered mostly by govt thugs going around bashing the kneecaps of anyone trying to do anything without the blessing of the banker overlords.

[17-Oct-19 05:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
Any recent rektage will pale in comparison to whats coming when these slapped together projects face real usage.

komodo now reminds me of monero in 2016, good tech and community but ignored by the markets, at the time it took a major dnm adopting it for it to finally fly, I reckon komodo will need some significative adoption news

I bought at 6 cents,  sold at 24 cents

[17-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Privatoshi#9487

Its a popular DeFi project, which is what is popular with Eth, at the moment

[17-Oct-19 06:40 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I think the Andreesen Horowitz bit, was bullshit.

[17-Oct-19 06:41 PM] Privatoshi#9487
But, if you make a grid of the top 50 CMC, and who isn't on Binance, that makes a really short list. 

My bet, SNX, Binance Listing.
Binance Info gave it an A+, several months ago.

[17-Oct-19 06:43 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm sure more than a few in SNX Community, hold more than 500 BNB, to vote.

Ya, was really wondering if the bull market was already over and we have to wait for another bloodbath before buying back in

[17-Oct-19 07:49 PM] JimD#9272
Not near as steep from the high this time though

[17-Oct-19 07:49 PM] JimD#9272
If you draw out the mega wedge from the past 2 years BTC goes to 5300 ish
