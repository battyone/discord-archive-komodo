and they will push 5G

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] Tek#5253
wether you like it or not

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
just because you can make conditions perfect to send one gigameg block, doesn't mean it's a good idea to allow them all the time

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
i can attack your coin with gigameg blocks

[30-May-19 05:27 AM] Tek#5253
gigameg :

BSV is below me

[30-May-19 05:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
i won't dignify their chain with my time

[30-May-19 05:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a massive waste of the time of the entire world

[30-May-19 05:27 AM] Tek#5253
im just sayin' it will work eventually

[30-May-19 05:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
let somebody else attack it

[30-May-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
increase block size as necessary, do not do 128mb blocks if you don't need 128mb blocks

[30-May-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
crazy fucking idea

[30-May-19 05:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i think it follows from "more drugs = good" math

[30-May-19 05:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
in any case, are we in altseason yet?

[30-May-19 05:29 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:30 AM] dukeleto#7326

[30-May-19 05:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
I want to know how to stack my sats with shitcoins

[30-May-19 05:31 AM] Tek#5253
well if storage eventually becomes a non issue. everyone  having everything is actually benifical to sustain the species

[30-May-19 05:31 AM] Tek#5253
in case the space ship running the side chain dies

[30-May-19 05:31 AM] Tek#5253
or something

[30-May-19 05:31 AM] dukeleto#7326

[30-May-19 05:31 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:32 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:32 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:32 AM] Tek#5253
reeeeeeee

[30-May-19 05:34 AM] Alexfrog#1338
all my microcaps have either gone to 0 or gone at least 10x.  nothing in between ðŸ˜„

[30-May-19 05:35 AM] Alexfrog#1338
just dont put a lot in them

[30-May-19 05:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
you would think that perhaps the landslide of ico and coin failures last year would encourage more caution but hey, no one really gives shit. same crap shoot. different year.

[30-May-19 05:38 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:38 AM] Tek#5253
but then I sold at 60 sats

[30-May-19 05:38 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:38 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:39 AM] Tek#5253
didnt expect that pump

[30-May-19 05:40 AM] Tek#5253
it all started with the binance TRX trading competition

[30-May-19 05:40 AM] Tek#5253
it went from 20 sats to 1800 sats in a week

[30-May-19 05:40 AM] Tek#5253
or so

[30-May-19 05:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
retrospect in crypto is just self mutilation. we've all fucked up our million dollar paydays.

[30-May-19 05:42 AM] Tek#5253
do you margin trade

[30-May-19 05:42 AM] actionslacks#4072

[30-May-19 05:43 AM] actionslacks#4072

[30-May-19 05:43 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:43 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:43 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 05:43 AM] Tek#5253
invester for long term

[30-May-19 05:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
but yeah, if you wanna talk about missed boats. i sunk them. a lot of them. at some point it's just dumb luck. and i spend way to much time on it even still.

[30-May-19 05:49 AM] Tek#5253
i have to gather 25k KMD to spite computergenie

[30-May-19 05:51 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Anything to get attention I see

[30-May-19 05:52 AM] Tek#5253
no , just to spite him

[30-May-19 05:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol

[30-May-19 05:52 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Secretly you love him

[30-May-19 05:52 AM] Bittersweet#9376
And just want him to notice you

[30-May-19 05:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if he convinces you to buy 25k to spite him he wins, because he got you to buy KMD.

[30-May-19 05:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if you sell and KMD goes up he also wins ðŸ˜„

[30-May-19 05:53 AM] Tek#5253
;d

[30-May-19 05:54 AM] Bittersweet#9376

[30-May-19 05:59 AM] jspook16#3059
The prophecy looks good

[30-May-19 05:59 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
I would say the dominance will be even lower

[30-May-19 05:59 AM] Tek#5253
i hope so. btc sux

[30-May-19 05:59 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
There are more room for shitcoins to grow

[30-May-19 06:00 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
My guess is about 35%

[30-May-19 06:00 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
And far fat into the future I would say 15%

[30-May-19 06:00 AM] jspook16#3059
Kmd 10%?

[30-May-19 06:00 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
The market currently says pumping all shitcoins regardless

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Btc doesn't sux

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Btc is just for last resort

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] Bittersweet#9376
It's necessary too

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] Tek#5253
it sucks once you try using it

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
It is

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Every blockchain will suck once it has that much btc transaction

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] Tek#5253
doubt

[30-May-19 06:01 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Assuming it's not centralized database coin

[30-May-19 06:02 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Decentralized coins has a physical limit

[30-May-19 06:02 AM] Tek#5253
decentralized is a meme word. the internet infrasstructure isn't decentralized. how will you build a decentralized something on a centralized network infra?

[30-May-19 06:03 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Internet isn't infrastructure though

[30-May-19 06:03 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
It must have certain decentralization so that it is immune to government enforcement

[30-May-19 06:03 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
That ratio is up to the market though

[30-May-19 06:03 AM] Tek#5253
@Bittersweet theres a few huge big lines that run from country to country. and big hubs

[30-May-19 06:04 AM] Tek#5253
datacenters also have good connections to those

[30-May-19 06:04 AM] Tek#5253
its all centralized infra

[30-May-19 06:04 AM] Bittersweet#9376
All it takes is 1 sat

[30-May-19 06:04 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Like for example government can close binance exchange
