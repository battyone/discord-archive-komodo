KMD is the store of value chain of the ecosystem

[18-Jan-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
gains the 5%

[18-Jan-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
secures the value of all the other chains

[18-Jan-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
enables the automated crosschain

[18-Jan-19 11:16 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
there is many factors in play tech, marketing, dirty tricks, wash trades - may be hard to compete if some use kind of "tricks" to build cap

[18-Jan-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
really, even if it is limited to that it seems a lot more than most all other coins

[18-Jan-19 11:16 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That simple edu label would be huge haha

[18-Jan-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and the true value of KMD is related to the overall ecosystem

[18-Jan-19 11:16 AM] dokrates#8987
agree @jl777c about the statement of usage in kmd wallet due to encryption. I don't use it too much because that problem. Once agama becames encrypted i will use it more, and also could share with my coworkers, i work in a DC

[18-Jan-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so as the overall ecosystem grows, KMD is also gaining value

(tech * marketing) + E * ecosystemsize

[18-Jan-19 11:17 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so KMD is a core-service chain - other chains can live without it, just would loose some  "options" without KMD?

[18-Jan-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
hard to notarize to KMD without KMD...

[18-Jan-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but not impossible

[18-Jan-19 11:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
more smart people slowly coming to KMD, like these 51% hackers who were converted into believers? they are sill on board? 😃

[18-Jan-19 11:19 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
one was interested in cC

[18-Jan-19 11:19 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Is there a name for the new z kmd ?

[18-Jan-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
internal name is KMDCC

[18-Jan-19 11:19 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
hmm

[18-Jan-19 11:19 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sooner or later KMD will earn Antonopoulos  kind of guy who will promote KMD

[18-Jan-19 11:20 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think publicly it needs a better ticker

[18-Jan-19 11:20 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
having such guy is sometimes more then marketing and branding

[18-Jan-19 11:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c so this statement will be correct that with KMDCC the tx scaling is now doubled the amount it was with just KMD being single chain?

[18-Jan-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
denominated in KMD, yes. however think about gateways CC

[18-Jan-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
imagine 1000 chains, all with a KMD gateways CC

[18-Jan-19 11:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like if it was 200 tx/s now, it can be considered now 400 tx/s ?

[18-Jan-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
when KMDCC is there yes, and another 200tx/sec for each chain with a KMD gateway

[18-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
ecosystem tx/sec is about 10000 per sec now

[18-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
that is notarized tx/sec

[18-Jan-19 11:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's correct.... clearer... 🙂 👍

[18-Jan-19 11:25 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it sounds like good strategic decision - ecosystem now has 100% private chain, so KMD chain can focus on other things

[18-Jan-19 11:25 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I guess it also means Arrr wil gain some importance in KMD

[18-Jan-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it was just a consistent misperception

[18-Jan-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it does seem ARRR gains disproportionately from this, yes

[18-Jan-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
like people have noticed, each week, we are making advances that are significant and it is pretty much unscripted natural progress that is happening

[18-Jan-19 11:27 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I think Arrr can be a privacy utility for KMD, so probably Jumbler will get redesign to auto exchange KMD to Arrr or so?

[18-Jan-19 11:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so this update is:
- correcting the Myth: KMD is just a Privacy coin. It's not anymore.
- {Eating it's own cooked food} using crypto-conditions, MoMoM, Gateway CC, Assetchain for 1:1 of KMD chain
- Increases it's capacity of tx/s to double for KMD with KMD + KMDCC, means tx scaling!
- Gives compliance officers no excuse of turning away from KMD, since it's blockchain is not privacy anymore

[18-Jan-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
JUMBLR still retains the vast majority of its value which is the DEX revshare, but yes some privacy oriented service can be added to JUMBLR

[18-Jan-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically I am not having much time to work on JUMBLR enhancements...

[18-Jan-19 11:29 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@grewalsatinder  it sounds more like KMD stops to be Privacy coin at all - because the privacy was not used much, but same time it was covering the other cool tech that is original to KMD, if I see it correctly, also part of rebranding affecting tech

[18-Jan-19 11:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Privacy is just an added bonus to kmd tbh

[18-Jan-19 11:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Privacy was not used since the main reasons was 5.1% APR, that's my understanding

[18-Jan-19 11:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if you want you can use zaddr, but as not much of the supply is shielded, it's not really private

[18-Jan-19 11:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
only 0.01% ? were private funds... 🤔

[18-Jan-19 11:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sounds like good strategic business decision

[18-Jan-19 11:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
to be clearer in additon to my previous comment:
- KMD
   - Exactly like BTC now, means Only Transparent Transactions possible.
   - Only KMD chain supports 5.1% APR
- KMDCC
    - Will supports both Transparent and Private Transactions!
    - Will support Crypto-Conditions dApps on it too!! This is the HUGE one for me!!!

[18-Jan-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
this change happens Feb 15th

[18-Jan-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
KMDCC likely will still be in testing at that date

[18-Jan-19 11:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh yes.... correct 👍

[18-Jan-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so the 88,000 KMD in zaddr, needs to be moved out before Feb 15th

[18-Jan-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, you will need to submit a claim to me with the privkey

[18-Jan-19 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
actually, 50% already moved

[18-Jan-19 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
from over 150,000

[18-Jan-19 12:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so "if someone needs privacy" (while we now everyone needs it actually) best move to Arrr :pirate:

[18-Jan-19 12:29 PM] dokrates#8987
yes

[18-Jan-19 12:29 PM] dokrates#8987
very good move

[18-Jan-19 12:29 PM] dokrates#8987
i really like how kmd devs are working on it

[18-Jan-19 12:30 PM] dokrates#8987
very nice project, very happy with it

[18-Jan-19 12:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this also means z-tx coins will be able to trade on DEX (z-tx+ CC interlinked chain?) ?

[18-Jan-19 12:34 PM] SHossain#0007
not until zspv tech is there

[18-Jan-19 12:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Zcash solved zspv already? or still in progress?

[18-Jan-19 12:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain I doubt zSPV will make it possible to do CC on z-tx only chain mate 🤔

[18-Jan-19 12:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
z-tx only chain can not do CC

[18-Jan-19 12:37 PM] SHossain#0007
oh... CC support is not there

[18-Jan-19 12:37 PM] SHossain#0007
for pure private chains

[18-Jan-19 12:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes

[18-Jan-19 12:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but the inter chain is supposed to have both z-tx and CC - in the article

[18-Jan-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, they can do zaddr and they can do CC

[18-Jan-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but a chain that is zaddr only cant do CC

[18-Jan-19 12:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok I see the interchain will not be pure z-tx, so will be able to make z-tx -> t-tx -> use CC

[18-Jan-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[18-Jan-19 01:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to make CC work the blockchain MUST have the transparent transactions, just to make it clearer.

[18-Jan-19 01:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMDCC will have both Transparent and Private transactions.

[18-Jan-19 01:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So hypothetically we could switch from kmd to kmdcc to trigger a capital gain/loss

[18-Jan-19 01:09 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Without moving to fiat

[18-Jan-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure there is any accounting event switching between fungible chains. i havent seen anything regarding this

[18-Jan-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_soooooo doesn't want to be the test case when some idiot gets it in their head that it's a taxable "like-kind" exchange 🤦🏽_

[18-Jan-19 01:32 PM] bishop#9773
I think if the new side chain is traded on any exchanges, the argument for a taxable event moving from KMD to KMDCC, at least in the USA, goes up substantially given the current environment.

[18-Jan-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD will be the only one on exchanges

[18-Jan-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to have a single chain that is the chain that interfaces to exchanges, etc.

[18-Jan-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
keep the external interface coin as stable as possible

[18-Jan-19 01:33 PM] bishop#9773
then I don't think anyone has to worry about it personally (not tax advice). You need to have a market price to be able to have capital gains/losses

[18-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Strob#3417
Side question here just out of curiosity: why is KMD on so few exchanges (just 8 on cmc) for such a huge market cap?

[18-Jan-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Strob because exchanges generally ask for large sums of BTC to list and there tends to be a shortage of folks to volunteer 10s of thousands of USD value

[18-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Strob#3417
Ok. So the people behind KMD prefer not to spend money on listing...

[18-Jan-19 02:56 PM] dokrates#8987
yes

[18-Jan-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
listing costs are $100,000+ for cryptopia level exchanges

[18-Jan-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe millions for top tier exchanges

[18-Jan-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
we simply dont have such silly money available, our entire ICO was for $2 mil or so and most of the BTC is reserved for notarizations for the next decade

[18-Jan-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe cryptopia has lower listing fees now

{Reactions}
😆 (3) 🐗 trollface (4) 

[18-Jan-19 02:59 PM] Strob#3417
Yes that's really expensive. Ok the ico was really small, 2 M can be spent really fast i such a business

[18-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Strob#3417
But if Binance disapear tomorrow it would be  ahuge blow to KMD. I hope it could get listed on decentralized exchanges such a crypto-bridge or waves
