the team thinks that it is not part of komodo, but I think it is the best of komodo

[07-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Markus#5464
why do u think so

[07-Aug-19 01:26 PM] costa2439#3771
because it is a sustainable way to obtain profits, in a lawful way, thanks to the technology that komodo develops

[07-Aug-19 01:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio you are the only thing that is sketchy about kmd

[07-Aug-19 01:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[07-Aug-19 01:41 PM] Caglio#3337
whata moron I was

[07-Aug-19 01:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Sir I read 730 in my binance

[07-Aug-19 01:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Sry maybe we have diffrent settings

[07-Aug-19 01:42 PM] Markus#5464
u know how sat numbers work?

[07-Aug-19 01:42 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No

[07-Aug-19 01:42 PM] Markus#5464
1 Satoshi    = 0.00000001 à¸¿
100,000 Satoshi    = 0.00100000 à¸¿
1,000,000 Satoshi    = 0.01000000 à¸¿
10,000,000 Satoshi    = 0.10000000 à¸¿
100,000,000 Satoshi    = 1.00000000 à¸¿

[07-Aug-19 01:42 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ok you are correct

[07-Aug-19 01:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Some people just have diffrent settings no need to be anal about it

[07-Aug-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464
its not about settings

[07-Aug-19 01:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I say what I read

[07-Aug-19 01:45 PM] Markus#5464
nice

[07-Aug-19 01:45 PM] Markus#5464
btc pumped with no volume

[07-Aug-19 01:45 PM] Markus#5464
ðŸ¤”

[07-Aug-19 01:51 PM] Oszy#5734
well there was a 1k btc sell wall at 12k destroyed in 2 minutes on binance.

[07-Aug-19 01:52 PM] Oszy#5734
that 1k as market sell could have crash it down a few hundred bucks

[07-Aug-19 01:52 PM] Oszy#5734
ðŸ˜„

[07-Aug-19 01:52 PM] Markus#5464
imagine if u have 100 million in bitcoin and put it all on a limit order at kmd 30k sats, there would not be enough sellers to even fill it and price would never dump

[07-Aug-19 01:53 PM] altcoinist#1501
If I had 100 million l'd create my own shitcoin and pump it

[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
u could so easily make a killing on kmd with 100 mil

[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
u simply place the 100m at 30k, ppl will try to dump into it,  1 day later ppl start trading above it

[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
and u sell bit by bit in small profit

[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah totally

[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] Caglio#3337
But you could do that on any other coin also

[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] Markus#5464
not rly

[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] Caglio#3337
why not, u just need another coin noone knows shit about

[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] Caglio#3337
or care

[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] Caglio#3337
pac coin

[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
and ofc u need 100 milions

[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
why it would work with kmd is cause market cap is around 100 mil

[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
and probably 50% or more would not sell

[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Well any coin that has lower market cap rofl

[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
so u can easily manipulate it

[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
And kmd is what

[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
rank 70 80 ?

[07-Aug-19 01:57 PM] Caglio#3337
I havent even notic its under 90cents now

[07-Aug-19 01:57 PM] Markus#5464
thats perfect....ppl would see 200% gains and jump on it and help u push price even higher, meanwhile u sell bit by bit and probably make 10% profit in a week

[07-Aug-19 01:57 PM] Caglio#3337
stable ( :

[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
stability incorporated

[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Kmd rekt

[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
no time to panic tho

[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
completely normal and understandable

[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
we will panic at 1k sats

[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] Caglio#3337
or even better on 800 sats

[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] Caglio#3337
buy bags more on 1000 sats

[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] Caglio#3337
kmd bags = best bags

[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] JimD#9272
70

[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Im buying at 4k

[07-Aug-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
let it drop

[07-Aug-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
its fine

[07-Aug-19 02:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Its amazing yes

[07-Aug-19 02:00 PM] Caglio#3337
10k are now worth under 1k

[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] Caglio#3337
the best investment since I went to gamble dead drunk

[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] Caglio#3337
But good moment to buy now

[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] Caglio#3337
We are "bottoming"

[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] altcoinist#1501

[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] Markus#5464

[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] Markus#5464
