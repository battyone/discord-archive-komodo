_got better insults on AOL in '86_

[29-May-19 08:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
the manhood insults are kind of a chick thing imo,  not taking sides. or assuming genders. i'd ask him about his wife's bf or something.

[29-May-19 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735

Trade talk isn't the same without one person talking like their big shit while actually trading with small amounts.

[29-May-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253

when does one have a large enough stack ?

[29-May-19 08:53 PM] JimD#9272
100K?

[29-May-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
well no

[29-May-19 08:54 PM] JimD#9272
You must either be trading a down payment on a house, or a house

[29-May-19 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when does one have a large enough stack ?`
I'll let you know when I get there, but between now and then it's infinity

[29-May-19 08:54 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Whales do not trade with their entire stack either but even then their small is like 10k, not 1k or less.

[29-May-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
I made a good trade. bought kmd at 14k and 15k and sold at 16k and 17k

[29-May-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-May-19 08:56 PM] crumb#2550
do you realise how much you spend on trading fees?

[29-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
if I can make 1% each trade I make profit

[29-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
yes I do

[29-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
trading fees are low

[29-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
on binance

[29-May-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you passed on 16% to make 1% 🤷🏽

[29-May-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253
you aren't really getting anything I say are you

[29-May-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253
i meant I only need to have 1% increase to cover trading costs

[29-May-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253
and I just made atleast 10%

[29-May-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253
so i did good

[29-May-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
even 1% is worth it

[29-May-19 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i meant I only need to have 1% increase to cover trading costs`
and you could have make 16% over costs

[29-May-19 08:59 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Day trading is something you do for fun. The real money is in swing trading with weeks and months.

[29-May-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's like walking into the kitchen, washing 1 dish, walking out, and then expecting your wife to be proud of you

[29-May-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253

I'm  not saying that you're a liar,  just that you're a fraud (calling people "pleb" and your broke ass hasn't averaged out of 20k buys  yet)

[29-May-19 09:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Last warning , goto #talk-other-topics  this isn’t the channel for this,  this is to both of you

[29-May-19 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`then he comes and attack me`
don't use words if you don't expect people to hold you to  them
and, yes, @polycryptoblog this is the channel because it's about his trading comments specifically

[29-May-19 09:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The conversation has devolved into vitriol .

[29-May-19 09:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_closes his laptop because he needs to reboot shit after power failure due to storm, don't let that go to your head_

[29-May-19 09:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I won’t ,  I don’t like stepping in to shit like this,  but when several people message me because of the little flame war that’s going on,  thats just a bad look on our community.

[29-May-19 09:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So.. uh

[29-May-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 09:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but when several people message me`
...tell them to grow up and/or head to #safespace

[29-May-19 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

It reads “CSW transferred 50k BTC from the biggest BTC wallet to Binance, which confirmed he is the real Satoshi. As such CZ will re-list BSV and make an official apology on Twitter” 

it’s fake af but many retail will believe it for a while before they figure out it...
