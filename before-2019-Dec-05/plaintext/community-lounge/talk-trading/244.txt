[23-Oct-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If SHA256 is comprimised in some way all of crypto is dead... very scary situation

[23-Oct-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181

`everyone trying out lighting having a bad experience?`
"good" and "bad" are relative terms
Anyone that accepts that LN is **not** part of bitcoin will likely have a "good" experience
Anyone that thinks that LN **is** part of bitcoin will likely become disillusioned once they realize that most uses for it are non-personal

If I had the kind of bank that let me use $2M just to manipulate 1 market, I'm fairly certain I'd spend less time staring at 3 monitors for 18 hrs a day üòõ

`"Why not improve BCH"? That doesn't make any sense.`
Sure it does, BCH is rekt because core didn't write it

[23-Oct-18 11:44 AM] snowdamn#2414

in case the point was missed: it doesn't matter which camp you are in, i am just pointing out that it's ridiculous to make statements like "bch devs are smarter" which can't be really proven anyway, may the better coin win, it doesn't matter for trading, you just go with the market. in general competition is good, but companies/institutions/teams that are obsessed on destroying their competition rather than improving their own stuff are usually wiped out of markets.

for the whale it would also make sense to stop accumulating, wait a week, let price go down again, restart at 15-18k sats

I think he stays below the 21k range for a reason

[23-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If we break above then we would breakout pattern upward

[23-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And bots would pile in?

[23-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Vertigo#0439
I don't know how easy would be to dump 6 million kmds

[23-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
depends on the ceiling, if you move the market up high enough, 6M might only drop it back down to 20k
rinse... repeat
