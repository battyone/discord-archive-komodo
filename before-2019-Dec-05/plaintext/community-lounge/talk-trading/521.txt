Got people asking me what to do again the past week

[07-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That didnt ask anything crypto related in almost 2 years

[07-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And where in december I was confidently saying buy buy buy

[07-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[07-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Well, not with a high enough confidence interval

[07-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Markus#5464
well we got 2 options...we test 50 ma on weekly chart which is around 5600 or we dump hard, possibly retest 4600 if it wont hold then 4200

[07-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I‚Äôm waiting for a entry in btc

[07-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Markus#5464
but to me dump make more sense, RSI is  on 87 on daily and stochastic is also at its peak

[07-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Either we go up or we go down there for sure

[07-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Markus#5464
and volume is drying up

[07-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Dumppp ittttt

[07-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
but we didnt break 21 monthly ema (638 daily ema)

[07-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
so idk

[07-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah but still an easily manipulated market

[07-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How do longs/shorts look?

[07-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Markus#5464

I thought it was guaranteed BTC to $1500?

[07-Apr-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
what happened to that. i want some at that price

[07-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you believe twatter we‚Äôll see anything between 1500 and 5600 as a next stop üôà

[07-Apr-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
I want to buy at that $1500 price and then sell it for the $50,000 it is guaranteed to get to

[07-Apr-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
seems like easy money

[07-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Goes to show nobody actually knows what will happen, and I think that if there are people that can predict it with 99% certainty wouldnt be sharing it with others

[07-Apr-19 05:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just catching up on the chat. Please note that the whitepaper out there is old and the PoP protocol has evolved since then. VeriBlock uses a form of block reference braiding mixed with finality delay parameters that make any privately-mined chain have to perform PoP publications which give full visibility of the chain (where the attack starts, proof the attack is being produced at a sufficient difficulty, whether the attack is still possible).

[07-Apr-19 05:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I still don't understand this braiding thing. It seems to me anyone who wants to spend a ton of money can become the true braider regardless. Yea he's making PoP publications but what's to stop him from making the most? What would invalidate him as an publisher?

[07-Apr-19 05:56 PM] crunchycat#0726
Hey guys, glad you finally made it over to discuss the tech with the actual devs

[07-Apr-19 05:57 PM] crunchycat#0726
also fyi they just made me a mod, wasn't one before.  Just wanted to keep full transparency

[07-Apr-19 06:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are you going to ban me @crunchycat

[07-Apr-19 06:06 PM] crunchycat#0726
lol, no

[07-Apr-19 06:06 PM] crunchycat#0726
I actually enjoy your sense of humor

[07-Apr-19 06:06 PM] crunchycat#0726
just keep it clean in there

[07-Apr-19 06:07 PM] crunchycat#0726
also rn we're trying to let Max and Hjalmar have a tech discussion, so we may delete rougue posts and dm you why we did it

[07-Apr-19 06:07 PM] crunchycat#0726
just to keep the technical discussion clean and between the devs

[07-Apr-19 06:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There is public code?

[07-Apr-19 06:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Can you link it?

[07-Apr-19 06:16 PM] crunchycat#0726

Would be good if you guys could funnel your Q's to Hjalmar, or if once he's finished just one of you could aggregate Q's and hop in.  If you let me know who'll be taking that role we could shift the discussion between Max and your guy

[07-Apr-19 06:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_Has but one question_
"There is public code?"

[07-Apr-19 06:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is Ambroid still around in your Veriblock 's Discord  ?

[07-Apr-19 06:20 PM] crunchycat#0726
He's there from time to time

[07-Apr-19 06:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
he wrote a medium article, and when people question his points, he doesn't even bother to response ...

[07-Apr-19 06:23 PM] crunchycat#0726
dunno, I mean he's just a community member so I can't speak for his medium article

[07-Apr-19 06:26 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah sorry, I know it's not your fault, I'm just a bit frustrated when people are not responsible for what they wrote 
```In Komodo, which is a system very similar to Delegated Proof of Stake, the Notary nodes automatically put their OP_RETURN proofs into the Bitcoin blockchain just by the virtue of existing. These nodes get their rewards by securing the DPoS system```
And yet he claimed he understand how dPoW works ...

[07-Apr-19 06:29 PM] crunchycat#0726
he's pretty active on Twitter isn't he?  Could try correcting there or dming him on Discord?

[07-Apr-19 06:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I don't think it will work https://twitter.com/anambroid/status/1113571784765390858

@Jacobstoon @CarpeNoctom @KomodoPlatform I understand how it works and I'm not reading their whitepaper again. 
It's centralized, users have no say in it. It's an inferior solution by a team with shady history that exit pumped their previous shitcoin.

[07-Apr-19 06:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
did mention him once in Discord, he just ignored

[07-Apr-19 06:35 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that's what I call *willful ignorance*

[07-Apr-19 06:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[07-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only retardation in response

[07-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Best not waste more time

[07-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My only question is how PoP *PREVENTS* a 51% attack and not just warn you when an attack is imminent/happening.

[07-Apr-19 06:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How is it any different from what ZEN does as @Alright said

[07-Apr-19 06:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Besides being vastly more expensive that is

[07-Apr-19 06:39 PM] crunchycat#0726
Do you guys want to funnel Qs to @Alright ?

[07-Apr-19 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[07-Apr-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No those were remarks he posed and i am reiterating them for you @crunchycat

[07-Apr-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As that is what you asked

[07-Apr-19 06:55 PM] crunchycat#0726
If anybody is talking with jl777c could you ask him to join VBK discord for the technical discussion that's happening currently?  Would be good to get some of the many questions you guys have answered while Max is on.

[07-Apr-19 06:55 PM] crunchycat#0726
I didn't tag him since I already dm'd him

[07-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Alright#0419
Could someone let me know when shiggidy tweets about me eating babies?

[07-Apr-19 07:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
haha got it

[07-Apr-19 07:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
he's probably digging up articles where alright and the holocaust are used in the same sentence as we speak

VeriBlock and its PooP Protocol

it describes how to attack PoP, but of course maybe the close source has some centralized mechanism that allows to choose the winning chain

[07-Apr-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
I will consider technical discussions after it is open source and the misinformation about dPoW is retracted

[07-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362

they already had a discussion in there. I really don't understand shit but well..

[07-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
in Discord.

[07-Apr-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a fundamental attack against a decentralized oracle, which is basically what PoP is trying to do. the problem is how to know which PoP are "real" and which are the "attackers". You cant discuss away such vulnerabilities

[07-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
Max (from VBK), the author of the article and @Alright  that joined later on
