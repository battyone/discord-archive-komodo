by saying he can keep double-spending within the 7.5 minutes between EMC2 and BTC blocks he means keep swapping and withdrawing? ü§î

[13-Oct-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if the exchange requires more than 3 EMC2 confirms then his deposit wont be accepted

[13-Oct-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is double spent

[13-Oct-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is notarized, then he cant do the deposit

[13-Oct-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so either way the key is that the exchange requires more deposits than the notarization lag

[13-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm shilling geocold on coming here to claim his 1000 pirate I offered him

[13-Oct-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
or best case to use the notarization lag as the required confirmations

[13-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

i wish he could have gotten to the dpow part

[13-Oct-18 10:08 PM] bishop#9773
Didn't he give up because the hashrate spiked and it would have cost him more than he had?

[13-Oct-18 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I need a few more A9s; maybe I should do a vid and get "donations" to 51% WLC :trollface:

[13-Oct-18 11:02 PM] jspook16#3059
@Instel7 shapeshift

[13-Oct-18 11:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
shapeshift is better

[13-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Never tried it

[13-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Only going by what I have experience with

[13-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nothing against shapeshift

[13-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Instel7#1416
I want to change about 50-60 KMD for bitcoin, wanting to avoid high fees since it's a low ammount

[13-Oct-18 11:03 PM] jspook16#3059
Changelly works too but I think they just use shapeshift

[13-Oct-18 11:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[13-Oct-18 11:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like that guy is trying to 51% bitcoin private lol

Bullshit that you got banned @Geocold51

[14-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Geocold51#6462
Huh?

[14-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You agree with your ban from twitch and stream?

[14-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
Yes I got banned

[14-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
It's possible I did not get banned from Stream.me and rather that their infestructure is broken but I doubt it. When I try to stream it establishes a connection and then the connection is dropped.
