[22-Oct-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well I did thusands of bets at 1:1 and always lost all of my coins... unless I broke the dealer node, and made the bets timeout

[22-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still its very fun

[22-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all gambling is house wins.... so this is no diiffrent

[22-Oct-18 01:32 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I got 1000 coins total.   1 bet 10, roll 50% chance. I lose, I bet 20, 50 chance to win, I lose, I bet 40 50% chance to win. I win, I get 40+40 =80. on total I spent 10+20+40 and won 80 = 10 profit <- can't this be done endlessly?

[22-Oct-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no because there is no 50/50 odds

[22-Oct-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think @TonyL  scripted this ? I never tested it myself... I was trying to see mostly how many dice bets it could take at once than anything else, by the time I got to it, but never finished my work there.

[22-Oct-18 01:36 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
uhm I kinda got caught up in the dice analogy, so it's not just a coinflip.

[22-Oct-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no.. the mim odds is 1:1 but you get 3 coins back for 1 bet.

[22-Oct-18 01:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its a probability game more than nothing

[22-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
decentralised RNG pretty cool concept

[22-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Jetter73#2234
So 1:1 is actually 33%?

[22-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Jetter73#2234
1:2 payout

[22-Oct-18 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes if you bet 1 and win, you get 2 plus the bet back

[22-Oct-18 01:40 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
what about gambling laws? I assue I could trade to KMD right? would that alert governments and tax offices?

[22-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant see how they could apply

[22-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
who do they charge

[22-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the code?

[22-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Jetter73#2234
Is the code the house?

[22-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the house cannot wiithdraw

[22-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
effectivly all winnings by the house are burnt

[22-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Jetter73#2234
Where does its bank roll come from?

[22-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
premine

[22-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
went into the contract on this particular chain

[22-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you can launch dice contracts on any AC  with diffrent parameters

[22-Oct-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we had a cluster of 4(?) chains where you could transfer coins between them and also dice bet on 5 tables on each chain at the same time.

[22-Oct-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
worked motsly... but was a bit buggy for production use.

[22-Oct-18 01:43 AM] Jetter73#2234
I wonder how this would work for a chain that does not burn the house winnings

[22-Oct-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the contract cannot withdraw

[22-Oct-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need dice2  for that

[22-Oct-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
limitaion in the code... only way to wthdraw is grind enropy TX and try to win your own bet out as the dealer...

[22-Oct-18 02:18 AM] bishop#9773
@bpkdasbaum `can't this be done endlessly?` No because the max bet is 1000. If you are on a bad roll, you cap out

350-116= 234 btc   ~ Whale bought 234 btc kmd? (1,168,100 kmd)

[22-Oct-18 02:28 PM] BlockTech#6895
Something like that yes, more around 1,5M KMD i think, his price range was between 17k and 21k sat, but most of the time around 18k

@stonemountain in #deleted-channel

[22-Oct-18 03:02 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
the only question is, for how long will this go on, until the bottom is cleared? 22k is resistance, after that maybe 33k, but seems to be pretty much clear skies. anyone keeon selling/shorting the bottom, do it now, it's your chance 😄

I think @Acura once tried to sell some assets, but dont remember 100% if it was DEX or JUMBLR 😦

[22-Oct-18 05:27 PM] hastrup#8742
Cool thx I will pm him

[22-Oct-18 06:13 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Guys. What do you need 2mio KMD for? Is there a real use case? Masternodes? I can't imagine it being just for staking, and if selling at top. dunno sounds ludicrous but maybe by fishbrain can't comprehend the grandness of the whale.

[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Could be a couple things,  a hedge fund and an exchange seem to be the likely culprits

[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
But just speculation

[22-Oct-18 06:17 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
