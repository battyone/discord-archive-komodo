@polycryptoblog  one solution could be to encourage people by increase of % revenue for people having full nodes, otherwise does not make any sense...  or even more controversial - make the 5.1% rev only for full nodes

[25-Sep-18 06:28 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually it make sense to give reward to people who add value

[25-Sep-18 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you need to be incentivized to not have the entire network security of your currency boil down to a centralized group of servers (that may or may not be controlled by the same small group of people -- cough*banks*cough), then perhaps P2P cryptocurrency isn't the thing for you

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  for me same way as you cannot expect everyone to be same time a dev, policeman,  fireman,doctor, eng teacher - you cannot expect all people to do some thing you like. I mean you can - but it's not realistic.

Caring about  fire security is being fireman in this example - everyone should be a fireman ?

BTC price drop will wake you up!!! 😜

Nah, unless I feel the rushes of *at least* 10% drops/rises within the hour, I am dead inside

Wait, does low volume make an exchange a shitbox?  ::cough cough:: barterdex

not changing from 4 BTC decimals for a year

[25-Sep-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@meatspoon yes, low volume makes an exchange bad and giving 100% control and ownership of your currency to another party makes an exchange good

[25-Sep-18 04:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
Thanks for the tip, Haiduc.  I learn so much from you, probably due to how incredibly smart you are compared to... well, everyone.

[25-Sep-18 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, ask a dumbass question and you're likely to get a smartass answer 🤦

[25-Sep-18 04:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah man, i just cant thank you enough for your patience.  Even though you get annoyed and call everyone that disagrees with you stupid, i mean, who can argue with that?  Thanks for being so benevolent with us inferior creatures.

[25-Sep-18 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`call everyone that disagrees with you stupid`
Hyperbole much?

[25-Sep-18 04:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
not really.  I have watched you call people who value BTC stupid.  I have watched you call people who value ETH stupid.  You have even implied Vitalik is stupid.  Anytime someone disagrees with you, you rightfully and righteously call them stupid.  Because they are.

[25-Sep-18 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I have watched you call people who value ETH stupid.`
Actually, you didn't ever watch that, you extrapolated that from your imagination

[25-Sep-18 04:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
nope.  you have  called ETH a shitcoin and ETH supporters stupid

[25-Sep-18 04:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am not criticizing you!  I am marveling at how well you navigate this world full of absolute morons without losing your mind.  It must be hard being so much smarter than everyone and right about everything while everyone else is wrong.

[25-Sep-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You have the same prolem as every other person on the far-left, you can't seem to separate the distinction from pointing out stupid thoughts/actions/comments from calling a person stupid

[25-Sep-18 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
far left?  once again, you drag politics into a conversation not about politics.  Deflection?

[25-Sep-18 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you have called ETH a shitcoin and ETH supporters stupid` I defy you to show evidence of either of those claims

[25-Sep-18 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My issue with ETH is one of immutability and I've never said otherwise

[25-Sep-18 05:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
This thread is a cornucopia of venomous comments from you regarding other peoples stupid, incorrect views

[25-Sep-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"peoples stupid, incorrect views" is not the same as "stupid people" 😉

[25-Sep-18 05:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
But like i said, it is also a testament to your patience and benevolence.  Most geniuses wouldn't even bother to correct the wretchedly stupid masses.  You cast pearls at our filthy feet.

[25-Sep-18 05:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
Even though most often we don't know what to do with them due to our ignorance

[25-Sep-18 05:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I love that you get offended by someone disagreeing with you, it shows your strong, self-assured nature 👍

[25-Sep-18 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am offended?

[25-Sep-18 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am grateful

[25-Sep-18 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
Every exchange with you is rubbing elbows with an intellectual power house

[25-Sep-18 05:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
and you are so generous with your time

[25-Sep-18 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The irony that you're so offended by sarcasm and yet so ready to type it out (ad nauseam) makes me giggle

[25-Sep-18 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am glad you are giggling.  I know I am incapable of competing with your tumescent intellect.  The most I can hope to be in the presence of your greatness is a jester-like figure, which might occasionally amuse you with some perfectly timed flatulence.

@meatspoon There comes a point where I'm just a dick, but that's a different point from you chiming in and asking for me to stomp all over your pea-brain 😉

[25-Sep-18 07:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
Once again, with your infinite perception, you spot things I don't...  and you share with me examples of my ignorance so that I may strive to be less stupid.  Many thanks, Robinhood
