4/ So, what's the punishment for issuing an unregistered security?

$250k. End of story. Yes, really.

AirFox & Paragon raised $15 million and $12 million respectively. Both are free & clear with a $250k penalty + compliance (registration & disclosures).

This isnt too bad tbh

[18-Nov-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the having to refund everybody part seems the biggest issue

[18-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
indeed, but only when you fill out a claims form etc

[18-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Biggest question is whether the refund would be in crypto or in fiat...

[18-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's say they raised most of the funds during the ATH times, and now they still hold the same amount of ETH or whatever

[18-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But as ETH has lost 80% of its value compared to ATH, basically a lot of these ICO's would be royally screwed...

[18-Nov-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is the point of this attack

[18-Nov-18 12:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
The SEC waited until there was the least likelihood of a legal challenge.

[18-Nov-18 12:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
Now they get to make the rules since no one has the money to fight them anymore.

[18-Nov-18 12:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
But on the whole it‚Äôs a good sign. The SEC is a puppet agency that let‚Äôs Goldman and other Madoff types get away with murder whilst going after small fish who threaten big fish‚Äôs profits.

if it's true what J Nguyen says - easy to rent 10-15k petahash then all coins below BTC hashrate are in danger. Maybe even BTC could ba attacked and destroyed if somebody really wated to get more hash - if gettin 15k peta is easy, then getting 51% seems just a bit harder?

When all these people bought KMD ? So many sell every day..

[18-Nov-18 06:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A lot are created everyday

[18-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Lieutenant#1428
how much ?

[18-Nov-18 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
about 3BTC worth is created/mined per day.

[18-Nov-18 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
not exactly "a lot"

[18-Nov-18 06:26 PM] snowdamn#2414
is there a way to see how much APR is being claimed daily? not that it's being sold necessarily
should check dexstats before asking such questions but whatever üòÉ

@jl777c those 3 btc are mining with hardware & interest claim together?

[18-Nov-18 06:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
3*1440 is the mining
the rest of 24h coin supply change is claims

[18-Nov-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is assuming exactly what is accrued that day is claimed. the reality is likely a bit more clumpy

[18-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Markus#5464
Great arbitrage opportunity for the ppl to buy BCHSV on poloniex and sell on binance, like 30$ price diff xD

[18-Nov-18 07:02 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
just read "sec claims that the ico party is over" how do you think will this affect dicos and kmd respectively. Also how much of an impact has US? There is still the whole rest of the world and there always will be malta

[18-Nov-18 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
minimal impact as there havent been that many dico recently anyway

[18-Nov-18 08:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Mined chains seem to have more grip in kmd

[18-Nov-18 08:23 PM] snowdamn#2414

kmd is at discount price imo

[18-Nov-18 09:58 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@jl777c https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-anatomy-of-bitcoin-cores-recent-bug  this is about the bitcoin inflation bug (and above my technical understanding), but kmd is a fork of zcash and zcash is a fork of bitcoin. possible that the same vulnaribility is in kmd an needs to be adressed?

[18-Nov-18 10:13 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't affect zcash

[18-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
therefore doesn't affect KMD or assetchains

[18-Nov-18 10:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the vulnerability was detected in version 0.14 , which is after the introduction of Zcash I think.

[18-Nov-18 10:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so it likely doesn't affect Zcash

[18-Nov-18 10:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
btw if kmd price holds here and we get reversal. (and it looks right now, like it does at 16ksats) then we got hidden bullish divergence on rsi

Kraken enables BSV trading, but (1) says that coin is technically sub-par and dangerous, and (2) will socialize BSV losses stemming from nChain. 

This is beyond hilarious.

regarding the whole securities/ICO thing that the SEC is looking into

[19-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Can it be a security if you dont do an ICO and if you are only able to mine a coin?

[19-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if you buy tokens on an exchange it's not the coin itself that is making promises, no?
