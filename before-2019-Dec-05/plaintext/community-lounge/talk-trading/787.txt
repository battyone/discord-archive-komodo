yeah didn't expect this either

[20-Jun-19 07:10 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Ooh well

[20-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Markus#5464
its just a bot pressuring price down

[20-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Markus#5464
there was a 12k sell lowering price by 1 sat every few mins and nobody bought it

[20-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Markus#5464
made bots dump infront of it

[20-Jun-19 07:26 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Happy to find my 15k sat orders filled üòÉ I figured we‚Äôd see it dip again.  Hope to see the trend start going the way we are all hoping for though.  Launch is around the corner.  No delays right?

[20-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Launch will dump even harder

[20-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs the KMD way

Look on the bright side, it doesn‚Äôt cost shit to DPOW a chain

[20-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
frens

[20-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
wtf

[20-Jun-19 07:51 PM] dan.#2473
bai

[20-Jun-19 07:52 PM] crumb#2550
look at bigger picture. it's a sea of red all over

[20-Jun-19 07:52 PM] crumb#2550
it's all about BTC

[20-Jun-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC Dominance:  57.7%

[20-Jun-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
last time it peaked a bit over 60%...

[20-Jun-19 07:54 PM] crumb#2550
and volumes for this kmd drop are not big, at least on BittIRS they are not

[20-Jun-19 07:54 PM] crumb#2550
too lazy to check binance

[20-Jun-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
considering binance was closed for 10 days, you would expect more than 100btc of volumes, so it does seem on the low side

[20-Jun-19 07:58 PM] blubbi#0643
what launch?

[20-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Markus#5464
10k soon?

[20-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Sherdogz#6731
If btc goes parabolic who knows... At least BTC is doing well

[20-Jun-19 08:17 PM] BlackJesus#6161
BTC is going to exactly what it did last time.

[20-Jun-19 08:18 PM] BlackJesus#6161
fall back down when fees hit 10$+

[20-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Tek#5253
nah they convinced the public that BTC is "gold" and you are supposed to "hold" not use it

[20-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Tek#5253
not send it around

[20-Jun-19 08:18 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm not paying 10 dollars to move my money around >.> Hell I'm not paying 2.50 wtf am i buying movie tickets from ticketmaster with a convenience fee?

[20-Jun-19 08:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
have you ever moved hundreds of thousands of dollars around?

[20-Jun-19 08:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
it gets costly

[20-Jun-19 08:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
The public can't be that dumb. Over time the publics dissonance will wane and the truth will prevail it always does.

[20-Jun-19 08:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It shouldn't be especially when the money is digital

[20-Jun-19 08:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
something I never understood with money wires either

[20-Jun-19 08:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
you are right that it shouldnt be that expensive.  but it is.  thats why btc has a good shot

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it has to be a % at a certain amount?

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
even excluding money wires.  try selling or buying real estate

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
if the notes were physical of course I can see the price going up with quantity

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
but digital makes 0 sense.

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
insurance

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
liability

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
third party issues

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
makes perfect sense

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
when you need to trust intermediaries, you have to pay them because they need insurance

[20-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I can see the insurance and liability thing but honestly in the traditional system now it's moot

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
BTC is making it moot, yes

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
how many times have you read about people getting millions of dollars in their account by mistake

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the bank just reverses it.

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
not many

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They have that power, so it still makes almsot 0 sense.

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
to you, maybe

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If they were non reversible then ok ill give you that.

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
i agree that they have become exploitative

[20-Jun-19 08:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
and i agree that their fees are too high.... hence, btc

[20-Jun-19 08:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
if they had kept their fees low and reasonable, btc wouldnt have the chance that it does

[20-Jun-19 08:23 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Banks mess up all the time and can correct it at will hell even overcorrect and you're only course of action is to call them and wait for them to give you your stuff back.

[20-Jun-19 08:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
but banks set the table for btc and crypto in general with their greed and bloated  systems

[20-Jun-19 08:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
you keep making the case for BTC with $10 fees

[20-Jun-19 08:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Not really I'm all about using.

[20-Jun-19 08:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I use my crypto and actually buy stuff and replenish it regularly.

[20-Jun-19 08:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Using it is the only way it maintains value, it has to be in circulation.

[20-Jun-19 08:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
thats your choice.  more people are treating btc like gold

[20-Jun-19 08:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
i own gold.  i dont spend it or mess with it.  i stack it

[20-Jun-19 08:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
but there are people i see at the LCS that buy and sell and shuffle their stacks

[20-Jun-19 08:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
their choice.  i dont think its a good one

[20-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Gold will always be a good hold it has innate properties that makes it valuable in a functional way.

[20-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
diamonds on the other hand...

[20-Jun-19 08:26 PM] BlackJesus#6161
bitcoin on the other hand... especially when you take away its functional purpose which is to be moved at low cost

[20-Jun-19 08:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
btc has legs on it, in my opinion.  maybe not many years worth, but a few years

[20-Jun-19 08:26 PM] dan.#2473
network effect and security

[20-Jun-19 08:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
it has outperformed most alts too.  there is not much reason to believe that will change much in the near future

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC is the safe bet

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] BlackJesus#6161
On principal

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
wont be the best performing crypto, but certainly will be in the top half

üëÜ 

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I cannot support it for abandoning its maiden idea.

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if not top quarter

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
it doesnt need your support, mang

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] BlackJesus#6161
true that.

[20-Jun-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
financial performance wise, for many years

[20-Jun-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
though stable coins that dont go up in price could well end up with many times BTC marketcap

[20-Jun-19 08:28 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm  betting on BCH, because they are focusing on useage and market adoption.

[20-Jun-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
because they provide a unit that is inflating at the universally agreed rate of all fiats

[20-Jun-19 08:29 PM] BlackJesus#6161
So you're saying the pegged coins are just going to float the market.

[20-Jun-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the "unstable" crypto will be like options traders

[20-Jun-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
most will stick with index funds and maybe a few blue chip stocks

[20-Jun-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
too much expertise needed for crypto, with stable coins it will be look up their moody credit rating, sort by yield

[20-Jun-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed income market, very boring, but very big

[20-Jun-19 08:32 PM] dan.#2473
theres too much money in too many alts that dont do anything

[20-Jun-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it is much better than a few years ago

[20-Jun-19 08:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Eos feels like a ticking time bomb üôÅ

[20-Jun-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
at least there are coins that do something

[20-Jun-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
before it was just all BTC clones

[20-Jun-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and XRP

[20-Jun-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if spywarecoin is going to be on CMC, then there is room for EOS

[20-Jun-19 08:34 PM] BlackJesus#6161
CMC has no credibility

[20-Jun-19 08:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they took bitconnect's money and ran all their ads 24/7 during and before that entire debacle.

[20-Jun-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
fiduciary duty to their stockholders!

[20-Jun-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
have to protect the women and children

[20-Jun-19 08:36 PM] dan.#2473
thats how all this will end up

[20-Jun-19 08:36 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If I was sponsored by someone or took someone's money and willingly ran their ads and it turned out to be a ponzi scheme. Would I not be liable?

[20-Jun-19 08:36 PM] Tek#5253
maybe we can trade tonite bosi
