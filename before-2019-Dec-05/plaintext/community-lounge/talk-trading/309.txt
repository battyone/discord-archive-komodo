I got in crypto like 16 months ago

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Caglio#3337
There were less than 500 coins listed on coinmarketcap

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Caglio#3337
now there are over 2000

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Caglio#3337
sto 1500 in 16 months

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`500 coins in 2 minutes ?`
my bad, is was 7 minutes ago when you said 2000

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Caglio#3337
100 coins per month, little less

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Caglio#3337
so 3 coins per day ( :

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Sorry, 2071 coin, on coin market cap

[26-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Caglio#3337
I was not telling exact number, just a figure of speech

[26-Nov-18 08:59 PM] Caglio#3337
still 1571 coin in 16 months....

[26-Nov-18 08:59 PM] Caglio#3337
How many of them are used in anything except mindless transactions ?

[26-Nov-18 08:59 PM] Caglio#3337
100 ?

[26-Nov-18 09:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"figures of speech" are things that should be avoided when you're attempting to employ "pure logic" to a point that is invalid to begin with 😉
quit while you're behind

This feels like arguing in 1995 that the internet is only good for chat rooms and crappy porn image downloads.

[26-Nov-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
number of coins might not rival number of websites...

[26-Nov-18 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes this is true.    But we had our pets.com moment in Paragon didn't we?

[26-Nov-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe it will, because the cost to launch a coin does not take a nation state, or even a large company

[26-Nov-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
and since it is possible, no company will ever agree to use any other companys coin, so each company will make their own, that is pretty much a given

[26-Nov-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and there are a lot of companies

[26-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Caglio#3337
Great, and those companies are going to use those coins between their products

[26-Nov-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and these companies will come up with ways that make their coins attractive to use, ie. product discounts, so people will actually use these coins

[26-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
there are still more stocks than coins out there 😄

[26-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess that all people then will be extra happy

[26-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Caglio#3337
to exchange their coins every time

[26-Nov-18 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Caglio If you feel that *y* coins shouldn't exist after *x* coins are created, then why are you even here? (after all Komodo is the *y* to ZEC's *x*)...

[26-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Caglio#3337
and lost a small percentage

[26-Nov-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
how all these coins interact... that is not really known yet, maybe a lot of them wont have much usage outside of the corporate discount aspect

[26-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Caglio#3337
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Well you feel like the best thing for bitcoin is to get under 1200$, I think its not

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Caglio#3337
And a pain in the ass still

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Caglio#3337
For a normal person

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Caglio#3337
They are pain in the ass

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Coinbase is a pain in the ass, dExes are even bigger

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Caglio#3337
That is correct

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Caglio#3337
In few years maybe

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Not sure how my personal view of the value of CoinX has any relation to the question I asked
`If you feel that y coins shouldn't exist after x coins are created, then why are you even here? (after all Komodo is the y to ZEC's x)...`

[26-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Caglio#3337
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and on the other hand, if you cant understand my point of view, or what am I trying to point, there is no real need for me to even continue this ( :

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
too many coins exist, i think most can agree with that

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there is no real need for me to even continue this`
continue would imply that you started...

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but that doesnt mean we wont get even more of them

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Caglio#3337
Except computer genie

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Caglio#3337
He cant agree with it

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the barrier to entry is too small

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Caglio#3337
We need 10 000 more shitcoins, so normal people get lost in a sea of shitcoins

{Reactions}
👌 

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Caglio#3337
So they dont even find out about good projects like Komodo

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont need it, but we will get it

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Caglio#3337
cos they got burnt on 10 000 others

[26-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a bit like spam

[26-Nov-18 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Komodo is termed a "shitcoin"; so, again, why are you even here?

[26-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
easy to create, makes the spammer a bit of money

[26-Nov-18 09:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
He is probably just here to bask in your sunshiny disposition, genie.

that could well be 😄

[26-Nov-18 09:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Its such a treat

[26-Nov-18 09:08 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I think you misread, he didn't say Komodo is a shitcoin

[26-Nov-18 09:08 PM] Caglio#3337
He is just trolling cos he doesnt have anything better to do with him

[26-Nov-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@PHBA2061 he didn't, no; however, to many it is

[26-Nov-18 09:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats my bald guess

[26-Nov-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My point is that it's a vague, useless term

[26-Nov-18 09:08 PM] Caglio#3337
bald is prolly a wrong word, sorry not a native english speaker

[26-Nov-18 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Actually I stopped coding a sapling-ready stratum just for this...

[26-Nov-18 09:09 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyways, like I stated once, I believe in this project, however I am sure we would fare much better if there werent constant : new and revolutionary coins, that actually do nothing, nothing at all

[26-Nov-18 09:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I believe in this project` said 10000 other people about the other 2071 coins on CoinMarketAds

[26-Nov-18 09:10 PM] Caglio#3337
@Deleted User I hope ur right with this, time will tell :/

[26-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Caglio#3337
Most of them got burnt @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 cos thats what happens with "new revolutionary coins"

[26-Nov-18 09:12 PM] Caglio#3337
While we are at that, do you think my dealer will accept same coin for both weed and cocaine, or I will have to exchange LTC in 2 different ones ?

[26-Nov-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You do get that everything you've said just supports my point about BTC because it all applies to BTC, right?

[26-Nov-18 09:13 PM] Caglio#3337
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I never used BTC in my life

[26-Nov-18 09:14 PM] Caglio#3337
I owned 10$ of it when I joined coinbase over friend refferals link

[26-Nov-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`While we are at that, do you think my dealer will accept same coin for both weed and cocaine, or I will have to exchange LTC in 2 different ones ?`
Perhaps if you did less of each, then you'd have a more realistic notion than `there should only be 10 cryptos`...

[26-Nov-18 09:14 PM] Caglio#3337
@Deleted User if everything is simplified, it will work, otherwise it wont

[26-Nov-18 09:15 PM] Caglio#3337
I did a lot of less due my investment in crypto

[26-Nov-18 09:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Damn if I invested everything I ever had, I guess I wouldnt even do it @ first place 😃

[26-Nov-18 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I did a lot of less due my investment in crypto`
Next time don't buy high and sell low 😉

[26-Nov-18 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
use your currency as currency

[26-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh no worries, no other time

[26-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont need boxingcoin for my gloves

[26-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Nor dopecoin for my drugs

[26-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Also I dont need to pay 12 different taxes just to use it, nor there is possibility it gets lost, also it doesnt lag when servers go down

[26-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Caglio#3337
However I totally want a milk coin, to buy my milk from a local farmer

[26-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Nov-18 09:19 PM] Caglio#3337
He is trying to roast me here for no particular reason, I mean I can probably give few, but there is no point

[26-Nov-18 09:19 PM] Caglio#3337
But thankfully there are other people that can debate normally here 😃

[26-Nov-18 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Caglio you seem to have a real issue with conflating things 🙄

[26-Nov-18 09:20 PM] crumb#2550

Ok just one stupid question before I head out to work
