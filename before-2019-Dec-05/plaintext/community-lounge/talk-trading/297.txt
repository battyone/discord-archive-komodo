That is why the saying goes like: dont invest what you can not afford to lose.

[20-Nov-18 09:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Should have taken the money for the loans at least and let the rest ride it

[20-Nov-18 09:26 PM] Markus#5464
in his case i think it was more that he was too greedy for profits so he didnt cut his  profit in time ^^

[20-Nov-18 09:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think there are a lot of people wishing they sold in january

[20-Nov-18 09:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or at least a part

[20-Nov-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
cost average in, cost average out

[20-Nov-18 09:39 PM] jspook16#3059
What happened?

[20-Nov-18 09:40 PM] jspook16#3059
Oh no.... it's over.

[20-Nov-18 09:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I bought some dignity, read some rumours they were going to be listed on binance in the coming week or two

[20-Nov-18 09:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Gambooooool

[20-Nov-18 09:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Other then that averaging down other positions

[20-Nov-18 09:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And getting some verus

[20-Nov-18 09:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Always regretted not buying earlier

[20-Nov-18 09:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Now is the perfect time üòÉ

[20-Nov-18 09:56 PM] ryman112#0068
If it wasn't right before the holidays and my slow time at work I would be buying this up.  However the stars have not aligned for me.

[20-Nov-18 10:13 PM] fd#7444
the dump today wasn't retail capitulation unless it came from someone very wealthy

[20-Nov-18 10:13 PM] fd#7444
someone really big destroyed a lot of Bitcoin days on November 15th, which is a day after the dump

[20-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Destroyed?

[20-Nov-18 10:15 PM] fd#7444

[20-Nov-18 10:15 PM] fd#7444
you can see the huge spikes in August and November of 2017

[20-Nov-18 10:16 PM] fd#7444
which makes sense but humorously implies that they didn't sell anywhere near the top

[20-Nov-18 10:18 PM] fd#7444
I've been in the game for awhile.  today's dump was one person. someone big has been unloading for awhike and is accelerating because retail is starting to capitulate

[20-Nov-18 10:18 PM] fd#7444
this is why we can't have nice things

[20-Nov-18 10:18 PM] fd#7444
like ETFs

[20-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There is also someone on the other side of the trade

[20-Nov-18 10:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So everyone dumping retail or whale or whatever, there is someone on the other side with the means and time to accumulate üòÉ

[20-Nov-18 10:53 PM] fd#7444
obviously there is a buyer and a seller but only one of them is fervent

[20-Nov-18 10:54 PM] fd#7444
the ratio of market sells to buys is like 2:1 right now

[20-Nov-18 11:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
Seems like its not gonna stop anytime soon

[20-Nov-18 11:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
its gotta stop, friend.  if it doesn't, i swear i will cry

[20-Nov-18 11:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am kicking myself for all of my dollar cost averaging this year.  if my crystal ball had been working, I would have waited until now and filled giant, santa sized bags

[20-Nov-18 11:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
i bought a few hundred bucks worth of goodies today.  so thats something.  but i wish it were a few thousand

[20-Nov-18 11:11 PM] actionslacks#4072

[20-Nov-18 11:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
that is a frightening phrase.  Turbo Bogg'd.  sounds potentially sexual

[20-Nov-18 11:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
you speak true

[20-Nov-18 11:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
I applaud your courage for reaching for those falling knives. I‚Äôm not that brave, yet.

[20-Nov-18 11:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am already mostly stubs

[20-Nov-18 11:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
i thought my approach was DCA this year, but apparently that was just a long game of knife catching

[20-Nov-18 11:18 PM] meatspoon#7860

what about working the line at a Red Dildo factory?  We are all already really familiar with the product, at least in a metaphorical way

i like that marketing tag line

[20-Nov-18 11:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
it is also lube absorbant

[20-Nov-18 11:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
so no matter how much you lube it, doesnt matter.  dry as a bone

[20-Nov-18 11:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
At least We will always have humor to curb the pain.

[20-Nov-18 11:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I bought at 4350.   I almost did at 5k. Shoulda waited longer.

[20-Nov-18 11:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
talk of dildos makes everything better

[20-Nov-18 11:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am seeing a price right now of 4500 or so.  4350 might not be bad.  unless the floor drops out again

[20-Nov-18 11:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
i got a little pissant order filled on Gemini at 4080

[20-Nov-18 11:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I should wait for confirmation.

[20-Nov-18 11:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The only confirmation I wait for in trading is confirmation my send tx has been received.

[20-Nov-18 11:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm bad at trading.

[20-Nov-18 11:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
trading is hard.  I did some mock paper trades this year for a couple months, pencil and paper shit.  and i might have broken even.

[20-Nov-18 11:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
Should woulda coulda is just self mutilation at this point.

[20-Nov-18 11:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
Sold enough in the summer of 17 to have had nearly set me for life if i had waited.

[20-Nov-18 11:35 PM] Markus#5464
maybe CSW's statement about btc dropping to 1000 was not a joke at all ^^

[20-Nov-18 11:40 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so CSW is selling his stash?

[20-Nov-18 11:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
well, if CSW didn't say anything about btc price dropping to $1000, the chance of it happening may be less

[21-Nov-18 12:30 AM] fd#7444
non leveraged buys are safe

[21-Nov-18 12:30 AM] fd#7444
it could get uglier before rainbows and lollipops though

[21-Nov-18 12:31 AM] fd#7444
this is the sickest drawdown bitcojn has ever seen

[21-Nov-18 12:40 AM] bishop#9773
@fd no it isn't (in reference to the drawdown)

[21-Nov-18 12:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
Perhaps in absolute $ amounts, but many of us have been around long enough to see much more severe price swings in btc itself.

[21-Nov-18 12:44 AM] bishop#9773
Correct... I think it is only fair to measure drawdown as a percentage. That way you can relatively compare if you bought the highs from cycle to cycle

[21-Nov-18 12:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What is the % drawdown compared to other btc downturns?

Bitcoin Dark is a great name for a coin, is it possible to revive a new coin under that name?

[21-Nov-18 01:33 AM] fd#7444
3 daily candles outside the bbands in a row, completely opened and closed outside

[21-Nov-18 01:33 AM] fd#7444
first time ever

[21-Nov-18 01:33 AM] ryman112#0068
Will we see eth under a 100 bucks?  Looks like it could happen.  And if so when would it be considered dead?

[21-Nov-18 01:33 AM] fd#7444
thats another 25% down

[21-Nov-18 01:33 AM] fd#7444
it might seems like only 20 bucks
