im sure exchanges like binance have algorithms to find those funds whereever they get transfered to and keep them in a list

[14-Jun-19 03:22 PM] Markus#5464
so they will always know if someone try to deposit then it gets flagged or so

[14-Jun-19 03:22 PM] bishop#9773
Perhaps, but you're speculating more than anything

[14-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
i just dont see how a exchange like binance would not have such systems

[14-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
they definitely have the resources to do all of that

[14-Jun-19 03:25 PM] PTYX#6840
Binance doesn't, Chainanalysis and Elliptic does and Binance uses them.

[14-Jun-19 03:25 PM] PTYX#6840
Ciphertrace too

[14-Jun-19 03:27 PM] bishop#9773
Always comes back to why having fungibility is paramount and public ledgers are double-edged swords

[14-Jun-19 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
there has to be mechanisms of preventing the laundering of stolen, hacked, or tainted funds.

[14-Jun-19 03:29 PM] PTYX#6840
i like the idea of having complete privacy but i don't like the idea of trading with someone and receiving stolen funds with no way of checking that

[14-Jun-19 03:29 PM] nael55#5863
iirc, bisq users have had that problem

[14-Jun-19 03:29 PM] bishop#9773
Hence my thought on local blacklists to prevent you from transacting with a bad counterparty

[14-Jun-19 03:30 PM] bishop#9773
Now that would also put the burden on you to know what addresses not to do business with but that's a whole other problem to solve for

[14-Jun-19 03:32 PM] bishop#9773
Probably require some sort of logic about flow-through utxos and % taint with the threshold determined by the user. Just throwing ideas out.

[14-Jun-19 03:32 PM] PTYX#6840
yea i was thinking of a scenario. a business purchasing bitcoin on the dex. the business ends up buying funds from a known business in Venezuela o any country blacklisted by the US. In a dex, they would have no way of making a decision whether the trade is "legal"

[14-Jun-19 03:32 PM] PTYX#6840
if the trade is fulfilled and later the business if found to have done business with a person or business in the blacklisted country, it could land them in big trouble.

[14-Jun-19 03:33 PM] bishop#9773
yeah, fortunately, we are still early on in the game to figure out some of these larger, downstream issues

[14-Jun-19 03:34 PM] bishop#9773
The forcing of KYC, especially with for US citizens, shouldn't have been surprising. It was always bound to happen and more or less a factor of timing

[14-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
DEX for Pirate!

[14-Jun-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
this is all very bullish for PIRATE

[14-Jun-19 03:39 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
CEX is bad because they can be hacked and steal your coins. Now DEX is bad because said hacker can sell your coins without impunity? At this point crypto trading will be conducted behind Wallmart huddled around a barrel.

[14-Jun-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
tainted coins will just harm the least technically sophisticated

[14-Jun-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and could potentially have significant negative consequences for a coins overall value

[14-Jun-19 03:42 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
You're right. typed it so fast didn't even noticed.

[14-Jun-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i said those coins should be treated as a bounty

[14-Jun-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is not illegal in any jurisdiction. KMD is 100% fungible

[14-Jun-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
I basically bought most of the stolen coins, the exact total seems to be about 750k, a bit under a million, but we have other donors that have come forward too.

[14-Jun-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is best for KMD that we remove the taint from these coins

[14-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Did you offer to buy the stolen KMD or did he dump them and you had a buy wall up?

[14-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Malti#3948
and you see it as a bounty for discovering a security weakness?

[14-Jun-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i am putting up my funds to replace the lost coins to users

[14-Jun-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
that shifts the theft from the users to me, in a sense

[14-Jun-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and if i say i wont be considering them illegal, then it seems they are ok coins to have

otherwise he would have had a less valued stack

[14-Jun-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i only made decisions based on what is best for users

[14-Jun-19 03:53 PM] jansako#3330
many people have trouble seeing what is best for users is not the same as what may seem to be at the heat of the moment

[14-Jun-19 03:54 PM] jansako#3330
many would want to lash out, go attack the hackers & such

[14-Jun-19 03:54 PM] jansako#3330

is anybody using NordVPN , any bad things?

[14-Jun-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
finished todays refunds, only about a dozen. it seems most are stuck waiting for users to send the smartdust from old address to new address. until that is done, not much more refunds can happen.
BTC is done except for 2 claims, i am waiting info on

Sadly my thoughts on the #Binance thing are not so positive. 

Even if USA residents will get a dedicated exchange most likely it will:

- Not have access to all the coins.
- Not have access to margin trading.
- Not have access to IEO's.
- Have a super-exhaustive KYC.

Im seriously considering just dumping my KMD. Too many Agama wallet problems. And the KMD token really has no utility in the ecosystem. Idk I‚Äôve always loved Komodo but I‚Äôm having a hard time finding reasons to keep it

Tokenomics are for tokens, not for coins!
I see a lot of questions about if KMD doesnt charge any KMD for usage of its platform ‚Äúwhy should anybody hodl KMD‚Äù. Implicit in the‚Ä¶

[14-Jun-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a 0% KMD tax is a bit on the low side, but that doesnt mean that charging big taxes is any good idea, especially during the high growth adoption phase

[14-Jun-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the best way to kill economic activity (other than carpet bombing)?

[14-Jun-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, for sure. but that wouldnt be considered any utility by zoroaster as he believes dPoW has no utility

[14-Jun-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
within the komodo ecosystem, KMD is universally used for commerce

[14-Jun-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a micro-economy, with KMD as the base currency

[14-Jun-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
you know this if you ever did work in exchange for KMD, or sold something for KMD

[14-Jun-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so as the komodo ecosystem grows, the usage of KMD grows, just within the ecosystem

[14-Jun-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a network effect of N * N

"new project brings in their set of new people" I referred to this in regards to growth in users of DEX

more porject more users more volume more project more users etc

[14-Jun-19 05:25 PM] Zoroaster#5093
But if any KMD ecosystem sidechain can just randomly ‚Äújump ship‚Äù from the KMD ecosystem, then how is KMD the base currency?

[14-Jun-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
inertia

[14-Jun-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it is open source

adding things that would make projects want to jump ship, that is what you recommend?

do you think any ETH project enjoys paying $5 txfees for their projects transactions?

[14-Jun-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if people in the ecosystem are using KMD, then it is the base currency of the ecosystem

[14-Jun-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i see a fair amount of KMD based transactions in public

[14-Jun-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
and in private there must be a lot more

[14-Jun-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not about charging taxes to projects that join the ecosystem

[14-Jun-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it is to help projects that join the ecosystem do as well as they can
