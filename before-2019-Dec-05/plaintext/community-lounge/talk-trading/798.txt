or hvar

[21-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Caglio#3337
i would accept it for apartment rent and a waterpark we have

[21-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Malti#3948
we, at work, actually created a merchant application that allows them to easily accept payment in our 'crypto' (we're building city specific stablecoins that are backed on escrow accounts). Merchants can accept CITY X coin (that is earned by recycling e.g.) and then translate it into fiat

[21-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Caglio#3337
(we - family )

[21-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337
@Malti that is the idea

[21-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337
also that discount makes ppl trade it

[21-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337
and next summer maybe whole island will accept kmd

[21-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Caglio#3337
which will definately make ppl think more
