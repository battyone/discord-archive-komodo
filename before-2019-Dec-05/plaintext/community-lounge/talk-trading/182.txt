[01-Oct-18 02:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so far I only sold 1 order in last 48 hrs

[01-Oct-18 02:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems to be flat at 0.1 and/or 0.11

[01-Oct-18 02:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Weekdays should bring renewed interest

[01-Oct-18 02:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

How much are you looking to buy?

[01-Oct-18 03:01 AM] KSanJuan#9608
1-2k.

[01-Oct-18 03:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can do 2k PIRATE for 240 KMD_

[01-Oct-18 03:06 AM] KSanJuan#9608
That'll end up on the upper end, but I'm game.  Out of town till tomorrow evening.

[01-Oct-18 03:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You might could find a lower price in #deleted-channel

[01-Oct-18 03:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Given the flux in hash, there's no telling what my prices will be tomorrow

[01-Oct-18 03:14 AM] KSanJuan#9608
Tell me about it! Airborne tomorrow otherwise I'd have my Agama open days ago for the 15-777 deal.

[01-Oct-18 03:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wouldn't know how to act if I could leave town for more than 36 hrs

What’s komodos main goal for 2019? Had 2 friends link me tweets from someone “won’t mention kmd again. Big things coming, hint look at their main goal for 2019”

[01-Oct-18 09:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
world domination?

[01-Oct-18 09:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aside from that, cc going live on mainnet, market maker 2.0; mm2.0 allowing for mobile dex, mobile wallets with integrated dex etc...

[01-Oct-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and most possibly sapling upgrade

[01-Oct-18 09:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
jl buying a small country just to prove the point that kmd can handle the transactions etc

Get a pilot’s license, buy a nice used cessna, and you can do both. Just get an island with enough room for a runway.

[01-Oct-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
or just get a vtol

[01-Oct-18 10:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
I’m imagining a helicopter pad on top of the penthouse.  Maybe when we hit $100

[01-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
vtol have much bigger range than a helicopter

[01-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
when I fly an aircraft, it is always a vtol

[01-Oct-18 10:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
Idk wtf chaturbate is either. I’m sure it is very disturbing

[01-Oct-18 10:41 AM] actionslacks#4072

Chaturbate is a new version of chatroullette if i understand correctly

[01-Oct-18 12:02 PM] SHossain#0007

Vrsc is at 2200 sats

Last trade offer on pirate I saw was .09kmd/arrr

[01-Oct-18 01:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
Nicehash mining cost was briefly at 0.17 USD apparently

[01-Oct-18 01:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
11710 sats * 0.09 = 1594 sats

WTB 2000 Pirate @0.1 KMD

[01-Oct-18 03:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@paradigma if you didn't get any, PM me

[01-Oct-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 
1) PIRATE has been at or over 0.1 KMD for days now
2) Conversion value of CoinA to CoinB as they both relate to a volatile, non-included CoinC is silly (especially when trading for CoinD)

[01-Oct-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX the current fixed price on NH for 5M sol/s is $3333.51 per day

[01-Oct-18 03:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
So that would mean at avg 50msol/sec 0.09 USD / pirate?

[01-Oct-18 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
no wonder miners are so eager to sell at 0.08, it is like a massive 5% profit

[01-Oct-18 03:35 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes that suggests at 40msol its a bit of profit. Looks like the 40msols is currently a good avg.

[01-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
5% profit if there are no pool fees **and** NH's share diff multiplier doesn't screw the user out of valid block-finding shares

[01-Oct-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't count how many times their multiplier has screwed Alright out of blocks on different chains we've worked on stuff on/with 😕

[01-Oct-18 10:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
