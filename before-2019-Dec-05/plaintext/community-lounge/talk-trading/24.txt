How many kmd can you mine a day with a z9 ðŸ˜‚ or would it be better to mine another coin and buy kmd with profits. Might grab my first ever mining rig for lols

[27-Jun-18 11:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe Iâ€™ll liquidate some shitcoins

[27-Jun-18 11:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bitmain accept BTC?

[27-Jun-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"How many kmd can you mine a day with a z9"
36% of whatever the calculator you use says ðŸ˜›

[27-Jun-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`KSol/S(avg)     16.48`
ðŸ˜Ž

[27-Jun-18 11:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Finish that stratum

[27-Jun-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
from a 10K unit?

[27-Jun-18 11:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iâ€™ll direct my z9â€™s at it

[27-Jun-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
10k at 450 setting, 16k+ at 750

[27-Jun-18 11:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What are those figures

[27-Jun-18 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Watts?

[27-Jun-18 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Overclocking these things somehow?

[27-Jun-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
technically they call it "Frequency", but it has more to do with voltage than frequency

[27-Jun-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, basically overclock same as a GPU or CPU

[27-Jun-18 11:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What are you running these on a freq drive or something?

[27-Jun-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"a freq drive"?

[27-Jun-18 11:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Variable frequency drive, but never mind, you said itâ€™s a setting you can adjust?

[27-Jun-18 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
set it to 10,000!

[27-Jun-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, all antminers have a "Advanced Configuration" page

[27-Jun-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol 750 is the max they preset, @ 775, it errors enough that it's less hash than if you set to 650

[27-Jun-18 11:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Get yourself a dewar of LN2 and set it to 10,000

[27-Jun-18 11:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do you run additional cooling for these units at the higher setting?

[27-Jun-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, they have a variable fan curve coded in (for what bm coding is worth ðŸ˜› )

[27-Jun-18 11:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And 7k a month?

[27-Jun-18 11:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I could use some supplemental income

[27-Jun-18 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not 7k just off 1 mini
7k off my setup in total

[27-Jun-18 11:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I know

[27-Jun-18 11:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wonder what I could spit out income wise with 3 z9â€™s

[27-Jun-18 11:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
$1399 per, arent they?

[27-Jun-18 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
$850

[27-Jun-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
quick math:
3 should roll in ~ 475 KMD per month

[27-Jun-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
by wtm calcs and * 0.36

[27-Jun-18 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
which in reality turns out to be more, but always figure for worst

[27-Jun-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I figured ~3 months to +ROI

[27-Jun-18 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the key to remember is scale
+ROI holds the same for 1, 10, or 100
So, what you can get out per month depends on what you lay out up front

[27-Jun-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The plus side for me is that if I'm totally wrong about buying 45 more, I'm just burning last year's profits; nothing out of pocket

[27-Jun-18 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh wow 3 months is heaps good LOL.

[27-Jun-18 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Whats the heat and noise like? Would a studio apartment suffer heaps, or would be fine leaving them in a corner LOL

[27-Jun-18 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
closer to 4 if BTC goes back under 6k

[27-Jun-18 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ASICs are not for in-your-home miners

[27-Jun-18 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Wait what

[27-Jun-18 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
heat isn't bad, but they have the same 6k RPM fans that S9s have

[27-Jun-18 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
4 month roi with the prices these days?

[27-Jun-18 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
well that just killed my plans

[27-Jun-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
get a cone of silence

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜œ 

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"4 month roi with the prices these days?"
With these prices **and** only mining KMD

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I may have heard something similar in our data centers

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
Those are crazy roi though.. So if I never planned on selling kmd in the first place

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Feeeeeek

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
liquidating my holdings now, claiming tax loss, getting back my kmd within 3 to 4 months

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
worst case scenario

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You need ear plugs if theyâ€™re like the ones Iâ€™m thinking of

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
then profit afterwards? ðŸ¤”

[27-Jun-18 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Can put it in my warehouse

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Can save on heating in winters

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Win/win

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iâ€™d stick them in my storage room

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@ 70F ambient, the fan on mine is running ~4k RPM right now

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
that 4 month take into account electricity?

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thats crazy LOL I always thought miners took 2 years or so for roi

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Make that 5 months

[27-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
after looking at gpus and the likes quite a while ago

[27-Jun-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Deleted User they only run ~330-400 watts

[27-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
My gpus smoked themselves after a few months

[27-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bad investment

[27-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Chinese capacitors failed more than likely

[27-Jun-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
How long do these z9 last for estimate?

[27-Jun-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
cheap chinese crap thatll break after a year or 2

[27-Jun-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
or will last a few

[27-Jun-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yall putting ideas in my head

[27-Jun-18 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"My gpus smoked themselves after a few months"
I hear this all the time and think I'm the luckiest guy in the world
I run my GPUs flat out, just under fail point, and haven't lost a single one

[27-Jun-18 12:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I mined murraycoin

[27-Jun-18 12:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fucking dumbass

[27-Jun-18 12:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
(Me)

[27-Jun-18 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
26 months before I had the 1st S7LN board die, too

[27-Jun-18 12:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What supporting hardware, if any, does the z9 need?

[27-Jun-18 12:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is it standalone?

[27-Jun-18 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a modem

[27-Jun-18 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ðŸ˜›

[27-Jun-18 12:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Any chance they come with a wireless card?

[27-Jun-18 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, they are just "plug and play"; you just hook up the Ethernet and config to a pool

[27-Jun-18 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no on the wireless

[27-Jun-18 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
but you could get a custom bb and get wireless if you want to double the cost ðŸ˜›

[27-Jun-18 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
are we looking at a lot of z9 purchases cause of new release and a very high increase of difficulty coming? Or is it just gonna stay around this level

[27-Jun-18 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I see literally no negatives to selling kmd to buy these and mine them if roi is under a year for someone who plans to hold ðŸ˜®

[27-Jun-18 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sounds too good to be true ðŸ˜‚  and I always fall for shit thats too good to be true

[27-Jun-18 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
purchase levels are going to depend a lot on what ZEC does, imo

[27-Jun-18 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If ZEC accepts the environment change then the Z9 will be the new 1080Ti

[27-Jun-18 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If ZEC follows the pack and switches K & N values, then the rest will depend on if BM and other makers decide to invest in adding RAM

[27-Jun-18 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If anyone adds RAM and variables, I see ASICs being the new standard just like for BTC

[27-Jun-18 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and if they're really smart, they'll sell control boards separate in order to "mod" any existing units

[27-Jun-18 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Even if RAM jumps the price 10x, it's still a better long-term investment than the same amount of hash in GPUs

[27-Jun-18 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Smart $ buys 100 units, mines ZEC, trades it for KMD, then mines KMD at the point of +ROI

[27-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
They only do 1 per address aye? Just need to find mates to ship it to

[27-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
or is it 1 per card

[27-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
got me interested

[27-Jun-18 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, they only did that 1 per thing for the 1st couple days

[27-Jun-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to get a few z9 to mine KMD, but the noise put me off... GPU's on server PSU was bad enough

[27-Jun-18 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, all things are relative
A drag racer is louder than a Camero too

[27-Jun-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive been thinking of some what to use a 2ft fan with a funnel pointed into a row of them or soemthing... but that just starts being silly
