or something

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] Tek#5253
but it has to do with the lite wallet and SPV. electrum servers

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] Tek#5253
a lot of time electrum servers have been hacked

[05-Jun-19 02:59 AM] Tek#5253
so possibly seed phrasese entered in agama wallet lately have been unsecurely stored on electrum servers

[05-Jun-19 02:59 AM] Tek#5253
or something like that

[05-Jun-19 02:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
fucking eth gets hacked for tens of millions once a month

[05-Jun-19 03:00 AM] Tek#5253
ETH didn't get hacked.

[05-Jun-19 03:00 AM] Vertigo#0439
Plain text in Google docs?

[05-Jun-19 03:00 AM] Tek#5253
I mean ETH got hacked a few times

[05-Jun-19 03:00 AM] Tek#5253
but not for millons a month.

[05-Jun-19 03:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ETH got hacked for real once when the DAO happened

[05-Jun-19 03:00 AM] Tek#5253
^ yeah that was a real hackening

[05-Jun-19 03:01 AM] Tek#5253
tfw its getting light, ive been up all night

[05-Jun-19 03:01 AM] Tek#5253
and my kmd fundus are not yet confirmed

[05-Jun-19 03:01 AM] Vertigo#0439
But not kmd for f sakes we are the delayed proof of work security Sherman tank

[05-Jun-19 03:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
or the guy that orphaned a bunch with a smart contract error

[05-Jun-19 03:02 AM] Vertigo#0439
Was that ETH or EOS?

[05-Jun-19 03:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
it was eth. eos is it's own dumpster fire

[05-Jun-19 03:04 AM] Alecandro#1179
Well we are going back up now, everyone calm down ðŸ˜ƒ

[05-Jun-19 03:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
we'll see what happened. It's hard to make judgements based on what we know now, which is nothing.

[05-Jun-19 03:04 AM] ryman112#0068
Well someone broke the news on reddit 11min ago

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What a pain in the dick

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Does ocean use the same block storage location as agama?

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Need to know where to dump the bootstrap

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes same storage location

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Komodo\BEER
on windows
.komodo/BEER
on unix

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] Tek#5253
I think that CSW has trading bots on a lot of big caps alts

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] Tek#5253
that try to trade the price down

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] Tek#5253
this action on BCH is just weird

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] Tek#5253
some 100 btc sell order pops up and pushes down. the moment there's a decently sized counter off at the buy side it quickly dissapears

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Tek#5253
lmao the 0k bch buyer just bought 1000 BCH from that bot

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Tek#5253
7k*

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] actionslacks#4072

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Tek#5253
is it mooning?

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Tek#5253
im watching BCH shit bout to happen

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i swapped half kmd for bch

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
gonna swap the rest in like 30 more confirms

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] Tek#5253
you already have confirmed???

[05-Jun-19 03:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's not dumping yet

[05-Jun-19 03:14 AM] Tek#5253
i still need60 more confirmations

[05-Jun-19 03:15 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no one trusts kmd anymore, so of course theyre swappign it for arr

[05-Jun-19 03:15 AM] Tek#5253
@webworker01 how exactly is KMD developed? is the entire pipeline on amazon?

[05-Jun-19 03:16 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Chill man hacking news in crypto is like daily thing

[05-Jun-19 03:17 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
I have seen so many

[05-Jun-19 03:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's not a hack yet as far as we know, just a vulnerability

[05-Jun-19 03:17 AM] bishop#9773
No one knows anything, we're all speculating

[05-Jun-19 03:18 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
All we know is satoshi is a drug boss

[05-Jun-19 03:18 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yea exactly. Was very urgent, but could just be the teams effort to help keep a vulnerability turning into something worse

[05-Jun-19 03:18 AM] Tek#5253
so you don't know what a pipeline is?

[05-Jun-19 03:18 AM] Tek#5253
holy shit man

[05-Jun-19 03:18 AM] Tek#5253
> muh great tech

[05-Jun-19 03:19 AM] Tek#5253
im trying to figure out how KMD develops. since you boast about "Muh we so decentralized" the only optoin I could think of to work together on this effectively is building a pipeline on amazon.

[05-Jun-19 03:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is there any report of stolen funds?

[05-Jun-19 03:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
none that I have heard

[05-Jun-19 03:19 AM] bishop#9773
@Tek  have you been on github?

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] Tek#5253
what a fucking retarded question

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] Tek#5253
fuck off

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] bishop#9773
well, if you did, you would see how development is structured

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek i develop with a fun tool invented in the 1960's when people were on LSD, it's called `vi`

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] Tek#5253
No I am an ex devops engineer

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh shizzle!

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] Tek#5253
but if you don't even know what a pipeline is

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek we use mostly bare metal but there are no rules for notaries

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] Tek#5253
as notaary operatir

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
There are no rules for notaries, but most use bare metal

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] Tek#5253
I didn't have to switch carreers I just quit my job

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
some use $5 DO droplets

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] Tek#5253
but you don't have a pipeline?

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek that word has many definitions across industries

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] Tek#5253
lke. automatic deploy testing

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
what exactly do you mean

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
ah, ok

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] Tek#5253
complete pipeline

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, we have Travis CI

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
we don't have Continuous Deployment

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
we have Continuous Integration and builds, tho

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] Tek#5253
oh ok

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
CD in blockchain world is like dancing on knives

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] Tek#5253
yes

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
lulz

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
it could be that when our tests pass all KMD servers are auto-updated, that is CD

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
and it's also very scary

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] Tek#5253
obviously you just deploy to testnet autoamtically

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] Tek#5253
then you share the binaries with the actual network

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
testnets are for coins that can't make coins effortlessly, in KMD world we make test chains

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Why is kmd is not dropping

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™ because nobody can figure out their wallets yet

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] bishop#9773
probably confirms

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Can you guys dump to 1 satoshi

[05-Jun-19 03:24 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
I can buy

[05-Jun-19 03:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
because nothing is real in crypto world

[05-Jun-19 03:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
I see it dumped 1k sat, but that isn't much when it's over 20k

[05-Jun-19 03:24 AM] bishop#9773
FICTIONAL CHARACTERS

[05-Jun-19 03:24 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yea maybe not everyone is trying to sell haha. A lot of people probably just want to move their coins

[05-Jun-19 03:24 AM] Alecandro#1179
Out of Agama to be safe

[05-Jun-19 03:25 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Wtb kmd at 1sat

[05-Jun-19 03:25 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912

I do think you can do automatic deployment too.

[05-Jun-19 03:25 AM] Tek#5253
but you will have to deliver playbooks or whatnot to your nodes
