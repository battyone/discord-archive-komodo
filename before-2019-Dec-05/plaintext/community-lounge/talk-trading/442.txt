[25-Feb-19 02:07 AM] Likewise#6767
The BTC sell of yseterdat brought us back to well where we were a week ago. No real progress, that is what futures can do to a low marcap market

[25-Feb-19 02:07 AM] Likewise#6767
I'm starting to get a hatred against BTC lol

[25-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Likewise#6767

[25-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Likewise#6767

thanks man, same

I want to accumulate KMD badly. Its a great project. My only reservation is the it was .56 less than 1 month ago. Tough call for sure.

[25-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Likewise#6767
thinking th ebear is not out of the woodworks yet. Observe

[25-Feb-19 02:25 AM] yorklab#7270
I think the only way kmd goes back to .56 is if bitcoin implodes (could happen). But it does appear to me that Komodo is starting to get more awareness of late.

[25-Feb-19 02:26 AM] 74D30#6106
Argeed. If it hits 92 I will most likley pull the trigger

[25-Feb-19 02:29 AM] yorklab#7270
Both the General Manager and the CTO are going to two separate big events next week so perhaps more people will be aware of Komodo by next weekend.

[25-Feb-19 03:34 AM] 74D30#6106

Ripple, Stellar, and Altcoins are all a distraction. Bitcoin is way too far ahead. We should be focused on bitcoin and sidechains

[25-Feb-19 09:58 PM] PTYX#6840

It's unlikely that their price will be affected

[25-Feb-19 10:12 PM] nocturnal#2177
are private wallets harder to hack than exchanges?

[25-Feb-19 10:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
or are exchanges just a better target due to quantity?

@brian_armstrong `Bitcoin is way too far ahead.`
Ahead of what? Bitcoin isn't even ahead when it comes to implementing things Core dreams up. #AtomicSwaps #Komodo
`We should be focused on bitcoin and sidechains`
You mean the thing others have already done? #AheadWhenBehind...

[25-Feb-19 10:41 PM] peritonlogon#7708
what do you mean by private wallet?  A paper wallet  made from a computer and printer not connected to the internet is pretty unhackable as long as you maintain control over the paper.  Ledger wallets are pretty difficult to hack.  Once you start talking about a non-custodial wallet on your phone, I think you're getting closer to  an exchange, only  with a much smaller target.

[25-Feb-19 10:43 PM] nocturnal#2177
i mean like a typical QT wallet

[25-Feb-19 10:44 PM] nocturnal#2177
with private keys

[25-Feb-19 10:44 PM] peritonlogon#7708
I think those are as secure as the computer they're on.

[25-Feb-19 10:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
hmmm ... so not very 😃

[25-Feb-19 10:45 PM] Alright#0419
offline generated paper wallets or proper hardware wallet seems the best solution

anyone ordered the new ledger nano x?

[25-Feb-19 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
you can write about 30 lines of python on an offline computer that will generate keys. Hook up a printer to this computer, print a couple hundred keys and keep track of them as you use them

[25-Feb-19 10:47 PM] Alright#0419
burn the computer and printer once printed for good measure 👽 👻

[25-Feb-19 10:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
i guess im just wondering how safe crypto really is once exchanges get their shiz together will hackers just move to private wallets

[25-Feb-19 10:48 PM] Alright#0419
exchanges are not inherently less secure

[25-Feb-19 10:48 PM] Alright#0419
just a bigger target

[25-Feb-19 10:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
thats what i figured

[25-Feb-19 10:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
meaning wallts arent very safe

Well, most people don't need to keep thousands of BTC ready to withdraw with an application like an exchange, so there's that.

[25-Feb-19 10:50 PM] nocturnal#2177
if i was a hacker i would just look at top 100 list and start there

[25-Feb-19 10:50 PM] Markus#5464
easier said then done

[25-Feb-19 10:50 PM] nocturnal#2177
i bet

[25-Feb-19 10:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
but if one wallet is as safe as another then could be done

[25-Feb-19 10:51 PM] peritonlogon#7708

So will atomic swaps be available in the full release of the Agama wallet once it comes out of beta?

With the UI upgrade?

[26-Feb-19 02:30 AM] yorklab#7270
If they can make this intuitive to use, hard to imagine anyone in crypto that won't have this on their phone. This is pretty cool.

[26-Feb-19 02:34 AM] Markus#5464
Just wonder how many swaps per sec it can handle

[26-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Markus#5464
incase it becomes huge so it doesnt prevent or slow things down
