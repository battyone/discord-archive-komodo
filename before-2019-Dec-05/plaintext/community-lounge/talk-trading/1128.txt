Decentralized is a meme

total decentralization is impossible. nothing would ever happen.

doesnt BCH have checkpoints in its blockchain that can be used to rollback?

[09-Sep-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[09-Sep-19 01:31 PM] Markus#5464
Then what was the anti reorg protection they applied?

[09-Sep-19 01:31 PM] Markus#5464
during the hash war

[09-Sep-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
reorg limit of 10 blocks?

[09-Sep-19 01:32 PM] Markus#5464
no idea

[09-Sep-19 01:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Markus @blackjok3r i am not a bch expert, but I think they do manually curate checkpoints constantly, or they used to

[09-Sep-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they made 1.. when SV forked...

[09-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, let's see what the code says

[09-Sep-19 01:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
i remember looking at the code once

[09-Sep-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
whoa

[09-Sep-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
BCH has a cli option `-checkpoints` to disable checkpoints, ZEC world doesn't have that

[09-Sep-19 05:39 PM] Lumbi#8378
are 1.3 billion dollar valuations even relevant, if crypto is the future? 😎

how much is that in KMD?

The idea of the original image I assume was that blockstream and the banks are pushing past the limitations of bitcoin.  Komodo does as well albeit in a different manner.

[09-Sep-19 09:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It’s memery ( semiotics)it’s whatever it means to you 😁

[09-Sep-19 09:57 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
it's about innovation and how staying within Bitcoin consensus rules limit blockchain innovation. Bitcoin maximalists want to have monopoly on blockchain and everything should be built by their rules only.

[09-Sep-19 10:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
replacing logos in that image only says, komodo killing satoshi and his innovations, instead of using it and enhancing it or improving it further on his work.

[09-Sep-19 10:12 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I'm sorry you see it that way. As you are one of kmd core devs. it's not about killing, it's about inflexibility of Bitcoin. Black Knight is preventing innovation by guarding the bridge to more innovation. I can understand that all people don't get it. People see things differently.

[09-Sep-19 10:15 PM] Markus#5464
Kmd looking bullish on USD chart, i dont look at that chart so often but we have bullish div that should bring us up to 0.8$

[09-Sep-19 10:27 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
good idea. I'll do that.

[09-Sep-19 10:28 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418

Doesn't KMD need the BTC blockchain to store backups or something like that

[10-Sep-19 12:00 AM] JimD#9272
Or are we just being parasites until the chain gets strong enough to liberate us from BTC

[10-Sep-19 12:13 AM] allbits#5898
Parasites? Transaction fees are paid!

[10-Sep-19 12:14 AM] JimD#9272
Ahh I see.  I guess we are symbiotic then

What’s all that noise about

Time to ballbust the Rolodex, mr toutonghi

[10-Sep-19 12:27 AM] phideas#8309
Maximalism is very strong out there. bc of brutal market conditions many ppl are now turned into BTC maxis. You can be a bitcoiner yet support good innovating projects. Even make profit on them (or loose money). That is a healthy mindset imo. Maximalists wants all coins to die, only one can survive. That is such a narrow mindset. I it is unlikely to happen but I really wish a project arise and flip BTC and clamp down the ego of BTC maxis.

Verus May end up murdering KMD

[10-Sep-19 12:30 AM] JimD#9272
I know but its still here when it was supposed to be dead and gone

[10-Sep-19 12:30 AM] richardt#2807
Out of all the shitcoins, Dogecoin has surprised me the most

[10-Sep-19 12:31 AM] JimD#9272
Yup, even with constant inflation its hovering around #30

[10-Sep-19 12:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I still have a shit ton of feathercoin on BTC-e

Im pretty deep into the shitcoins

After 2017, most people who are still in crypto are huge bagholders

[10-Sep-19 12:33 AM] JimD#9272
I wasn't making enough money in 2017 to play crypto

[10-Sep-19 12:33 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Im still up in fiat since my 2013 incept

[10-Sep-19 12:33 AM] richardt#2807
this is why I don't think another altseason like 2017 will happen

[10-Sep-19 12:33 AM] JimD#9272
The alt season happened because BTC took 8 hours to do transactions during the bubble

[10-Sep-19 12:33 AM] JimD#9272
I don't know that fundamental weakness has been fixed

[10-Sep-19 12:34 AM] JimD#9272
and also massive fees

[10-Sep-19 12:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It happened because of speculative mania

[10-Sep-19 12:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It will happen again

[10-Sep-19 12:34 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, like moths to the flame

[10-Sep-19 12:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[10-Sep-19 12:35 AM] richardt#2807
There's never been more bagholders and people burned after 2017, so idk

[10-Sep-19 12:36 AM] JimD#9272
I mined doge back in 2015 and then get a new PC 🤷

Could be but QNT sure had a run

[10-Sep-19 12:38 AM] JimD#9272
there is some good stuff out there

[10-Sep-19 12:38 AM] JimD#9272
even KMD had a pretty strong run for a bit

[10-Sep-19 12:38 AM] JimD#9272
its all timing

[10-Sep-19 12:38 AM] JimD#9272
thats why I invest somewhat randomly

[10-Sep-19 12:38 AM] JimD#9272
I can't be wrong all the time

[10-Sep-19 12:39 AM] JimD#9272
Just gonna find a good coin having a bad time

[10-Sep-19 12:41 AM] richardt#2807
Altseason will only happen if somehow new investors come in.  That seems unlikely at this point given how many people got burned and how many people know it (crypto media coverage was at all time high during 2017 bubble)
