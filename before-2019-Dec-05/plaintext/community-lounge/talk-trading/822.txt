Pretty sure without tether price would be less then 8k

[22-Jun-19 05:23 PM] actionslacks#4072
tether is the attack vector with which to steal normies' btc

[22-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Markus#5464
i watched a live stream from Willy Woo today who is a blockchain analyst, they had analysed the transactions on btc network last month and most of them were from retail investors

[22-Jun-19 05:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
if it is another tether pump then the rug will be unceremoniously pulled out and the institutional accumulation of btc will begin again.

[22-Jun-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it a couple billion over 6 months really that significant?

[22-Jun-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems a 3% allocation from a 7 trillion dollar pension fund would be quite a bit more significant

[22-Jun-19 05:28 PM] kaks#6612
jl thx for your opinion mate, i appreciate it

[22-Jun-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
all i said was that i watch what is happening and not try to fit it into any preconceived template as this condition is unique and has never happened before, there cannot be any precedent for it on the microscale

[22-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Flint#6435
they will print a fake Fiat as much as they need and while the lawyers will check the real provision of funds - they will make a profit

[22-Jun-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
markets do work in the same way markets always work

[22-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
Another thing is this might be a trap for institutional money to enter into crypto so that they then can crash the price which could scare institutions and regulations away from crypto

[22-Jun-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why we get patterns that are familiar in all the markets

[22-Jun-19 05:31 PM] kaks#6612
maybe you are right of that there are much different of previous and current bullmarket

[22-Jun-19 05:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
A lot of turmoil in the world, could be a hedge against fiat. If institutional investors are getting into crypto more and more then the insanity is only starting

[22-Jun-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus that is the story of the last bull market, they got enough to make the bear

[22-Jun-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
now they have majority, so it will hurt them more to crash it

[22-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Markus#5464
Ok didnt hear it before ðŸ˜„

[22-Jun-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember telling you back at $6k that it is stairstepping up, that is not the usual harmonic oscillation based pattern

[22-Jun-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it was a more controlled infusion of capital, much much more than $2bil from tether

[22-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Markus#5464
ye i remember

[22-Jun-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and i said as long as it keeps going up, it has no reason to correct or follow any TA rules

[22-Jun-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
imagine a swimming pool with water in it

[22-Jun-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
somebody jumps in and makes waves, splashes

[22-Jun-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it pretty soon settles down

[22-Jun-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
usually the market is the normal swimming pool with people jumping into it all the time, but the water level is the same

[22-Jun-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
so the patterns repeat

[22-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus  you noticed it very correctly about the trap!!!

[22-Jun-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
during a storm, the pattern is quite different

[22-Jun-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
all the patterns break down

[22-Jun-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but if this is institutions reallocating a few percent of their portfolio, it isnt a storm or hurricane

[22-Jun-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a tidal wave

[22-Jun-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
to apply people jumping into the swimming pool patterns during a tidal wave, is like trying to apply normal TA patterns during a fundamental revaluation of an asset class

[22-Jun-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not 100% sure we are actually seeing the fundamental revaluation of the crypto asset class

[22-Jun-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but now we have the proper silly regulations, maybe it is getting very close to possible

[22-Jun-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, then there is the facebook thing

[22-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
Is KMD working in any way to get interest from hedge funds and institutional investors?

[22-Jun-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Jun-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
we make the best tech we can make

[22-Jun-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
already a few investment funds are investing

[22-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  interesting is the fact that komodo is often in the top of the Chinese rating of cryptocurrency - do you think this is a real interest in technology or a cunning move for complex price manipulation?

[22-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Markus#5464
if it was for price manipulation kmd would be way higher then this

[22-Jun-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
in china is it true that technology is valued above hype?

[22-Jun-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
at least the people maybe strive for solid tech, but there is a big gamblers in china who wouldnt care about anything other than day trading

[22-Jun-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw KMD was #18 in some SEC rankings of all crypto

[22-Jun-19 05:40 PM] Markus#5464
wow

[22-Jun-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD ranks high in most all the fundamental value rankings, blocktivity, etc

[22-Jun-19 05:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
If there was a more idiot resistant interface I would think fixed income funds would be all over the 5.1% rewards kmd offers.

[22-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think they are allowed to invest in anything but very large marketcap approved cryptos

[22-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
most are not allowed even to get into BTC

[22-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
just got a *all targets hit* / take profit

[22-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
from a signal group

[22-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so BTC would be the first to be accepted by all such groups, unless facebookcoin gets there first

[22-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Markus#5464
but if Libra is going to be more or less a stable coin what makes it worth investing into as a investment fund?

[22-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Tek#5253
heres the message @jl777c

[22-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Tek#5253
7:42 PM] CryptoWolfPack: LONG XBT/USD (mid risk)

First and second targets hit for 20.93% profit âœ… 

10x-20x leverage. 

Buy Range:
10600
10700

Targets:
10850 âœ… 
10900 âœ… 
11050

Stop-Loss:
10450

[22-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it will pay more than negative interest rate, but the facebookcoin has a second coin for the funds

[22-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
which gets a share of all the profits from sales of userdata

[22-Jun-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
or however they will monetize the libra

[22-Jun-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
of course only open to very large investors

[22-Jun-19 05:44 PM] kaks#6612
10x leverage is more safe

[22-Jun-19 05:44 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  Does this "commission" in audit and ratings mean these partners of these major players play the same game? Or are they objective at least in part?

[22-Jun-19 05:44 PM] Markus#5464
didnt u have to make a payment of 10 mil to get acess to a Libra node?

[22-Jun-19 05:44 PM] Markus#5464
read something about it

[22-Jun-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
10 million per masternode

[22-Jun-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
@Flint we were never contacted by the china (or sec) ranking projects

[22-Jun-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ever since 6k, it has been stair stepping its way up, on big volumes coming in, with today triple normal

[22-Jun-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if this makes the mainstream press and the retail buyers come back, then the stair stepping wont work anymore

[22-Jun-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
watch for cautionary news stories as they try to keep the price lower to accumulate more

[22-Jun-19 05:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
bless zuckerberg's evil little heart. he just made btc moon and now shareholders everywhere will be demanding their vested corps make their own crypto's now.

[22-Jun-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Jun-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
now the other corps have something to copy, they will most likely do so

[22-Jun-19 05:49 PM] Tek#5253
BCH to 0.1 BTC by EOY

[22-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Tek#5253
ETH to 0.056 BTC by EOY

[22-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Tek#5253
XMR to 0.02 BTC by EOY

[22-Jun-19 05:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
a white label product with masternode functionality and govt backdoors built in would be a nightmare philosophically but would probably dominate the corp blockchain software market.

[22-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Tek#5253
DASH to 0.03 BTC by EOY

[22-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Tek#5253
You have been warned.

[22-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
kmd to? :troll_lol:

[22-Jun-19 05:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
thanks @Tek

[22-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
I can't make predictions on KMD

[22-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
i really can't

[22-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Tek#5253
its hard

[22-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
if we reach 40k sats its amazing

[22-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Tek#5253
but I would say if the marketing campaign and relesase of antara etc etc is well managed and promoted

[22-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Tek#5253
then id say KMD to 30k sats by EOY

[22-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
40k would mean 3.2x from 12.5k

[22-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
pretty good

[22-Jun-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
@jl777c if you don't like to pay for listing on big cex, how exactly did you manage to get listed on that new big japanese exchange?

[22-Jun-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
also, how did you get on binance? they just added cause CZ investigation team saw how nice kmd is?

[22-Jun-19 05:57 PM] PTYX#6840
Most of the KMD listings were not paid listings

[22-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Tek#5253
none were according to jamerson

[22-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Tek#5253
he didn't explicitly say that

[22-Jun-19 05:57 PM] PTYX#6840
yes, he would know better.

[22-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Tek#5253
but

[22-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Tek#5253
he said he is against paying for listing fees so I guess he never paid any

[22-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
we might have bottomed out

[22-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
nice

[22-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Mark81#4505
Japanese exchange?

[22-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Markus#5464
Liquid

[22-Jun-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
we do occasionally pay nominal fees, we often get deeply discounted offers for listing and if the price is good enough, i am open to it. we certainly dont pay the standard pricing as those are the prices for the ICO projects with millions for listing fees
