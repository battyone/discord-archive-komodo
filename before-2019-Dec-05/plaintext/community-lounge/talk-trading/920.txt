- you can place orders on multiple pairs with the same  coins

[14-Jul-19 03:01 PM] jansako#3330
- no more UTXO hell

Andreas' philosophy is good. He has spread awareness. not much more you can ask for in this space

`Can anyone in a nutshell explain how the new Dex will handle liquidity?`
It will magically force people to want to buy what you're selling when you want to sell it for how much you want to sell it

is etomic still needed for eth swaps? did they figure out how to swap without it?

[14-Jul-19 03:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Publishing a 1kmd for 1 BTC swap offer

[14-Jul-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I thought I saw artem post that etomic will not be needed, but I'm not 100% sure

[14-Jul-19 03:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
:0 I sold half my KMD for etomic

[14-Jul-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
lol

[14-Jul-19 03:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
if mm2 can execute eth swaps without a proxy token... that alone would pump any other project out there.

[14-Jul-19 03:11 PM] Markus#5464
from what i have heard it can?

[14-Jul-19 03:13 PM] Markus#5464
I wonder what happened with KMD listing on Liquid exchange

[14-Jul-19 03:24 PM] yorklab#7270
I just assumed any announcements other than Antara/AtomicDEX would be after the 15th. Get noticed first, then make announcements.

[14-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Markus#5464
@yorklab is full rebrand tomorrow or is it a progress rebrand?

[14-Jul-19 03:26 PM] yorklab#7270
I think it's the beginning of the rebrand, but a pretty major part of it. Letting the world know what Komodo is all about.

[14-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Markus#5464
Ok

[14-Jul-19 03:28 PM] yorklab#7270
They did state "Full rebrand".

[14-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Markus#5464

[14-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Markus#5464
@FlyingDutchman there wont be a official team wallet, the new wallet they said will be the mobile dex wallet

[14-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Markus#5464

I have been using Verus Agama 0.6. something beta for some time -hope there is no major divergence with 0.5.7 - presumably 0.6 beta should become 0.6 regular or so ..

[14-Jul-19 04:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
This is how KMD shows the world they have the best tech... Janky beta wallets

[14-Jul-19 04:39 PM] Sdunbar#5064

Expect retracement to 0.618?

[14-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
that would be a good start

[14-Jul-19 05:49 PM] Mark81#4505
It's a quite likely even. Didn't Bitcoin do same?

[14-Jul-19 05:49 PM] Markus#5464
yes

[14-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Alecandro#1179
orderbook quite interesting right now

[14-Jul-19 06:14 PM] Markus#5464
bears defending 14k pretty hard

[14-Jul-19 06:15 PM] bopicasso#8995
I'm optimistic we will get some big news tomorrow

[14-Jul-19 06:15 PM] bopicasso#8995
Hopefully regarding partnerships or posibly coinbase listing

[14-Jul-19 06:16 PM] Markus#5464
dont think coinbase listing gonna happen anytime soon üòÑ

[14-Jul-19 06:16 PM] bopicasso#8995
Coinbase is looking to add more projects

[14-Jul-19 06:16 PM] Neko#5830
it will depend on partnerships se chainlink

[14-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Markus#5464
kmd already got some heavy partnerships

[14-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Markus#5464
kmd is one of the few crypto projects with advanced aws partnership

[14-Jul-19 06:18 PM] bopicasso#8995
I know they said they are in talks with Fortune 500 companies

[14-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Markus#5464
maybe they release aws marketplace tomorrow so that ppl can create their own kmd chain there

[14-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Neko#5830
crypto is in the intermediate stage where projects with real world usage will leap forward

if its a "start of rebrand"

[14-Jul-19 07:07 PM] Caglio#3337

[14-Jul-19 07:29 PM] bishop#9773
Exactly... people need to stop getting these unrealistic expectations that we are going to go to on a mad run just because one day changes to the next.

[14-Jul-19 07:30 PM] bishop#9773
Rebranding is a process anyway

[14-Jul-19 07:30 PM] jorian#4555
a brand is long term

[14-Jul-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
still, #45 on CMC is a pretty decent spot, compared to the entire last year

[14-Jul-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
and if we are here with BTC dominance at 65%+, it seems to bode well for when it drops below 40%, certainly in fiat terms, but assuming when this happens the rebranding is convinced majority of people that KMD is not just a privacy coin

[14-Jul-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
also yesterday over 50 BTC seems to have been market sold. that wiped out the buy side and it takes a bit of time to recover, though it did bounce back pretty strong

[14-Jul-19 07:32 PM] Markus#5464
i would exclude stable coins so its higher then rank 45 rly, cant rly compare stable coins their suppose to be the way they are

[14-Jul-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
overall recent market performances indicates a change from the historical pattern, especially the sustained volumes

[14-Jul-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
on the coins list we are in the top 30, which is really the more relevant list

[14-Jul-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
top 30 coin!

thats pretty good

[14-Jul-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
that is really quite good, and this is with majority of people thinking KMD is just a zcash clone

[14-Jul-19 07:34 PM] Markus#5464
but we rly have to pass doge, cant let a meme coin be higher ranked üòÑ

[14-Jul-19 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
no single day will cause a magical reevaluation in price to where KMD belongs. it will be a long term process similar to the last couple weeks. as the BTC goes up and down, KMD seems to recover and climb the ranks. over time you will see the KMD peak ranking get higher and higher, and its lowest ranking also being higher and higher

[14-Jul-19 07:35 PM] bishop#9773
Expanding the investor base by showing KMD isn't strictly a ZEC clone is one of the things this rebrand is hoping to accomplish. Unfortunately for short-sighted people, this doesn't happen overnight. There won't be investors lined up tomorrow just because it is the rebrand date. It takes time for information to spread and for interested parties to get involved

[14-Jul-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of people also think that i am the only dev for KMD, when i am only doing research type of things nowadays

[14-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Caglio#3337
then what the fuck was whole last year

[14-Jul-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
preparing for the start of the rebrand!

[14-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Caglio#3337
great

[14-Jul-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Maybe it would be cool to actually finish something we started before we invent something new for a while

[14-Jul-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
For example, rebrand

[14-Jul-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
you mean like atomicDEX?

[14-Jul-19 07:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Anything

[14-Jul-19 07:39 PM] Markus#5464
there is alot of things done, Antara for example

[14-Jul-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i should stop doing research and just wait for the products to be finished?

[14-Jul-19 07:39 PM] bishop#9773
One can argue all the progress done so far was to finish things to have something to market

[14-Jul-19 07:39 PM] bishop#9773
or least get them close enough to the finish line where it isn't vapor

[14-Jul-19 07:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Nah you can research as much as you want sir

[14-Jul-19 07:39 PM] Caglio#3337
But lets say antara project becomes stable like komodo wallets

[14-Jul-19 07:40 PM] Caglio#3337
See what I did there *wink wink*

[14-Jul-19 07:40 PM] Caglio#3337
And we start doing new product
