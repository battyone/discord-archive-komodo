It's much better now. That 3 month transaction was early 2018 and the software has been made faster with each update since then.

[20-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Tek#5253
so theres progress atleast,thats good

[20-Jun-19 11:35 PM] Tek#5253
the real question is , will they be in time with their soluition to stay relevant

[20-Jun-19 11:35 PM] Tek#5253
its like waiting for the workable ETH 2.0

[20-Jun-19 11:36 PM] Tek#5253
as long as its not there why bother buying

[20-Jun-19 11:36 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
IOTA foundation says they have figured out all sorts of things but never anything is released. In their defense though, they are making something never done before so it takes time.

[20-Jun-19 11:36 PM] Tek#5253
hm

[20-Jun-19 11:36 PM] Tek#5253
whats the incentive to run a node?

[20-Jun-19 11:37 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Right now? Just to keep the network going.

[20-Jun-19 11:37 PM] Tek#5253
they face similar hurdles like nano, except nano was more fairly distributed

[20-Jun-19 11:39 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
IOTA is made where the pow for every transaction is done by the person sending the coin. That is why you get zero fees for sending since you are doing the pow. Running a node is to help propagate the tx to the tangle.

[20-Jun-19 11:42 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Their biggest hurdle is the coordinator which kind of makes IOTA centralize since that one server makes sure the tangle isn't being double spent and such. That is why some times a tx can go in a second or longer. Spam the coordinator and you slow the tangle.

After Kleros, WAVES, Komodo, now IOTA Qubic has also solved the oracle problem HAHAHAHA

>This is how we can implement oracles that deliver external data to the Qubic system. Any source of data can package this data as an effect and ask the Supervisor to send it to an environment. If a qubic entity has joined that environment, it will be triggered to process the effect data. Once the qubic has processed the effect data, its result data can in turn be sent as effect data to an environment, which causes the Supervisor to pass it to entities that have joined that environment for further processing. One such entity could be yet another oracle, which then can function as the data provider for further external processing.

>The processing entities aren‚Äôt necessarily only qubics, either. Effect data can be processed by an oracle by passing it on as external data outside the system. Or a processing entity could be a view that displays the effect data. You can mix and match in a very flexible way.

[20-Jun-19 11:43 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
They are working on decentralizing the coordinator but don't expect that to release until near the end of the year.

[20-Jun-19 11:44 PM] Tek#5253
didn't they shut down the coordinator ? thats why it pumped to 6k sats

[20-Jun-19 11:45 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
They announced the decentralization of the coordinator and that is why it pumped. That and pumpers were looking for any news to profit from.

[20-Jun-19 11:45 PM] Tek#5253

oh shit kmd having some buying pressure üòÑ

[21-Jun-19 12:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
applying the fiat based securities model to crypto is like applying the old laws on horse drawn carriages to cars. The old paradigm is on the way out. All the legal fear mongering and arm twisting in the world cannot stop whats coming.

[21-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Tek#5253
if you understand

[21-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Tek#5253

the good ones

[21-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Tek#5253
yeah the taxable crypto to crypto trade is stupid

[21-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
The winners will be the ones that purchased coins before the kyc kicked in.

[21-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Tek#5253
how is the status on KMD for americans?

[21-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Tek#5253
it had an ico and it gathers rewards

[21-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Tek#5253
so it might be  security

[21-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Tek#5253
right?

[21-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
They, the government, doesn't know I have it so I therefore don't have it.

[21-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Tek#5253
obviously but whats the status on KMD?

[21-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Tek#5253
anyone checked?

[21-Jun-19 01:32 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
none that I've heard

[21-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Tek#5253
bitttrex isn't going to delist kmd

[21-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Tek#5253
so i guess kmd is fine

[21-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Not a security since it's a reward and not dividend or interest.

[21-Jun-19 01:33 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea just worried about the DEX cause doesn't that bypass KYC and stuff

[21-Jun-19 01:33 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
which I'm all for but mainstream isn't so KMD might not rise in value

[21-Jun-19 01:35 AM] yorklab#7270
One of the reasons Komodo no longer has privacy was to align as much as possible with regulation.

[21-Jun-19 01:37 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I guess if they launch this DEX and it's unable to be shut down I can see KMD going up very high in value ... cause fuck regulations

[21-Jun-19 01:39 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
it just feels weird that crypto is conforming to regs , would like to see some dapps making the regs impossible to enforce

"KMD itself is a public only chain, no zaddr. this makes it immune from the upcoming regulations against privacy coins. it started in japan, soon it will spread to other countries"

[21-Jun-19 01:44 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
they will try to shutdown DEX's they want their crypto-crypto taxes lol

Another post from JL

?5. Specific Business Models Involving CVC Transactions that May be
Exempt From the Definition of Money Transmission
5.1. CVC Trading Platforms and Decentralized Exchanges
CVC P2P trading platforms are websites that enable buyers and sellers of CVC to
find each other. Sometimes, trading platforms also facilitate trades as an intermediary. 
Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status
if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services
used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.72 Consistent
with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers
and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of
counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through
an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter
under FinCEN regulations
a fully decentralized atomicDEX fits very nicely into the 5.1 exemption, it appears that we can even make a website that displays info about the state of the DEX and that is ok too"

[21-Jun-19 01:47 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea I would love to see the atomicdex be unstoppable

[21-Jun-19 01:47 AM] yorklab#7270
But I agree, the governments want their taxes so something will have to give. I think the  AtomicDEX will do well before the hammer comes down though.

[21-Jun-19 01:49 AM] yorklab#7270
Also (and someone may correct me on this) I do believe that if there are say 5 other projects using MM2 and the same liquidity pool, then all those DEX fees will eventually get converted to KMD.

[21-Jun-19 01:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
banning atomic dex would be like banning craigslist

bottom for kmd seems to be reached

[21-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
no one is dumping anymore

[21-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
seems

[21-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
15k was the bottom

[21-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
~ 15k

[21-Jun-19 02:07 AM] yorklab#7270
Lets hope Bitcoin takes a breather for a while. A whale can take this back to just under 17K pretty easily and still  have plenty of change left.

[21-Jun-19 02:16 AM] Tek#5253
seems lke btc is gonna moon straight to 12k

[21-Jun-19 02:27 AM] meatspoon#7860
it's raping the moon... somehow, paradoxically, with the moon's consent.

[21-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
The moon can live in bitcoins house for all I care. As long as Komodo, and alts in general, can live in the guest house.

[21-Jun-19 02:29 AM] meatspoon#7860
And there will be Kitchen Tables in both houses

Is the US going to war with Iran good for the bull market?

[21-Jun-19 02:39 AM] Tek#5253
yes

[21-Jun-19 02:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm thinking it's a pre war pump. either they start a war or central bankers lose control.

[21-Jun-19 02:40 AM] Tek#5253
