Betanet will become mainnet

[02-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But betanet comes with a “use at your own risk” label

[02-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Anyhow gatecoin listed it and the exit is in progress apparently

[02-Jul-18 09:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah. Living in a commonwealth is pretty funny since we have both influences

[02-Jul-18 09:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Soccer is acceptable here too

[02-Jul-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Can I just say that as long as no one in "Latin America" speaks, reads, or writes anything that even resembles Latin, it should be called something different? 😖

[02-Jul-18 09:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Spanish is a derivative of latin

[02-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Jazzy#0001
It's derived from the french word latine not latin the language

[02-Jul-18 09:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Like french, portuguese, italian, etc

[02-Jul-18 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Spanish is a derivative of latin"
So is most everything that's not Germanic

[02-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
> english is like 70% latin 
> a german language

[02-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Romance languages

[02-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Descendent from latin

[02-Jul-18 09:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Exactly ^^
