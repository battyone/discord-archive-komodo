list them on barterlly, they should sell if the price is right

[23-Jul-19 08:11 AM] actionslacks#4072

“It’s too much work” = they’re looking to fuck you over

but this is in direct contradiction to "No need for trust", there is need for trust. just trying to be accurate

[23-Jul-19 08:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahh, yes, that

[23-Jul-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
atomic swaps are trustless

So we should send some coins @ binance ?

[23-Jul-19 09:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So we should send some coins @ binance ?`
If you want them to collect the rewards and decide who gets them, then sure, go ahead

[23-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Caglio#3337
Oh... interesting point of view

[23-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Alexfrog#1338
oh that is nice

[23-Jul-19 09:38 AM] PHBA2061#2530
they probably discovered that last week from the 30K block 
finally Komodo receives some attentions, but this probably means we will see 5% / 12 more sell pressure each month from the Binance staking ..

[23-Jul-19 09:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
KMD generated by each user = Total KMD staking rewards received by Binance * User KMD holdings ratio.

User KMD holdings ratio = User KMD holdings / Total KMD staked by Binance.```

[23-Jul-19 09:39 AM] Alexfrog#1338
holy shit they are giving out 250000 KMD based on peoples KMD balances on binance

[23-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
on the downside, all the KMD is going to go to binance now

[23-Jul-19 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
until now they gave it to the miners

[23-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it seems that they collected it

[23-Jul-19 09:40 AM] p.#1126
Frontpage boys

[23-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
to the tune of having 250k from staking

[23-Jul-19 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`they probably discovered that last week from the 30K block`
I'm certain they knew before that, but I think that number might have been a "why are we doing that still?" moment

[23-Jul-19 09:45 AM] owerache#0341
sorry repost 😃

[23-Jul-19 09:45 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Alexfrog 1351 in one candle

[23-Jul-19 09:45 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
You awake yet

[23-Jul-19 09:46 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its already almost lost it all

[23-Jul-19 09:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
on the other hand, i will get some free KMD by depositing it to binance and holdign it there until sept 1

[23-Jul-19 09:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
then everyone will get free KMD and dump it, destroying the price 😄

[23-Jul-19 09:48 AM] PHBA2061#2530
on the postive side, KMD price may slowly increase from now until Sep 1st

[23-Jul-19 09:48 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Dude bro y must stop worrying

[23-Jul-19 09:48 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

@Alexfrog When you hold millions, the per-day compounding adds up a lot quicker than you'd think

[23-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I would love to experience that.  Go ahead and send me some of your millions and I will verify 😄

[23-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Caglio#3337

[23-Jul-19 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's 1 addy with 2.4M KMD that has over 120k in yet to be claimed rewards

[23-Jul-19 09:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
omg

[23-Jul-19 09:52 AM] Caglio#3337
I cant believe I didnt fucking delete that stupid address

[23-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
wait, you cant have more than 1 month of rewards right

[23-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
how could it have a 5% reward unclaimed

[23-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Grisu#3373
it only stops accuring after 1month

[23-Jul-19 09:53 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it stops accrueing

[23-Jul-19 09:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
right

[23-Jul-19 09:54 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 so kmd will have the rewards + staking on binance or how must I understand this

[23-Jul-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`wait, you cant have more than 1 month of rewards right`
for "new" utxos, yes
for utxos that existed before the new rule, they can still get max of 1 year
iirc

[23-Jul-19 09:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ah

[23-Jul-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrtzmp3 their "staking" is "rewards"

[23-Jul-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD doesn't have PoS

[23-Jul-19 09:55 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Well thx so they will give the rewards from now on

[23-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[23-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Caglio#3337
which is good

[23-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Caglio#3337
due to shitty kmd uber tech wallets

[23-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Alexfrog#1338
previously everyone was incentivised to withdraw from exchanges and hold KMD yourself, now you can hodl on binance

[23-Jul-19 09:55 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
,,shitty kmd wallets ,,
