The most important thing in crypto

[02-Jun-19 08:26 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Is to press that buy button

[02-Jun-19 08:27 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
It will still be worth more than fiat

[02-Jun-19 08:27 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912

[02-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Tek#5253
> my sides

[02-Jun-19 08:31 AM] Tek#5253
> implying they wont be RUINED when kmd hits the fair value of 100k sats

[02-Jun-19 08:43 AM] Tek#5253
im pretty confident that KMD growth will outperform BTC growth

[02-Jun-19 08:43 AM] Tek#5253
it just has to

[02-Jun-19 08:43 AM] Tek#5253
if it doesn't this world is not just a little tarded but completely tarded

[02-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
I guess a lot of people have the same experience

[02-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
open source is the future of profitable tech companies

[02-Jun-19 08:45 AM] Tek#5253
being a windows company is not going to be an advantage anymore or already isn't depending on the skillsets of your labour force

[02-Jun-19 09:08 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I guess we are up 20% and out of the top 50 now too 49

[02-Jun-19 09:08 AM] Buddz1993#5380

Getting there slowly but surely

[02-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Tek#5253

[02-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Tek#5253
last time they did a round of marketing it went from 17k to 30k

[02-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Tek#5253

[02-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Tek#5253

[02-Jun-19 09:19 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Uhm

[02-Jun-19 09:19 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Guys?

[02-Jun-19 09:20 AM] Oszy#5734
is there an exchange where KMD needs less than 120 conf?

[02-Jun-19 09:20 AM] Bittersweet#9376
What did you do this time?

[02-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Acura#2748
@Oszy i think Tradeogre, Graviex and Digitalprice

[02-Jun-19 09:23 AM] Oszy#5734
Ogre doesn't have kmd, graviex kmd price volume is a joke, and wanted to move from DP, so none of these üòÑ

[02-Jun-19 09:23 AM] Oszy#5734
Just curious why they all need 120 conf for a dPoW coin

[02-Jun-19 09:23 AM] SHossain#0007
bittrex needs only 30 confs and they use dPoW Confirmations

[02-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Oszy#5734
thanks mate

[02-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Acura#2748
ah my bad, correct Oszy
