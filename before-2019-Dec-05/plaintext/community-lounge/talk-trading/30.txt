Just tired of the inevitable damage the Republicans will do if they get another conservative member on the supreme court which they most likely will

I dislike having to be actively disappointed in my homeland instead of just passively unenthused about its failings

[27-Jun-18 07:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Like not decimating the 2nd amendment and cucking the citizens

[27-Jun-18 07:57 PM] Jazzy#0001
Like reversing Row vs Wade

It was lose-lose, but I'm not convinced this was the less of two evils

[27-Jun-18 07:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
Esp. given the future of the SC as a result

[27-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Jazzy#0001
Which is going to be more impactful than anything either would have achieved as president

[27-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A leftist ravaging the makeup of the USSC would have sunk the US forever

[27-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
USSC picks were why I voted for trump

Dems will still be able to murder their progeny while still in the womb

[27-Jun-18 08:02 PM] Jazzy#0001
Who knows, maybe they'll surprise me and actually defends fundamental rights like privacy instead

[27-Jun-18 08:02 PM] Jazzy#0001

"Dems will still be able to murder their progeny while still in the womb"
So, one can assume that you're for a full draw down of the military and the outlawing of the death penalty?

[27-Jun-18 08:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nope

[27-Jun-18 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[27-Jun-18 08:38 PM] Jazzy#0001
Personally you can count me in to shut down the military and outlaw the death penalty, while allowing people the choice to decide what they do with their own bodies

[27-Jun-18 08:38 PM] Jazzy#0001
No ability to survive outside the womb = not a person with the right to jack shit

Maybe I don't know jl well enough to infer his meaning from the comment, but I think taking a side on the clarification options I put out is extracting more information from what he posted than is actually present

"Powell and Gonzalez would then launder the funds as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Etherium, and Komodo through individuals specializing in money laundering on Darknet marketplaces.  At the time of arrest, law enforcement had already seized approximately $437,000 in cryptocurrencies from Powell."

Nice that it was focused on painkillers and firearms

[27-Jun-18 09:48 PM] Jazzy#0001
Although that doesn't seem as true reading the detailed report at the bottom

‚ÄúPCN under 100 sats is a steal‚Äù

At least the latter did a few X‚Äôs since that time, but yes this is one nasty dump and smells like an exit scam.

Does anyone remember when zcash was announced to be listed on alphabay?

[28-Jun-18 09:11 AM] ch6ris#5240
Right before it was shut down.

[28-Jun-18 09:12 AM] ch6ris#5240
Curious is komodo on any tor darknets?

[28-Jun-18 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If they were, would that be a good thing to advertise on a public discord chat?

I don't see why it would matter to disscuss such a thing.

Zcash devs openly discussed when alphabay announced listing zec.
