2+ people finding the same link and posting it in different places/times doesn't really fall within the same realm as 1 person going from channel to channel and spamming the same thing

depends what is realm, if realm=effect both can be solved by auto-hide

Although letting a bank holding your crypto is kind or stupid and kind of defeats the purpose

It could make it easier for institutional or very wealthy investors to get into the crypto market.

[06-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*A formal offering from an institution like Goldman Sachs would provide a credible backing for crypto funds and could pave the way for more investors to bet on the asset class. Having a custody operation in place could also lead to other ventures, including prime-brokerage services, the people said.*

Lot's of big players are getting in position it seems, also with ICE last week saying they are looking into crypto

most people are less likely to loose their money while keeping in a bank. This is even more with crypto. How many people even aware to have diff passwords for each account? <1% maybe

[06-Aug-18 01:49 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so crypto kept in a bank will be bank service in the future same as fiat now

[06-Aug-18 01:49 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
bank is insured if they loose it, you are not

[06-Aug-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`most people are less likely to loose their money while keeping in a bank.`
Fun fact: You have no money in any bank. You make a deposit, the money becomes theirs, and then you have a balance on a ledger.

[06-Aug-18 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Fun fact part 2: The bank gets to take the amount that you deposited and use that as a means to lend 90x vapor to others.

Fun fact 3: well in some way money are never yours - they belong to gov/country who printed them - they make it legit, they can ban it also, inflation can make it worthless as in Zimbabwe and in the end it's just a paper üòÉ

*compared to 8k USD last week*

[06-Aug-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and compared to $460 27 months ago?

[06-Aug-18 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yeah, 10.6% compounded monthly sure does suck üôÑ

[06-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not everyone was able to buy at 460 offcourse üòÉ

[06-Aug-18 03:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because you had to live in the Southern US only in order to buy in April 2016? ü§î

[06-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No because I was a poor startup guy with not enough money to spare on something as frivolous as internet money

[06-Aug-18 03:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bought the bulk around 3000 which still isnt bad I guess but still üòÉ

I think we all liked it better the one day btc was 20k üôà

[06-Aug-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if your broke ass didn't have $460 in 2016, then investing in something as unsure and as volatile as BTC is *probably*  not a good choice for you ....

crypto is my hedge against the collapse of the system as we know it

[06-Aug-18 03:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It is a smart decision to invest anywhere from 5-30% of your liquid assets that you don't necassarily need short term in it

[06-Aug-18 03:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How much you do invest is upto the person him/herself to decide

[06-Aug-18 03:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
him/herself is not PC nowadays I guess?

[06-Aug-18 03:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362

does anyone here believe we will ever see ECNs for crypto?

[06-Aug-18 05:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
like in FOREX

[06-Aug-18 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`ECN can best be described as a bridge linking smaller market participants with its liquidity providers through a FOREX ECN Broker.`
so, you want a middleman between you and DEX?

[06-Aug-18 06:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
no, i want liquidity

[06-Aug-18 06:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
send me all of your BTC and I'll trade it for you üôÇ

wha dafuq is with people wanting to take crypto and do the furthest from crypto things with crypto?

I know, let's take the most secure way (to date) to transfer value and piss all over it by adding more people between us and our value

[06-Aug-18 06:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
ECN provides price consolidation

[06-Aug-18 06:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
you'll get it if you look further than a simple definition

[06-Aug-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is about trading currencies in order to facilitate transference of value, not wagering on the future value of commodities_

[06-Aug-18 06:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
ECNs are as important for crypto as LPs are  in our DEX

[06-Aug-18 06:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
once ECNs are in the picture we just need a few of the brokers to become LPs in our DEX

[06-Aug-18 06:12 PM] snowdamn#2414

[06-Aug-18 11:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Last offer put up, selling timelocked wallet with 92,352 verus in it. 

Looking at .08kmd each. Someone who believes long term for verus and thinks price will go up after next halving should grab a steal :abusedsmily:

[06-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know trust is a big factor but I've done otc with similar amounts, escrowed, payment first for parts, given kmd to help buy verus, etc etc with some of the people in here and verus already :P if anything im willing to send over the wallet file first as long as we go through a team member here.

[07-Aug-18 12:02 AM] bishop#9773

[07-Aug-18 01:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
let me calculate that in my head 2000kmd for 100,000 verus

[07-Aug-18 01:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
1000 for 50,000
100 for 5000
10 for 500
1 for 50
.02kmd each

You can't market it anywhere close to market. Lack of liquidity, lack of market and these are coins that arent available..... yet
