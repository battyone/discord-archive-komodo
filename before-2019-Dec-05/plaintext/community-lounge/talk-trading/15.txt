ya, I think I paid like 12 KMD for all of them 😛

[22-Jun-18 02:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136

[22-Jun-18 02:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136

[22-Jun-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
like right after I bought them, satinder was like "why?"

[22-Jun-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
😛

[22-Jun-18 02:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I bought some on coinexchange too cause they were so cheap hah

[22-Jun-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I don't think I ever bought anything on ce, I did dump a ton of CHIPS on there before DEX

[22-Jun-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there's an irony that the Dec bubble brought such prices that a pseudo of 17 cents now seems low for CHIPS and I remember being excited when it 1st hit up to 12 cents on ce

[22-Jun-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

Chips is in a strange place now to me

[22-Jun-18 02:18 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Upbit has more kmd volume than bittrex for a while now

[22-Jun-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If it weren't for the fact that I'm a reformed poker player I would have never started mining CHIPS

[22-Jun-18 02:20 PM] Bittersweet#9376
How far did you take poker?

[22-Jun-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
too far, some would say 😜

[22-Jun-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I lived in Tunica, MS for quite a while

[22-Jun-18 02:22 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Oh wow

[22-Jun-18 02:23 PM] Bittersweet#9376
i did it for ~1 year really seriously, almost quit my job back then for it because I was earning the same amount in a couple of hours

[22-Jun-18 02:23 PM] Bittersweet#9376
but that was online

[22-Jun-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I quit when my marriage could no longer take the hours and the swings (my craps addiction had a lot to do with both)

[22-Jun-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
inside a year, I won enough to buy 4 homes and lost enough to have to sell 3 of them

[22-Jun-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
To her credit, my wife rarely complained aloud, but I knew she couldn't handle much more of living like that

[22-Jun-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
So, now I trade spec coins instead 😛

[22-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Bittersweet#9376
You've not toned it down that much😂

[22-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Bittersweet#9376
All things considered

[22-Jun-18 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
true, but there are limits with trading (unlike being a casino regular, I can't just trade on margin whenever I feel like it)

[22-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <cascrypto> damme is this finaly the panic and chaos with volume to end this murdering Beer? guess not, going back to being poor, was nice being or feeling rich for a year

[22-Jun-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_never left being poor :(_

[22-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <cascrypto> no no your where chips rich, it will come back. all good thinks come to those who wait

oh look bitcoin is dying !

25k sats!

[22-Jun-18 03:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Abandon ship!

[22-Jun-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, dump all of your KMD now so I can buy more 🤓

[22-Jun-18 03:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Funny thing is outside of OGs people are dumping at a loss

[22-Jun-18 03:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who does this?

[22-Jun-18 03:23 PM] Tyrael#0138
the only KMD you will able to buy is dust

[22-Jun-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
>Who does this?
cowards and morons

You're not the "seven figures" douche from bct, are you?

[22-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
People still go to bitcointalk?

[22-Jun-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol yes

[22-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Feels like AOL chatrooms to me now

[22-Jun-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
mainly ck is the only reason I'm still there

[22-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thing of history

[22-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Tyrael#0138
it's me kemet

[22-Jun-18 03:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe I’ll stop in and do some dick waving with muh legacy account

[22-Jun-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
>it's me kemet
Then you're not the one I mean. There's some douche on there that talks all kinds of shit about how bad KMD is, claims he spent "seven figures" buying KMD, and says that the rest of us are all on "dust" level investments

[22-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Tyrael#0138
there was one dude that lost seven figures in NxT and found out that JL777 dumped on him.

[22-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Tyrael#0138
no one would lose anything in KMD, maybe only if he has never traded in his life.

[22-Jun-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can't help but LOL at all of the FUD that comes from those that bought on the bubble and are crying everywhere about how bad KMD is doing.

[22-Jun-18 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"OMG! I bought high and now I have to sell low for a loss!!!"
feken morons

[22-Jun-18 03:35 PM] Tyrael#0138
i think they didn't bought anything.. like in BTCD most of the trolls are from other coins i don't want say names but they have a ugly mascot

[22-Jun-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, there's that too; most of the anti-KMD on bct comes from unSafeCoin fanboys

Nobody shld blame jl777 for price of kmd.. which he has no control of...the entire cypto is in bear market for the past 5 months

[22-Jun-18 03:40 PM] Tyrael#0138
there are people in shitcointalk that say jl777 manipulates the price!

[22-Jun-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
afaik, that rumor was spun from out of context comments about pegging LP prices on DEX that had no prior market

[22-Jun-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no proof that I dumped on anybody, even in NXT as I never did such things

[22-Jun-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
I think my posting a WTB 60BTC worth of KMD was considered manipulation, even though it is a real order and a real buy

[22-Jun-18 03:45 PM] dexor#2730
Oh well again a bear market again jl is blamed for manipulation. This is a typical indicator that market sentiment is enough to start a bully run 😂

[22-Jun-18 03:45 PM] Jazzy#0001
I think your nature are project lead makes it questionable to announce publicly

[22-Jun-18 03:46 PM] Jazzy#0001
The intention to fill the order does make it legitimate, but there's an air of manipulation that's unavoidable in that kind of situation

[22-Jun-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
why am I not allowed to announce that i want to buy something?

[22-Jun-18 03:47 PM] Tyrael#0138
because you got to many fans

[22-Jun-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
my announcement led directly to a 30BTC OTC order that otherwise would not have happened, so dont tell me I cant do what is practical to fill an order

[22-Jun-18 03:47 PM] dexor#2730
This is done by any coin team. And it should normally fuel up the peice

[22-Jun-18 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Yes, it was very wrong of you to spend out of pocket to buy coins like every other coin owner on the planet 😛

[22-Jun-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
I didnt do it to fuel the price, I did it as I needed to buy 60BTC worth and it wasnt filling at all

[22-Jun-18 03:49 PM] dexor#2730
Many teams announce in some time intervals are buying back from the market. Sometimes they declare they will accumulate from a target price in usd fiat

[22-Jun-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so I will continue to post what I will do, and then do it. I dont care what the other projects do in this regard

[22-Jun-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
I have an obligation to send out KMD revshares, to do that I need to convert BTC into KMD. To achieve that I need to announce it as if I dont, nobody would know that there is the liquidity available

[22-Jun-18 03:51 PM] dexor#2730
What i say is, regardless of your aim, any buyer announcement with 60btc do not kill the price. This is not a manipulation, This is how companies buy their stocks back

[22-Jun-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, if someone (or even a whole team) is willing to put up and spend $400k it's their own business; now, tubthumping a dump of $400k of a premine might be a different story

[22-Jun-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
If it kills the price it works out in my favor, but I am just needing to convert BTC into KMD. I announced it. This happens and it is nothing to do about changing the market price

[22-Jun-18 03:53 PM] kh4567#1136
I see nothing wrong with that.. even in dealing with securities...the major share or securities holders can announce their intention to deal in the said securities prior to the actual buy or sale orders ...its called transparency.. moreover the buyer and seller is not the same party or person ...

[22-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Jazzy#0001
Do you not think there's a reasonable perception of potential manipulation to your announcement?

[22-Jun-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not even close to "reasonable"

[22-Jun-18 03:54 PM] kh4567#1136
This is better than charlie lee who announce AFTER he has dump LTC.. 😀

[22-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Jazzy#0001
You need to step outside of any personal relations to the project here and consider this objectively

[22-Jun-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
besides, if you buy 60BTC worth of any coin in an attempt to "manipulate" the price and the price continues to slide, then you failed to manipulate it anyway 😛

[22-Jun-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
buys raise the price

[22-Jun-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont care about the perceptions of people judging me by the standards they user for pump and dump coins. That is not what I do and I simply needed to convert the BTC into KMD, it wasnt happening, so I announced a WTB. If I have to limit the things I do based on what I feared some fringe groups will perceive as negative, I would end up doing nothing at all

[22-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Jazzy#0001
And that's fine. I'm not criticizing what you did, just trying to explain why some people have reacted the way they have

[22-Jun-18 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
no matter what you do, there will be some critics for it

[22-Jun-18 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
> If I have to limit the things I do based on what I feared some fringe groups will perceive as negative, I would end up doing nothing at all
💯

[22-Jun-18 03:58 PM] kh4567#1136
Especially when its a buy back.. it helps ..its a good thing...u never see charlie lee buyback ltc even at current low level..

[22-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Aka be like every other coin

[22-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That’s the formula to success !!!

[22-Jun-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you use the "dont ever say anything that might get criticized" then the only solution is to do nothing at all, say nothing and stop. but probably you cant even announce that you stopped due to the possibilty of offending someone

[22-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
1/tech ain’t cuttin it

[22-Jun-18 03:59 PM] Jazzy#0001
Very much not what I said or implied

[22-Jun-18 03:59 PM] Tyrael#0138
@jl777c get a hot girl that will do the announcement. fixed

[22-Jun-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
All the critics of the WTB 60BTC are from people that assume KMD is just another pump and dump coin. in fact many criticize that we are not a pump and dump coin

[22-Jun-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_thinks @Jazzy spends way too much time reading random social media_

[22-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
