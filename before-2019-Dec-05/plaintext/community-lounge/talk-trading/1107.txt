@Flint i see your dp is a pirate

[03-Sep-19 10:30 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
arrrs creation was quite simple. choosing the right parameters using komodo and bam, pirate was made

[03-Sep-19 10:30 AM] phideas#8309
In practice today you can’t exchange no token without regulatory oversight. The dream of bitcoin and crypto in general was to gain freedom, not losing it. Komodo is building the tools like atomic swaps, dex, pirate... they are definitely top quality crypto tech. 
1. Pirate, best anon tech today which is zk-snarks from zcash done right. 99.9%+ shielded tx, biggest anon set, btc level security. I don’t see stronger privacy anywhere yet, I could be wrong though.
2. Dex (atomic, hyper, chain swap, all built on mm2) allows trustless exchange between any coin from ethereum ecosystem to bitcoin and btc clones. IMO there is no competition with working product on the market yet. Pls correct me if I am wrong. 
--- Update: there is more ---
3. Komodo, freedom for developers, tax free zone for your projects, smart chains are easy to create (antara), can be secured with btc hashrate, own fee policy, leveraging proven komodo tech saving 10s of thousands+ dollars for maintaining and securing their chain.
4. nSPV, latest improvment of electrum tech will allow "lightweight yet secure" wallet clients. 
5. Ecosystem. Being part of the Komodo ecosystem can have huge benefits for new blockchain startup like R&D cost reduction, DEX liquidity, fund raising, using all the new Komodo tech and OS codebase basically for free.

If you support pirate, you should support the platform that made it possible too 😛 Its not all just about "ico hype" "make tokens to sell for profit"

Tokenomics are for tokens, not for coins!
I see a lot of questions about if KMD doesnt charge any KMD for usage of its platform “why should anybody hodl KMD”. Implicit in the…

[03-Sep-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the reason to have DOGE?

[03-Sep-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
or any of the dozens of other top coins?

[03-Sep-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
do they pay dividends? let you do something you couldnt without it?

[03-Sep-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
based on price movement alone, people come up with all sorts of theories to justify the price. all along knowing that the price is determined by mostly external factors.

@Crabby Paddy  how does this all relate to the statement of facts? and what have the pirates to do with it?

[03-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Flint  from my brief skim over, you seem to say that theres no point for a platform and that ICO hype has passed and kmd is useless.
Pirate was made using komodo, and im sure many other coins will also come forth from what komodo makes possible which are not icos, and have a usecase 😛 also pirates value, both in sats and in useage increased due to dpow, which also requires kmd

[03-Sep-19 10:44 AM] Flint#6435
@Crabby Paddy  I did not say that it is useless - you distort the facts😛  I just stated the lack of real use right now! and I spoke exclusively about the token and not about the platform! or do you think the platform can work exclusively on the KMD token? The main thing in the platform is technology and flexibility - and it can work successfully on different tokens! depending on the relevance of demand and other points!

[03-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I mean, dpow is pretty low in cost vs utility, but as we get more projects, or projects needing multiple chains to all be notarized, that would be some buying pressure.

If the dex goes well, using kmd will have highest liquidity, cheaper fees, and also ability to have 0 confirmation trading. If you have BNB valued so highly based off trading fee discounts, imagine what kmd could do as well

[03-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Flint#6435
Komodo platform is unique and very promising! 💪 we are talking about something completely different - about the prospects and competition of the platform token itself - understand

[03-Sep-19 10:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Flint read the tokenomics link from jl777 above. There is no need for utility of the actual platform token to give that token value

[03-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Flint#6435
no no - Im not a connoisseur of BNB, I just noted their superiority not in the technological component but in the ability to finance anything - in their financial strength - and as for technology, the chest of drawers is in the lead

[03-Sep-19 10:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just look at waves for example. They gave out air drops after airdrops trying to pump their coin, then they tried to do buybacks and now they came up with interest or something.

[03-Sep-19 10:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What long term value do you think that token will have trying to lock in their coins?

[03-Sep-19 10:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But they were not always in this position, their tech and non KYC policy made them the way they are today

[03-Sep-19 10:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But eventually their BNB token just like their exchange, if they do not improve will be over taken

[03-Sep-19 10:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Think about a global orderbook, how much stability would that bring to the market and how much utility will it drive to the project that can do that?

[03-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Flint#6435
here is the question of token liquidity right now - what will force someone to buy a token today or conditionally tomorrow? even before Bitcoin testing its historical highs, it can take a very long time! But how will liquidity come? Now the token has a turnover of less than $ 3,000,000 and the dominance of Bitcoin is growing and no announcements of antara and others affect the price except speculation! However, like other projects

[03-Sep-19 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We wont grow until we have real users/utility

[03-Sep-19 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Price is a reflection of market sentiment, right now for all alts that means going down in price

[03-Sep-19 10:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But if we can bring real usage and innovation, regardless of price, over the long run, the price has to grow compared to all the useless projects that have not utility

[03-Sep-19 10:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Even if BTC is at 80%, i am happy to take a big % of the remaining 20%

[03-Sep-19 10:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Currently alts is 70B, i am happy to take 2% of that

[03-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Flint#6435
in the long term, 3-5 years there is still a positive outlook, but we are losing capitalization today! and believe that not a single business or institutional investor will look our way until such dumps occur at a price! they will wait in bitcoin or gold!

[03-Sep-19 10:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Market cap is a illusion. Try dumping 1M and see what the market cap is

[03-Sep-19 10:54 AM] Flint#6435
@hyperDEX  you are absolutely right when you talk about the usefulness of using utilitarian value!

[03-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Caglio#3337
@Crabby Paddy ( : I bet some chicks msg u and tell u that want to eat u, due to this pic you have ( :

[03-Sep-19 10:57 AM] Flint#6435
and trading volumes are also an illusion? Does this mean that in reality the figure may be even less than what we see? since we are talking about illusion? Does this mean that capitalization in reality is 5 times lower? After all, if you take a metric such as an infusion of real dollars in a current like stablecoin, then the picture is even sadder?

The trading volumes are washed on most exchanges and it is being distorted by tether

[03-Sep-19 10:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The picture is sad but lets compare it with 2016, it is not so sad.

[03-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Flint#6435
@Tek  there by chance did not find prophecies at the price between the lines?😄

[03-Sep-19 10:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What do you think will make the price appreciate out of interest?

[03-Sep-19 11:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Flint it will rise on the 3rd day 😛

Not normal for tek though 😂

[03-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Flint#6435
@hyperDEX  the price has already jumped along the notional bottom for a very long time, but with the increasing dominance of bitcoin, we go even lower than historical lows! it pleases only the fact that we have nowhere to fall much lower - and the actual price can be considered as a zone for a bargain for a period up to halving - this is practically a guaranteed win!😏

@Flint never say never we have 6400 sats to go 😛

[03-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Cost dollar average played out well. Got it down from $13-$15 to $3 in the last week

[03-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Caglio#3337
litecoin managed ro halve its price

@Caglio if we get too old  I’m down to liquidate with you and party in your hometown 🙏

[03-Sep-19 11:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Flint considering most coins that were above us in 2017 are no where to be seen, we were doing very well until about a month ago

I wonder where the real bottom below which we will not go even if Bitcoin drops again to $ 3000

[03-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
My goal is 100,000. 5k  interest Komodo sounds liveable to me 😁

[03-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Caglio#3337
i can live with 500$

[03-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Caglio#3337
so 10000 k is oenough

[03-Sep-19 11:09 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239

@Caglio  do you mean 5% of the rewards?) is it especially interesting if the price for 1 chest of drawers touches 10-12% again😄

[03-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Caglio#3337
@Flint sry what?

[03-Sep-19 11:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
When KMD goes to $5 i will pay your rent 😛

@hyperDEX  think right! After all, Bitcoin will again be transferred to altcoins again - but the fall should be a long one! then the altcoin season but for now death😛
