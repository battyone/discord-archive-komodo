Maybe now you know why  sometimes i am so emotional and complain

[22-Jun-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i bought 2 BTC at $400 back in 2013, that was all i had when i started in crypto.

[22-Jun-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont complain about the losses, real or imagined

[22-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Sherdogz#6731
I bought â‚¬900

[22-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Tek#5253
> now I have 10mil kmd

[22-Jun-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i think i must have "lost" over a billion

[22-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Tek#5253
Typical seven james man

[22-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@coingirl87 seems weâ€™ve been in crypto for about the same amount of time, Iâ€™m pretty numb to shit like this

[22-Jun-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if losing means not holding until the ATH and selling precisely then

[22-Jun-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
had 1% of DASH, was mining it when it was Xcoin

[22-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I donâ€™t have an immediate need to cash out anything to fiat so I can comfortably hodl though

[22-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you live and die by crypto, I can understand the emotion

[22-Jun-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
sold very close to its BTC ATH, which is actually higher than its current BTC price, so even though fiat wise it is 10x less or more, BTC wise i guess it was still the right move

[22-Jun-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
in trading, if you make good BTC, that is not some future loss

[22-Jun-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just part of the chaos

[22-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Does @jl777c sell to actual fiat or tether

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] coingirl87#6489
@Hollowman9000  started in november with the ico of nxt

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thatâ€™s an immediate lottery win

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nice job!

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is hard to to better than NXT ico, i missed it by a few weeks

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I started in November 2013 and immediately got shot in the face with mooncoin

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Markus#5464
whats so special about NXT ico?

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@Hollowman9000 a robot has no need for fiat, i am able to get electricity from the air

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Yassin#3685
@jl777c do you remeber my advise for IOTA? ðŸ˜ƒ

[22-Jun-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
NXT ICO had biggest ROI

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] nael55#5863
nxt ico participants had huge return

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464
what %?

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] coingirl87#6489
Nxt was the next big think at 2013

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
1000x+

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] nael55#5863
tens of thousands i think

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] nael55#5863
it was big

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now itâ€™s a corpse

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464

yes

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iota had a similar return

[22-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Yassin#3685
not remember ðŸ˜¦

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
XEM was probably the largest return

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In history

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  Komodo lacks a working platform for secured tokenization of real assets like gold, Fiat oil and S & P500 shares - in order not to depend on Bitcoin and have real value - then potential customers are not afraid to make a step into the project!

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Yassin#3685

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] coingirl87#6489
Missed both icos ...iota and nxt because was poor student

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A token amount of BTC was donated for community participation

[22-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
.0065 btc or something like that

[22-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Yassin#3685
Shimmer will come soon!!

[22-Jun-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
@Flint nothing stops people from using komodo for tokenization

[22-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Yassin#3685
:troll_thuglife:

[22-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nxt was before my time, I didnâ€™t go alts until jan or feb 2014

[22-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So I should correct earlier statement and say BTC/fiat treated me good at the beginning, my first foray into alts I got murdered

[22-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I kept going back and touching the hot stove though

[22-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didnâ€™t learn

[22-Jun-19 03:39 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  nothing interferes with liquidity and working infrastructure as a full price wallet exchange

[22-Jun-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the words i am reading but the meaning is like clouds in the sky

[22-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Flint#6435
Asety collateral to what extent implemented in the project?

[22-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The words will condense and fall and get you all wet

[22-Jun-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the assets they may be but on the blockchain cannot be

[22-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Markus#5464
@Flint using text to speech or google translate? Dont see "now typing" just suddenly appear from nowhere

[22-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Speak your native language and let us google translate it

[22-Jun-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
tokenization must trust the way it must be

[22-Jun-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
one only is different and that is the crypto

[22-Jun-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the trust can be made multiple in the signatures the rest on the blockchain can be

[22-Jun-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810

[22-Jun-19 03:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Strat made some rich mother fuckers too

[22-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Ok yeah that was also before my time i was knee deep in to stock trading...

[22-Jun-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the days of < $ 1million raised ICO seems long gone

[22-Jun-19 03:48 PM] Bittersweet#9376
@Hollowman9000 you?

[22-Jun-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
NXT raised $30,000

[22-Jun-19 03:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Shoebox

[22-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Flint#6435
@Hollowman9000  Yes of course! And 5 more languages Mandarin will tell you a lot? can be something simpler))

[22-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I need to learn Chinese

[22-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iâ€™ll force my kids to, this dog may be too old for new tricks

[22-Jun-19 03:52 PM] Flint#6435
@Hollowman9000 you will have to study in China or Singapore with native speakers!)

[22-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably have to stick with Singapore

[22-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
China and Burgerland wonâ€™t be friendly for much longer

[22-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Flint#6435
@Hollowman9000  I know people who started studying at 25 and by the age of 30 knew Chinese better than Chinese speakers - it depends on immersion in the process and most importantly - practice with native speakers is daily - this is realizable only in courses in China itself - besides, it is very cheap there!

[22-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
True

[22-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I learned more Spanish working side by side with Central Americans in construction than I ever did in high school Spanish classes

@Hollowman9000  ðŸ˜‹ Tramp is not forever

[22-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Left and right here in burgerland are both ready to kick off the electric boogaloo, maybe Iâ€™ll visit then

[22-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Flint#6435
The language itself is easy because of the short, easily remembered syllables! but here writing is a hell for a student - I planted my sight by drawing hieroglyphs))

[22-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Your writing completely baffles me

[22-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That would be the most difficult aspect

[22-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How many different characters are there?

[22-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are they combinations of a basic set whereby you can derive the meaning of them, or are most unique requiring memorization?

[22-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Flint#6435
it is impossible for some to comprehend it - although everything is excellent with colloquial speech! here, visual memory is important - how developed are the brain regions responsible for absurd thinking and visual
