They‚Äôre all similar

[02-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The Italian tech I worked with vehemently disagreed

[02-Jul-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
And what about Spanglish? üòõ

[02-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Italian was Italian

[02-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
no bueno

[02-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And nothing else came close

[02-Jul-18 09:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Spanglish is very specific of pr

[02-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Italian is the best in the world.

[02-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
The greatest language in the world.

[02-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
You can't argue against its superiority

[02-Jul-18 09:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We are the buggest spanglish talking population

[02-Jul-18 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Italian was Italian"
regional dialects aside, if you can understand Spanish or Portuguese, then you can passably understand Italian

[02-Jul-18 09:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For example trash can is zafacon in PR

[02-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I can pick out the derivations

[02-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
French

[02-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Italian

[02-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Spanish

[02-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Similar ancestry

[02-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Aka Romance languages

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its  because americans told us to "safe a can" for trash

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
wat

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Zafacon = safe a can

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Basura

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Save*

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Basura is trash

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yo se

[02-Jul-18 09:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But trashcan is zafacon

[02-Jul-18 09:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Zafac√≥n

[02-Jul-18 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Basura cano

[02-Jul-18 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[02-Jul-18 09:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"Save a can for trash".... puertoricans where like.... zafac√≥n?? Ok

[02-Jul-18 09:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

The regional dialects interest me from time to time among the Spanish guys on our job sites 

One country a phrase means ‚Äútravel well and be safe‚Äù

2500km south it means ‚ÄúI‚Äôll rape your mother‚Äôs corpse‚Äù

That‚Äôs when the fight started

[02-Jul-18 09:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol

[02-Jul-18 09:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It happens

[02-Jul-18 09:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"Puto" in pr is a man that has lots of women. In argentina puto is gay

[02-Jul-18 09:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You can guess how easy it is to start a fight

[02-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Mexico it‚Äôs bitch if I recall correctly

[02-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Madicon or culero would be gay

[02-Jul-18 09:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also "bicho"in pr is dick. In many other countries a "bicho" is an insect

[02-Jul-18 09:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Verga is dick from what I know

[02-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You know Puerto Rican?

‚ÄúI know Spanish‚Äù

Congrats asshole, you know Puerto Rican?

[02-Jul-18 09:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So every time an argentinian woman says "se me paro un bicho en la pierna" i get a grin

[02-Jul-18 09:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúI stopped a bug in my leg‚Äù

[02-Jul-18 09:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs what spanishdict app told me

[02-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No wonder the translation didn‚Äôt work with this old Central American fellow I was with

[02-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Total language gap

[02-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
He spoke 1940‚Äôs 2nd grader mumbly Spanish native to wherever he was from

[02-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> "a bug stud in my leg"

[02-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn‚Äôt agree with SpanishDict translation app

[02-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> but "se me par√≥" can also be translated to "i had an erection"

a random "one hit wonder"

[02-Jul-18 10:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I imagine that was from MTV8 ‚Äúthe ocho‚Äù back in the early 90‚Äôs when it wasn‚Äôt a geographically flavored version of ‚Äúteen mom‚Äù 24/7

[02-Jul-18 10:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I don't think there was but 1 MTV back then, back when there was still M in their TV

[02-Jul-18 10:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

BTC's current pump is on shit volume and the alts that have started off after it are going to come back down to earth soon enough

[03-Jul-18 09:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[03-Jul-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
100x inflated

[03-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Peaked between 6-7 iirc

[03-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Jazzy#0001
Ouch

[03-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Jazzy#0001
It kind of dropped at an awful time too

[03-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
ICO was 30-40 cents with 20% bonus

[03-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[03-Jul-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
