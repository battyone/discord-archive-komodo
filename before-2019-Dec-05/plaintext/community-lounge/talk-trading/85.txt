`the Verus?` can that be found on 'the Facebook' or on 'the Twitter'

[05-Aug-18 04:39 AM] tolken#2655
@Hollowman9000 yea isn‚Äôt much good for holding, but could be ok for short term trading.  You can buy KMD with usd, sell for usd,  that‚Äôs it. No transferring into crypto land. Disappointing but im sure there will be a market for it. Robinhood does this as well apparently.

Not sure if we're allowed to post wallets for sale (delete if not allowed) but if anyone is looking for verus, I got 92352 timelocked wallet.dat. From what Ive been told theres no way to move funds to another until the rewards unlock. 

Trying to trade it for .09kmd each vrsc.  im sure someone can rig up a script to auto send to their personal wallet as soon as they unlock or something like that üòÖ bit of a trust trade but if anyone might be interested at all let me know. 

Need to get my kmd fix :Komodo:

I have placed buy order on #BarterDEX.
Use native wallets for KMD/VRSC for the quick decentralised trades.
