If i didnt get into kmd myself

[27-Jun-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would probably put it off as another shitcoin and not bother doing any research LOL

[27-Jun-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
thats probably the biggest problem with everyone buying coins these days, constant bombardment

[27-Jun-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
of shit

[27-Jun-18 03:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
True

[27-Jun-18 03:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is it ready, does it work?

[27-Jun-18 03:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not yet but our roa.. shut the fuck up

[27-Jun-18 03:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
If it does, must be fake since its not top 3 ðŸ™„

[27-Jun-18 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Is it ready, does it work?"
For 99% of coins/tokens:
No and no

[27-Jun-18 03:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well in Q3 of.. I just told you to shut the fuck up

[27-Jun-18 03:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But ou.. zip it

[27-Jun-18 03:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Y.. youâ€™re gonna miss the rocket ride bruh

"Prebuy our preICO during our presale, so we can preallocate funds to release our prealpha in 2019"

[27-Jun-18 03:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ha

[27-Jun-18 03:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Up your gas spending

[27-Jun-18 03:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Here comes another ershit token

[27-Jun-18 03:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Heat bag is getting heavy

[27-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Their claim to fame was an exchange (tokenized alts and limited withdraw capability) and 1000 tps

[27-Jun-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Komodo has them completely blown the fuck out and outgunned

{Reactions}

[27-Jun-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
All exchanges should be like safe.trade (240 confirms to deposit and withdraws only when staff manually processes them)
:troll:

[27-Jun-18 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
is that a real exchange LOL....

[27-Jun-18 03:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh wow it is

[27-Jun-18 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that depends on your definition of "real" ðŸ™„

[27-Jun-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the next binance

[27-Jun-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
nah, no, no, no:
Beat-co-neeeeeeeeeeeeect!!!

[27-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Next heat pump Iâ€™m out

[27-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Someone pump that shit already

[27-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[27-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
rip LOL

[27-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
how big are your bags from 1 to 10

[27-Jun-18 03:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
35k heat

[27-Jun-18 03:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not shit (now anyway)

[27-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have z9â€™s to buy

[27-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And heat is obsolete

[27-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
The next batch of z9s are august right? Do we have to preorder in advance heaps

[27-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
or can we buy a few weeks beforehand

[27-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
do they usually sell out? Or they just ship out in batches

[27-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
and no supply problem

[27-Jun-18 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there's no telling how their doing it at this point

[27-Jun-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to et some, before realising the shipping date wasso far away, huge risk there.

[27-Jun-18 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_took the risk and plans to be the largest solo miner in the Komodo ecosystem_

[27-Jun-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If we get enough ASICs + the NN's nobody will even bother to attack us again. ðŸ˜„ just like BTC.

[27-Jun-18 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
even though NN's cut "expected" by so much, I firmly believe the tech as a whole is worth the investment

[27-Jun-18 04:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Their system wonâ€™t send me a verification email

[27-Jun-18 04:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Very annoying

[27-Jun-18 04:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Low energy!

[27-Jun-18 04:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bitmain

[27-Jun-18 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iâ€™ll buy 8 of em

[27-Jun-18 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck it

[27-Jun-18 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Basement gonna be hot

[27-Jun-18 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And loud

[27-Jun-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
just don't buy more than 50, I can't liquidate shitcoins enough to buy more than that ðŸ˜›

[27-Jun-18 04:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I could potentially

[27-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But then weâ€™re talking about electrical work

[27-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Need a bigger service

[27-Jun-18 04:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably $1200/mo to power that beast

[27-Jun-18 04:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so many people overlook that, then the get cornfuzzed when they trade what should have been a profit for a loss

[27-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Got a master electrician buddy

[27-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It could be done

[27-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But thatâ€™s not the big cost

[27-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Power company chewing up the neighborhood

[27-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Running new line

[27-Jun-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
do run a 240v if you can

[27-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thatâ€™s standard residential

[27-Jun-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, I mean to the miners

[27-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah, didnâ€™t even look

[27-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Theyâ€™re 240v?

[27-Jun-18 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
240 is always more efficient than 120

[27-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nevermind

[27-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Stupid question on my part

[27-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Need PSUs too

[27-Jun-18 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
most PSUs in the last 10 years do both ðŸ˜›

[27-Jun-18 04:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have 2 from my old miner

[27-Jun-18 04:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably just get a large single

[27-Jun-18 04:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iâ€™ll need an Ethernet switch

[27-Jun-18 04:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Run some cat5/6 whatever the fuck itâ€™s called

[27-Jun-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
switches are cheap

[27-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They fiber compatible?

[27-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or just ethernet

[27-Jun-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
rj45

[27-Jun-18 04:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
By the time all this shit gets here itâ€™ll end up generating $50/mo instead of $3.2k

[27-Jun-18 04:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And the wife will laugh

[27-Jun-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol

[27-Jun-18 04:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And then she wont

[27-Jun-18 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my wife has chilled a bunch about the numbers since I started
the 1st $2k electric bill (when most of it was still on-site) almost gave her a stroke

[27-Jun-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
before mining, our "expensive" bill in the middle of summer was like $145

[27-Jun-18 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ha

[27-Jun-18 04:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
On site

[27-Jun-18 04:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Where do you keep it now

[27-Jun-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
We have a detached garage that we started out in
a few months back, we moved most of it across town into a metal "pole-barn" type building

[27-Jun-18 04:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Think Zec will fork away from equihash?

[27-Jun-18 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
most likely not

[27-Jun-18 04:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Find more efficient way to do thing

[27-Jun-18 04:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Get mad and avoid thing

[27-Jun-18 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ZEC position seems to be more about reality than trying to make Joe Burgerflipper happy with his $35 GPU

[27-Jun-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've yet to see any legit anti-ASIC claims that didn't just boil down to anti-Bitmain hate and FUD

[27-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe Iâ€™ll stick to multiple smaller PSUs

[27-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck that 3000w jazz

[27-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dollar per watt at that level
