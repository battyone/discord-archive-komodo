I just put it, and its there, earning interest

[24-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Earning interest in something that goes down constantly isnt an interest

[24-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Is a plain loss

[24-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Sure, I have more KMD that I had when I initially bought it

[24-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Caglio#3337
But its worth much much less

[24-Jul-19 09:39 PM] Caglio#3337
And I cannot go buy myself and my family food from that kmd, yet, I can do that with money

[24-Jul-19 09:39 PM] Caglio#3337
So no, dont fucking invest in komodo and wait for 5%

[24-Jul-19 09:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Or you might eat a dick on a salad, and not a normal salad, but GMO salad

Your $7000 didn't stay at $7000

[24-Jul-19 09:40 PM] Caglio#3337
Good still I wrote down 2017

[24-Jul-19 09:40 PM] Caglio#3337
7000% = 7300

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Caglio#3337
7000=7300

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Kmd value now

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Rofl rofl

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Sorry, but this is argument you cannot win

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Caglio#3337
If kmd goes up to 10-15$ great

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Caglio#3337
or if it just stays stable at 1$

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Caglio#3337
5% is amazing

[24-Jul-19 09:42 PM] Caglio#3337
But if it continues this lovely downward trend, you wont have a shit... so its a gamble, I rather prefer normal gambling tables

[24-Jul-19 09:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Btw Croatian paycheck is about 600-700$

[24-Jul-19 09:43 PM] Caglio#3337
KMD on 10$ per piece is gonna give me a nice boost to my initial monthly salary

[24-Jul-19 09:44 PM] Caglio#3337
But its not safe 5%, thats the point.... For imaginary 5% I lost 500%

[24-Jul-19 09:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Its a year and half of a work in my country, 18 monthly rents and food

[24-Jul-19 09:45 PM] Caglio#3337
5%... great

[24-Jul-19 09:45 PM] Markus#5464
lets look at this

[24-Jul-19 09:45 PM] Markus#5464
end of this bull cycle, which coin has the most probability to do 100x?

[24-Jul-19 09:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Noone knows that

[24-Jul-19 09:46 PM] Markus#5464
if we look top 50 coins, which one can u compare kmd development with? is anyone even close?

[24-Jul-19 09:46 PM] Caglio#3337
Every single discord group or twitter account will shill his own coin, like I said once more... I believe in KMD and tech, I like @jl777c even I think he is a moron, cos he paid some retards "ideas by nature" to do stuff for them

[24-Jul-19 09:46 PM] Caglio#3337
I would be better marketing guy than those fucks, that cant even make a simple logo

We cannot afford 1000-2000kmds

[24-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Caglio#3337
But he can pay out people that got hacked ?

[24-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Are we serious ?

[24-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Markus#5464
Eth is looking to adopt BCH blockchain to scale....i mean wtf are those devs and teams doing?

[24-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Markus#5464
its like a joke

[24-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Markus dude, I really think you are a smart guy, and I listen to your market observations

[24-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Caglio#3337
You are a trader, and you are good in it

[24-Jul-19 09:48 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not a trader, not crypto one at least... I trade different kind of goods

[24-Jul-19 09:48 PM] Caglio#3337
With this tech and a good boost in the back, good promotional team

[24-Jul-19 09:48 PM] Caglio#3337
We could easily be top 25

[24-Jul-19 09:49 PM] Caglio#3337
We are not, cos we cannot afford this and that, we are here in the tech and everyone will recognize us.... I mean why are people deluded by this... people are morons... believe me, they are fucking sheeps with no brains, most of them

[24-Jul-19 09:49 PM] Markus#5464
If Eth can be top 2 with a dev team not being able to fix their own code, i think it explains enough what kind of projects we are dealing with in this crypto space. I dont see how KMD cannot replace Eth one day

[24-Jul-19 09:49 PM] Caglio#3337
I can easily see how

[24-Jul-19 09:50 PM] Caglio#3337
I first heard of a crypto like back in 2014. I didnt care a little bit, start of 2017, my friends got into it

[24-Jul-19 09:50 PM] Caglio#3337
Buying mining rigs for ethereum, then buying those ASIC things for LTC/BTC, they went in hardcore

[24-Jul-19 09:50 PM] Markus#5464
BSV, a lier and imposter as a creator. 99% of block activity from a weather app

[24-Jul-19 09:50 PM] Markus#5464
:troll_lol:

[24-Jul-19 09:50 PM] Caglio#3337
What s a bsv ?

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Markus#5464
bitcoin sv

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Caglio#3337
I havent heard of that, is that a fork of BCH ?

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Markus#5464
yes

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Yihan wu ?

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Caglio#3337
or smt like that

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, then I heard of it

craig wrights coin

[24-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh

[24-Jul-19 09:52 PM] joe2x4#5987
I think your problem with KMD is you are not rich yet.

[24-Jul-19 09:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Joe, I dont have a problem with kmd

[24-Jul-19 09:52 PM] Caglio#3337
I had a problem with ur observation and an advice you gave to someone

[24-Jul-19 09:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Cos I experienced it on my skin

[24-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not bullshiting people, and honestly, if I was on 0 with my invested money rn, no losses, or lets say 10% losses, I would be out

[24-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Caglio#3337
I honestly dislike the crypto scene

[24-Jul-19 09:53 PM] joe2x4#5987
Please, can you tell us about your marketing experience so we can learn

[24-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Caglio#3337
I could tell you about my marketing experience, but its probably illegal in most of the countries of the world

[24-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Caglio#3337
So I would rather not

[24-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Caglio#3337
This here, is not how is supposed to be done

[24-Jul-19 09:54 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont know how much money it cost, but I assure you, I would do more good than those Ideas by nature did

[24-Jul-19 09:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Noone is aware of kmd, noone gives a dead fuck about it... Dex will be a game changer ? sure

[24-Jul-19 09:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Lets hope so, I personally doubt it

[24-Jul-19 09:55 PM] Caglio#3337
many shitcoins that did nothing, did more than we "with one of the best tech" did

[24-Jul-19 09:56 PM] Markus#5464
ideas by nature helped kmd with redoing visuals like design of the atomicdex, new website wording and visualising to make it easier for ppl to get a taste of what kmd really is

[24-Jul-19 09:56 PM] joe2x4#5987
So KMD needs to do some illegal marketing? This is getting my brain juices flowing.

[24-Jul-19 09:56 PM] Caglio#3337
I never said illegal marketing, you are putting words in my mouth... You just asked me my knowledge with one....

[24-Jul-19 09:57 PM] joe2x4#5987
I just assumed since you had marketing suggestions, they would be based on your marketing experience which apparently includes illegal marketing. My bad.

[24-Jul-19 09:58 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Caglio there are always speed bumps on the road to progress and perhaps some toll booths or cliques, but it is to be expected, no?

[24-Jul-19 09:59 PM] joe2x4#5987
If no one gives a fuck about KMD, then I guess binance is no one

[24-Jul-19 10:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
binance hates kmd obviously, total shitcoin

[24-Jul-19 10:00 PM] Markus#5464
as long as kmd keep this development speed going im not concerned, i know its frustrating to see price plumment but it is what is is, hopefully we can see price surprise all of us and exceed out expectations

[24-Jul-19 10:01 PM] Caglio#3337
@Lumbi i agree with you...

[24-Jul-19 10:01 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont say kmd is shitcoin lol

[24-Jul-19 10:01 PM] Caglio#3337
We started discussion cos @joe2x4 adviced someone

[24-Jul-19 10:01 PM] Caglio#3337
to invest as much money he can, cos kmd gives 5% interest

[24-Jul-19 10:02 PM] Caglio#3337
I just explained how things work, and that 5% interest isnt 5% interest on money, its 5% on kmd, and kmd only lost me money

[24-Jul-19 10:02 PM] Lumbi#8378
@joe2x4 if I recall correctly KMD was listed as US-compliant... but binance is getting fishier by the minute.

[24-Jul-19 10:03 PM] joe2x4#5987
@Lumbi yeah, you got to be careful using a cex. I'd recommend finding a great Dex.

[24-Jul-19 10:04 PM] Caglio#3337
And about those DEXes

[24-Jul-19 10:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Normal timmy

[24-Jul-19 10:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Timmy = term in mtg

[24-Jul-19 10:04 PM] Caglio#3337
will always rather get coins over CEX

[24-Jul-19 10:04 PM] joe2x4#5987

Fuck cryptsy. Fucking Vern.

[24-Jul-19 10:05 PM] Lumbi#8378
binance was fishy when it started... made improvements and now is a target

[24-Jul-19 10:07 PM] Lumbi#8378
... trust "safu" about as far as I could throw 'em üòÑ

[24-Jul-19 10:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
little timmy doesn't give a shit about kyc so he'll advertise his lunch money to all the govt servers. billy big bags doesn't want anyone to know shit about his bags or his life/family could be in danger.

[24-Jul-19 10:10 PM] Caglio#3337
cryptopia

[24-Jul-19 10:10 PM] Caglio#3337
