It’s simply not true

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 liquid is the future from btc maximalists point of view 😂

I'm still waiting for #Liquid specs, so that we can integrate this "sidechain" into @BarterDEX since they say absolutely this isn't a private blockchain between the federates. Not at all. #blockchain #KMD #BTC #DEX

[16-Oct-18 11:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what we can conclude for now is that $1 per KMD is a fair low price for the market

[16-Oct-18 11:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we have hovered around it for some months now

[16-Oct-18 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@siu - Chainmakers I specifically was referring to someone that thought I might have 350 BTC to throw up a wall

[16-Oct-18 11:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If we start a bull run from here we could definitively say that KMD is never going to be worth less than $1 again.

[16-Oct-18 11:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or less than 15k sats.

[16-Oct-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"never" is a pretty strong word

[16-Oct-18 11:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, strong, but still not confirmed

[16-Oct-18 11:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if we make a new ATH from here i can see this becoming a long term bottom, something like when btc went to $1.98 after going to $30

[16-Oct-18 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
something i can say might never be visited again

[16-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the good ol days

[16-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
before my time

[16-Oct-18 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah

[16-Oct-18 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i remember seeing that bottom and not buying

[16-Oct-18 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then bought at around $5

[16-Oct-18 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and sell them at $7 thinking i made the best investment ever 😂

[16-Oct-18 11:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i wish i could have bought $5k worth back then and not need return from them

[16-Oct-18 11:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would have been a millionaire by now

[16-Oct-18 11:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
LOL at "classic crypto pump"

[16-Oct-18 11:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if this was a pump we would have been mooning already... moron

[16-Oct-18 11:50 AM] snowdamn#2414
can't wait for the fireworks

[16-Oct-18 12:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
a pump would be a marketbuy for 50BTC and sellof after

[16-Oct-18 12:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
selloff*

[16-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
in the hopes of recovering 60btc

[16-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so what is this called?

[16-Oct-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🐳  buying ?

[16-Oct-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Does remind me a bit of that 10,000 BTC buy wall on BCH last year on bittrexx though 😂

I remember the pump in december beginning like this as well

[16-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
buywalls moving up and up

[16-Oct-18 12:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c its called accumulation

[16-Oct-18 12:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is a lot of accumulation going on

[16-Oct-18 12:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Im off to eat some stale bread. Someone ping me if the whale goes crazy and takes us to 30k

[16-Oct-18 12:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
crap he moved to 17.5k

[16-Oct-18 12:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this whale doesnt seem to be wanting a pump and dump

[16-Oct-18 12:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
with the kind of volume he/she is buying he would have easily pumped us to above 30k sats long ago

[16-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Andersen#8337
Looks like  350 btc whale is  very rich , but  not profi in trading and using exchanges \crypto

[16-Oct-18 12:28 PM] Andersen#8337
newbie whale

[16-Oct-18 12:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
moved back to 17.5k now

[16-Oct-18 12:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
just watched a red candle bleed as soon as he moved it back lol

[16-Oct-18 12:31 PM] BlockTech#6895
Where is the Wall ? XD

[16-Oct-18 12:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Binance 17.5k

[16-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Good

[16-Oct-18 12:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Move to 15 please

[16-Oct-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`newbie whale`
@Andersen Conversly, it's possible that they are "old money" and "Who cares about $350 I spent 4 years ago, my Lambo is bought and paid for already"

[16-Oct-18 12:43 PM] dokrates#8987
I think moved the wall back to push people to sell and could move again to 18k and 19k to scratch more at low price

[16-Oct-18 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Some "old money" BTC holders look at BTC like online poker players look at poker chips: "It's not real money unless I need to cash it out"

[16-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Bittersweet#9376
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 sounds healthy

[16-Oct-18 12:46 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Think @dokrates is right on the money there. Move back down sells fill back in 18 to 19 he swoops up again to 19.

[16-Oct-18 12:47 PM] dokrates#8987
thats what i will do 😋

[16-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The 2017 alt coin pump started with old BTCs that were purchased for far lower than the price they were at the time.

[16-Oct-18 12:48 PM] dokrates#8987
i won't move over 20k until i filled as much coins i want, so i'll be moving up and down

[16-Oct-18 12:48 PM] dokrates#8987
@Kitchen Table  what month started altcoin pump in 2017?

[16-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
mfw sold some at 1930

[16-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
buying it back now

[16-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
thank you whale bro

[16-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I would say around March. It was about the time I noticed alts going higher.

[16-Oct-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_does the fanboy thing and says "I can see 50k sats right around the corner"_

A couple 10k kmd sellwalls appeared

[16-Oct-18 01:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wonder if that is the whale also to lock in the price at which he wants to buy?

[16-Oct-18 01:26 PM] dokrates#8987
i saw 40k sellwall

[16-Oct-18 01:26 PM] dokrates#8987
definitely its the owner of the 1.8M wall

[16-Oct-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Or PIRATE dumpers

[16-Oct-18 01:27 PM] dokrates#8987
why they dump now, they could dump with the wall at 19k

[16-Oct-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
They are dumping PIRATE @ 50%, what makes you think they saw the 19k? :trollface:

KMD dropped from $1.2 to $1 and they *lowered* the ARRR/KMD prices 🤦🏼

[16-Oct-18 01:38 PM] blubbi#0643
genius around

[16-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Japesmith#0609
@dokrates I'd agree March too. I kept taking profits along the way. Would have made a fortune if I'd just left everything where it was.

[16-Oct-18 01:48 PM] dokrates#8987
yep
