Someone on arfcom posted it up, some security notice he had from his company

[01-May-19 09:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Said it had his email/pass on it

Yeah just ran through that

[01-May-19 09:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
My email is listed as ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù, they consider having my email address as ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù

[01-May-19 09:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Won‚Äôt have my password though

@Hollowman9000#3344 it seems that if your email has been leaked in a breach it's on the list. But that doesn't mean the hackers have an updated password

that's why having 2FA is a must üòÉ

NXT lambo guy says 2022 is the next parabolic run

[02-May-19 11:56 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So we have some time @siu - Chainmakers

[02-May-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
didnt he buy a bunch of CLAMS ?

[02-May-19 11:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Parabollic rises have not happened on par years, i would say more like 2021

[02-May-19 11:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its 2011, 2013,2017...

[02-May-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Still at 35M market cap @jl777c , 34.9M too high

[02-May-19 12:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Following that, 2025 will be the next run @siu - Chainmakers

Unless 2019 will be the next one

[02-May-19 12:13 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That NXT lambo guy also sold a large holding of his NXT at the bottom to buy into CLAMS. I give little value on what he thinks will happen. Besides, did he fix that knocking noise his lambo was making in that one video?

[02-May-19 01:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Cryptoon too soon

[02-May-19 01:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Eth doesnt seem to barely get any attention at all during this days, it keep decreassing in price meanwhile btc and others atleast gain abit or stay equal

[02-May-19 01:39 PM] Markus#5464
Eth just goes down and down üòÑ

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just like ZEC

[02-May-19 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[02-May-19 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
ETH is obsolete

[02-May-19 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They don‚Äôt scale

[02-May-19 01:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
FOMO time is over

[02-May-19 01:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
xtz will be the new eth during the next bullrun

[02-May-19 02:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Kmd should be the next eth

[02-May-19 02:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Pittsburgh native African cab driver I bullshitted with on my way to the strip club (buddies bachelor party) told me he once had some bimbo ask him who the president of Africa was

Tbh, I think that if you ask 100 people anywhere where madagascar is situated, over 50% will not know the correct area

30% might correctly guess somewhere in Africa, but not point to the island on the right to it

[02-May-19 02:31 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Sorry. #neverforget

Well if you ask 100 people 10 of them should be somewhat intelligent just by how distribution of IQ points work

[02-May-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although a high IQ isnt a guarantee for knowledge

[02-May-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But still

Let‚Äôs not lie to ourselves

[02-May-19 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
about talking animals

[02-May-19 02:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But also a lot of nice fauna/flora in madagascar, thought it was one of the most diverse area's in the world still

[02-May-19 02:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But people dont care about animals/plants so whatever :p

Like a sharpie line, not pencil

[02-May-19 02:51 PM] Malti#3948
I don't consider myself smart, nor stupid. But if you'd ask me off the bat how many oceans there are, I wouldn't know either tbh. It's just not knowledge that stuck from high school

[02-May-19 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the answer is 5 malti

[02-May-19 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so now you know

[02-May-19 02:51 PM] Malti#3948
after you've googled it

[02-May-19 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
nah

[02-May-19 02:52 PM] Malti#3948
name them

[02-May-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
atlantic, pacific, indian, arctic and southern

[02-May-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
artic?

[02-May-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
arctic?

[02-May-19 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
arctic is around the north pole

[02-May-19 02:53 PM] Malti#3948
i just want to say that general knowledge =/= intelligence

[02-May-19 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
southern is around antarctica

[02-May-19 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah but higher possibilities that a smarter person knows something

[02-May-19 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as in general intelligent people are more interested in a variety of stuff or have read more etc

[02-May-19 02:55 PM] Malti#3948
that is true, because you get confronted with that kind of stuff more often i'd say

[02-May-19 02:55 PM] Malti#3948
when wathcing news channels

[02-May-19 02:56 PM] Malti#3948
but summing up the oceans/whatever is something you learned in primary/secondary school and then never again
