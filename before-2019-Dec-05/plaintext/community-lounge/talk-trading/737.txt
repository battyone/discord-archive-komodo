40 million

[05-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Tek#5253
or 70 million

[05-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Tek#5253
in any case it was way more than the dash instamine

[05-Jun-19 12:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
It's hard to quantify how much crypto is simply gone but I think it's way more than most realize

[05-Jun-19 12:52 AM] 차미숙#8912
Yeah I think so too

[05-Jun-19 12:52 AM] 차미숙#8912
Especially bitcoin

[05-Jun-19 12:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
Humans are hopelessly clumsy and forgetful

[05-Jun-19 12:52 AM] Tek#5253
whats the biggest amount of crypto you ever lost due error or hackings ?

[05-Jun-19 12:52 AM] Tek#5253
or whateveer

[05-Jun-19 12:52 AM] Tek#5253
whats the biggest amount you lost

[05-Jun-19 12:53 AM] Tek#5253
for me its 10 nano (lmao) didn't backup wallet seed, my phone updated and my wallets were all gone

[05-Jun-19 12:53 AM] Tek#5253
so like 20 bux

[05-Jun-19 12:53 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
When MGW and DEX was being traded on NXT I mention to people that 10 MGW equals 1 DEX. People were still paying up 200 NXT for DEX and MGW was 100 NXT for 10 MGW. Might have to read that sentence a few times.

[05-Jun-19 12:54 AM] 차미숙#8912
Isn't it funny that the very act of forgetfulness reduces coin supply and brings price up

[05-Jun-19 12:54 AM] 차미숙#8912
Satoshi is such a genius

[05-Jun-19 12:54 AM] 차미숙#8912
There was this one dude who had like a lot of ripple

[05-Jun-19 12:55 AM] 차미숙#8912
And he made so much money during last hype

[05-Jun-19 12:55 AM] 차미숙#8912
Like 500Mil

[05-Jun-19 12:55 AM] 차미숙#8912
That he did so much cocaine and died of DO

[05-Jun-19 12:55 AM] 차미숙#8912
And that coin is lost forever

[05-Jun-19 12:55 AM] Tek#5253

It's ripple. They'll just print more.

[05-Jun-19 12:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
The NXT AE was my first realization of what the crypto revolution really meant. I can't believe it was only 4 yrs ago

[05-Jun-19 12:56 AM] 차미숙#8912
Well not bitcoin lol

[05-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Tek#5253
i was doing some research on ripple

[05-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Tek#5253
and then some dude went looking in the code

[05-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Tek#5253
and apparently the max supply / total supply  is just a parameter they set

[05-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Tek#5253
so if ripple decides they want to print an extra 100 billion in 10 years,

[05-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Tek#5253
they can

[05-Jun-19 12:57 AM] Tek#5253
easily

[05-Jun-19 12:57 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
NXT strongest feature was the asset exchange yet the devs place all their work on making forks.

[05-Jun-19 12:57 AM] 차미숙#8912
What was the nxt roi for ICO?

[05-Jun-19 12:57 AM] richardt#2807
NXT devs screwed up something with huge potential

[05-Jun-19 12:57 AM] 차미숙#8912
Was it like 4000x?

[05-Jun-19 12:58 AM] richardt#2807
If i remember correctly, if you bought NXT during ICO, it was about a 50X gain

[05-Jun-19 12:58 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Something like ramen to lambos.

[05-Jun-19 12:58 AM] 차미숙#8912
Lol

Man I miss those ICO days

[05-Jun-19 12:59 AM] 차미숙#8912
Making money has never been easier

[05-Jun-19 12:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
It was intoxication

[05-Jun-19 12:59 AM] richardt#2807
I miss days when people held until at least a 10x gain.  Nowadays a 10% gain is considered a good trade 😄

[05-Jun-19 12:59 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Except for the Waves ICO. Would have lost your ass if you didn't wait a few months after ICO.

[05-Jun-19 01:00 AM] 차미숙#8912
I went into LISK and then i saw waves

[05-Jun-19 01:00 AM] 차미숙#8912
And didn't do that cuz the CEO was russian

[05-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I did the same. Made good money from the Lisk ICO. Put some into Waves.

[05-Jun-19 01:01 AM] 차미숙#8912
I mined some LISK too and gtfod

[05-Jun-19 01:01 AM] 차미숙#8912
Loool

[05-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Tek#5253
fair value would be $1.65

[05-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Tek#5253
few months ago it was 4x undervalued

[05-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Lisk hit polo and I was able to get mine to the exchange before the doss attack on the webwallets. Good money in that first hour.

[05-Jun-19 01:02 AM] 차미숙#8912

BCH fair value is at $1300

[05-Jun-19 01:03 AM] 차미숙#8912
Damn

[05-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Tek#5253
lmao the BTC fair value is at $7000

[05-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Tek#5253
below what it is now

[05-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Tek#5253
does anyon know anything about AELF?

[05-Jun-19 01:06 AM] 차미숙#8912
Sounds like a shitcoin

[05-Jun-19 01:06 AM] Tek#5253
agreed

[05-Jun-19 01:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
I remember one guy freaking out in the polo trollbox about how he just paid off his tuition on an eth trade.  Heady times

[05-Jun-19 01:06 AM] 차미숙#8912
I miss the banhammer

[05-Jun-19 01:07 AM] 차미숙#8912
People trolling all day lol

[05-Jun-19 01:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
that was fun

[05-Jun-19 01:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`lmao the BTC fair value is at $7000`
imo, $6800; so, they aren't far off

[05-Jun-19 01:12 AM] Tek#5253
didn't expect it to be lower now than the actual value

[05-Jun-19 01:12 AM] Tek#5253
when btc was $3700 the fair value was like $8k

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Tek#5253
I guess that, bc the fees are so high now, less people use it

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Tek#5253
hence it gets a lower valuation now

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Tek#5253
then back then

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] 차미숙#8912
That is a bad way to value something

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Tek#5253
network usage is a good way to measure value

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC market value is generally based on unicorns and rainbows (or the lack thereof in a bear)

[05-Jun-19 01:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
It's the most liquid and resistant

[05-Jun-19 01:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
Good way to dump your cash

[05-Jun-19 01:14 AM] Tek#5253
but only because of the massive leveraged gambles that sit on it

[05-Jun-19 01:15 AM] Tek#5253
what do you guys think about LINK?

[05-Jun-19 01:15 AM] Tek#5253
I personally think its a scam, or atleast a shitty investment

[05-Jun-19 01:15 AM] Tek#5253
but almost everyone I meet seems to believe in chainlink

[05-Jun-19 01:16 AM] Tek#5253
reasons I think its a bad investment: printed out of thin air + sergey holds 65% or 65 million link

[05-Jun-19 01:16 AM] Tek#5253
reasons I think its a scam : 2 man dev team is gonna solve the oracle problem

[05-Jun-19 01:16 AM] Tek#5253
we are 2 years further now, and they still haven nothign

[05-Jun-19 01:17 AM] 차미숙#8912
A thing I learned from experience is if your shitcoin's CEO is russian or Chinese better gtfo

[05-Jun-19 01:17 AM] Tek#5253
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 whwhat do you think bout chainlink

[05-Jun-19 02:05 AM] Alecandro#1179

literally nothing good is allowed to happen

KMD breaks out, this happens 3 hours later

[05-Jun-19 02:11 AM] Sdunbar#5064
coincided almost perfectly with big news announcement lol

[05-Jun-19 02:11 AM] Sdunbar#5064
almost comical but actually very sad and unforunate

[05-Jun-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
the timing is suspect, but also I like to be paranoid

[05-Jun-19 02:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
well it's not boring.
