first of all I dont watch a lot of porn

[24-Sep-19 04:52 PM] Caglio#3337
When I do, I do watch midget porn

[24-Sep-19 04:52 PM] Caglio#3337
You will ask why, like most of the people usually do

[24-Sep-19 04:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Well the truth is, I am not attracted to little hobbits or dwarves

[24-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337
But I like feeling superior

[24-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean I have rather small weiner

[24-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337
But when you look at their small torsoes, my weiner looks rather huge

[24-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337
Even tho, sometimes a dwarf with a big schlong comes around and ruins my day

[24-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337
I feel rather depressed then

[24-Sep-19 04:54 PM] Caglio#3337
I also like cucumbers tho

[24-Sep-19 04:54 PM] Caglio#3337
I remember one time when I paid money to Vietnamese sex worker

[24-Sep-19 04:54 PM] Caglio#3337
To have sex with a piece of corn

[24-Sep-19 04:54 PM] Caglio#3337
I think it costed me about 2 euros ( 800 K64 )

[24-Sep-19 04:55 PM] Caglio#3337
I loved every part, specially got turned on in the end, when she farted out pieces of corn out of her bum

[24-Sep-19 04:55 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh sorry bro (

[24-Sep-19 04:55 PM] Caglio#3337
I think I would be a good mod for this channel , yes, I will start a campaign and get all of you as my voters !

[24-Sep-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Btw when you people started talk about cum, I think I should get myself checked

[24-Sep-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Cos my seed is been rather yellow last few months, and fluidly like a banana yogurth

[24-Sep-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont think that is a natural look

[24-Sep-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
I got to get clean before I go to Amsterdam, I dont want to give those nice ladies of the night an STD

[24-Sep-19 04:59 PM] Caglio#3337
I remember when I was like you, so pure and goodhearted

[24-Sep-19 04:59 PM] Caglio#3337
It was when I got out of the safety of my mothers womb

[24-Sep-19 05:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Good old times

[24-Sep-19 05:17 PM] mrlynch#5735

[24-Sep-19 05:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
New community guidelines for the discord channels.... @Tek I consider this your fault.

[24-Sep-19 05:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what do the moving averages look like though

[24-Sep-19 05:32 PM] Audo#5667
guys we just announced the community guidelines and 30 min after it here you guys talk about midget porn. Not cool.

We don't have the resources yet to enforce guidelines. I only ask that you guys will start to talk about traidng in #talk-trading 

I want this channel to be a bit more cleaner every day.

[24-Sep-19 05:33 PM] Audo#5667
you can PM them, and if they really like it then they won't block you

[24-Sep-19 05:34 PM] Audo#5667
just not on public channels please, most people don't want to read about it

[24-Sep-19 05:34 PM] Audo#5667
yep, pretty sure

It was pretty funny when jl himself stopped by to say wtf to @Tek

[24-Sep-19 05:36 PM] JimD#9272
Trader is a strong word for what I actually do

[24-Sep-19 05:37 PM] groundhog#0062
y do we need trading chat in the 1st place? someone with pro account could open a kmdchat on tv no? imo would be more straight forward to refer ppl from here there through pinned message.

[24-Sep-19 05:38 PM] Caglio#3337
@Audo I think people like to read about stuff like this, therefore we could get a new room

[24-Sep-19 05:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Not #talk off topic, because its not interesting name

[24-Sep-19 05:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Lets call it somewhat differently

[24-Sep-19 05:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
#not-safe-space

[24-Sep-19 05:39 PM] Audo#5667
maybe we rename the channel, how about

#talk-casual

[24-Sep-19 05:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
not sure if midget pron is casual though

[24-Sep-19 05:39 PM] Audo#5667
but still no midget porn topics pls üòÑ

[24-Sep-19 05:39 PM] xeonrider#3120
I'd prefer it not being a channel for that stuff at all

[24-Sep-19 05:40 PM] xeonrider#3120
why not just get a group dm

[24-Sep-19 05:40 PM] Audo#5667
yes, such topics won't be allowed on any channel

[24-Sep-19 05:41 PM] xeonrider#3120
also, trading should have a purpose I mean arent there like a lot of komodo projects or interesting projects etc

[24-Sep-19 05:41 PM] Audo#5667
no, trading will stay trading. I renamed off-topic to talk-casual

[24-Sep-19 05:41 PM] xeonrider#3120
but midgets doxxing and the semen stuff, come on

[24-Sep-19 05:42 PM] xeonrider#3120
its like a minecraft chat server for frustrated teenagers

[24-Sep-19 05:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Tek not cool

[24-Sep-19 05:43 PM] xeonrider#3120
@Tek you might think I am someone who can take a joke. I can't. So, I am doing the copy id and submit that message to discord.

[24-Sep-19 05:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
#talk-other-topics

[24-Sep-19 05:45 PM] Caglio#3337
We need to have topics where we talk about sex

[24-Sep-19 05:45 PM] Caglio#3337
sex sells

[24-Sep-19 06:01 PM] jorian#4555
Tek has his own discord for that kind of talk :abusedsmily:

[24-Sep-19 06:02 PM] jorian#4555
imagine a business is looking into building a blockchain, finds Komodo the open source blockchain platform, starts browsing in its discord and it finds all kind of random stuff in a not so random channel like trading

it also discourage actual trading talking

[24-Sep-19 06:15 PM] Caglio#3337
It discourage who ? üòÑ

[24-Sep-19 06:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
... people who actually want trading-talk in talk-trading ?

[24-Sep-19 06:24 PM] Caglio#3337
Poor guys, I didnt realize how much trauma this chat does to them

[24-Sep-19 06:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I really thought those ppl have thicker skin, after all the trades they did, and the volatility of crypto

[24-Sep-19 06:26 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean whole idea of changing real life usage cash, to buy something that loses its value should made them a bit stronger

[24-Sep-19 06:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Caglio there are different trade strategies, and a plethora of varieties of the human-type

[24-Sep-19 06:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
all that is happening with the new guidelines is to ensure a pleasant space for all (most)

[24-Sep-19 06:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
what some find pleasant others find disgusting and vice-versa

[24-Sep-19 06:30 PM] Caglio#3337
I know, I still think people should be less offended on the internet, its not that safe space, however I understand what @Audo wanted to say, therefore I wont contribute to this chat anymore, to keep it safer, and warmer environment, for the less brave crypto ppl

[24-Sep-19 06:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
i also think that, however we can not change human nature and a minimum of respect should be extended to all
