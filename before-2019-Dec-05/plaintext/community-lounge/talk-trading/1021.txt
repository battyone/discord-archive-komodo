so much salt in here., you can feel the toxicity in the air. ppl bought more than they dared to lose. The greed is real. blaming others is stupid. you made the decision to buy, take responsibility. Sell now if you can't handle it, limit your loss, stay in btc

at this pace, we will soon leave for $ 0.5((

[06-Aug-19 09:31 AM] Flint#6435
it crashes no matter what - neither the announcement of Antara nor DEX, nothing saves the price! who sells it - manipulators who want to shake "weak hands" or miners, or just panic sales.ü§î

[06-Aug-19 09:31 AM] Thievery#4576
I'm guessing this is being caused by globally stocks are crashing and outside investors are entering into BTC because that's the most well known and safest crypto to go for.   Everything is crashing right now.

[06-Aug-19 09:33 AM] Thievery#4576
If you compare to BTC everything is red

[06-Aug-19 09:37 AM] Flint#6435
the main trading is paired with bitcoin, so do not pay attention to the price of the dollar! we just fall down and the only stop is $ 0.5 and if the problem is at least local $ 0.5 then the effect of "panic sales" will intensify and we are unlikely to recover at all - its sad((

[06-Aug-19 09:39 AM] Thievery#4576
Yea I don't even really pay attention to $ prices with alts anymore.  I only care about btc $ price

[06-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Flint#6435
for a month Komodo lost $ 100 million!!!!!!!!!!!! it's just awful - investors are disappointed and the price continues to fall - all important levels are destroyed!

[06-Aug-19 09:47 AM] Flint#6435
perhaps only the official DEX release will save the price now! otherwise, the project will continue to die and it may take years or not at all to revive the old prices! because the truth of the value of the token will not be and there will be no demand for it!

As I said before, the KMD team has good technology and a good community. We complain that the low price is not just a loss of money, but we hope that our partners will come up with ideas and promote KMD~ to help the community and projects. Attack each other

if kmd decides to go back down to 0.5$ where it last time bottomed in usd value ill be rdy with a fiat bag to buy a big chunk, its my fiat reserve for situations like that

[06-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Flint#6435
@Markus  when an asset loses 50% of its value and falls both on the rise and on the fall of bitcoin - such statements are already not relevant here - people just save their earned money and no one wants to check the project for durability at the cost of their own funds - it‚Äôs better to watch from the outside!(

[06-Aug-19 10:13 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
A person keeps selling KMD at a high price, and then buys it at the lowest point, and has 1000 KMD for one month.
One person insists on having 1000 KMDs a month.
Do you think that is correct? Who loves this project? Everyone has the same KMD support after 1 month.üòã

[06-Aug-19 10:13 AM] Tek#5253
the fuck you even mean

[06-Aug-19 10:13 AM] Flint#6435
$ 0.5 is undoubtedly a good price to buy! but here‚Äôs the problem: as soon as the price returns to $ 1.8 we will see massive sales again from those who bought at 1.5-1.8 and are now doubling twice! people will close deals at least to zero! and then they will go to bitcoin! You will see - remember the level of 1.8 from which we can then fall even lower than $ 0.5!!!

BTC BCH XMR DASH ETH seem to be atleast making fiat gains

depends on your time window, if you count since ATH, then KMD, DASH & BCH are about -91% -92%, basically the same range

[06-Aug-19 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is there some expected target for BTC dominance to go?

[06-Aug-19 10:38 AM] Flint#6435
@Tek  because their tokens have REAL use right now, starting from cross-border transfers and ending with payment for a cup of coffee! and where is the komodo token really REALLY used ??? We do not even have a DEX official final version and it is not known when it will be - maybe next year it is not a fact! therefore, people get rid of tokens that so far no one needs what ridiculous trading volumes say - they actually are not!(

1/ Folks keep asking when will altcoins start going up?

I expect alts will go up briefly @ Point A around ~70% btc dominance based on green trend channel. But big altcoin moves like in 2017 won't likely begin until ~80% @ Point B based on green & red trend channel conflue...

@grewalsatinder  maybe 83% as in 2016 - do not find any similarities? then, too, the altcoin market was dying in relation to bitcoin and then we saw the altcoin season - but this time we may not see it!

[06-Aug-19 10:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, heard something similar from others too
