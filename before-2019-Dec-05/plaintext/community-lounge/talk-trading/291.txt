It helps if you play this in about 5 different windows at the same time

[20-Nov-18 06:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'm not even worried.  It's all fake money anyways right?

How Could This Happen To Me (with lyrics)
I do not own this song, How Could This Happen to Me. This song belongs to Simple Plan.

How could this happen to me.....

[20-Nov-18 07:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Everybody screaming, I try to make a sound but noone hears me.

[20-Nov-18 07:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I wanna start this over again.  ðŸ˜‚

[20-Nov-18 07:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Truer words were never spoken for a day like today... especially that 2nd freaking verse.

[20-Nov-18 07:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
"And I can't explain what happened... and I cant erase the things ive done."

[20-Nov-18 07:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This isn't a love song, this is a song about Crypto.

[20-Nov-18 07:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
Itâ€™s gonna be alright. This dump, if anything, only confirms how threatening to the status quo this giant experiment really is... bitcoin can go to $2k and it still wont go away. Iâ€™d honestly be more worried about the world markets in general. Btc may just be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.

[20-Nov-18 07:48 AM] Malti#3948
if anything, this is good for people who  got in a year ago to do some cost averageing ðŸ˜‰

I followed the "Never invest more than you are willing to lose" mantra... and I've still got more than zero so lets keep riding this freaking bull!

[20-Nov-18 07:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
or bear.

[20-Nov-18 07:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
The financial powers that be have been inflating and subsequently popping bubbles ad nauseam for over a millennia now.

[20-Nov-18 07:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
The fact that xrp is not getting mercilessly dumped unlike everything else should be clue as to who runs that show.

[20-Nov-18 08:05 AM] Caglio#3337
exactly my thoughts

[20-Nov-18 08:05 AM] Caglio#3337
Even tho I think its a complete capitulation

[20-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Caglio#3337
Even the shit that survive wont hit its ath or nearly anymore

[20-Nov-18 08:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Whats your timeframe of analysis @Caglio  ?

[20-Nov-18 08:07 AM] Caglio#3337
Sorry I am not a native english speaker, so I dont get ur question

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Caglio#3337
But I am into crypto space like 18 months now

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] snowdamn#2414
all the moves are automated (up/down)
can't know where we're headed, but big bot money is moving this

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
When you say that they wont survive...  Forever... A year.

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
How long to they die or regain power?

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
In your opinion of course, not asking for an analysis

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Caglio#3337
Well I have my theory about prices going up eventually

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Reel Em In#1495
hard to belief we were at 1.60$ a few weeks ago, lol

[20-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Caglio#3337
But not soon, maybe in 2020, 2021

[20-Nov-18 08:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No crap @Reel Em In - How bout that 0.70 cent KMD.

[20-Nov-18 08:09 AM] Caglio#3337
I also think at least 85% of projects must die, and there need to be an actual use of it

[20-Nov-18 08:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
ðŸ‘†

[20-Nov-18 08:09 AM] Caglio#3337
I mean why do we even need 2020 coins ? for what ?

[20-Nov-18 08:10 AM] Caglio#3337
I am actually really mad at myself, cos I had a really nice profits, and now I have a really nice losses

[20-Nov-18 08:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
A good education is priceless

[20-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Caglio#3337
Its all about speculation here, I bet we all here researched a lot

[20-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Caglio#3337
Lets say Komodo project, its personally my favorite

[20-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Caglio#3337
But honestly ? who gives a fuck about it except us here ?

[20-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Caglio#3337
I doubt even 3% of the crypto world even know about it like they should

[20-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Caglio#3337
They dont, and even if they heard of it, they dont give a fuck

[20-Nov-18 08:13 AM] Caglio#3337
Hopefully this crypto capitulation can change something

[20-Nov-18 08:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
That just means only 3% of crypto investors understand the tech enough to be interested whats happening here.

[20-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Caglio#3337
I wish I can explain correctly what that means

[20-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Caglio#3337
But like I said, I am not a native english speaker, so I find problems expressing myself correctly

[20-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Caglio#3337
But most of the people in crypto arent there for the tech anyway

[20-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Caglio#3337
And really until now, there is not a real world usage in crypto, at least I cant say I see it

[20-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Caglio#3337
Sending large amounts of money ? Yeah lets be honest that is cool, but on the other hand volatility of that money is just plain sick, I mean if my local currency went 10 times down or up in last year.... Its just plain sick

[20-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Caglio#3337
And paying with crypto being easy ? Well maybe in some really cool countries it can work really easily, but in small and degenerate countries like mine, its not. Money or card works... so until blockchain actually start doing something crypto will die

[20-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Caglio#3337
Its just a speculation, and sorry for my blabbering, its just my view on the things

[20-Nov-18 08:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
Your english is very good, welcome to the kmd discord @Caglio

[20-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I am waiting any minute now for the announcement of some bank saying, well we've waited long enough, but this is a good entry point into btc for us

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
when their bags are obviously filled already

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] PHBA2061#2530
that huge red candle on kmd ... ðŸ˜¢

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But which would spark the next fomo bullrun

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
might be the meth talking tho

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362

I don't think they want to enter it, but rather kill it

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
they can make a shit ton of money from it

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
why would they want to kill it

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Sdunbar#5064
money won't mean anything if they lose their power

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Sdunbar#5064
fiat is the goose that lays golden eggs for them

[20-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Sdunbar#5064
they can already print as much as they want

[20-Nov-18 08:23 AM] Sdunbar#5064
they dont need to make money

[20-Nov-18 08:23 AM] Sdunbar#5064
they "make" it all the time

[20-Nov-18 08:23 AM] Sdunbar#5064
fiat is just a vehicle for their power
