S9 has been around for over a year that's stats are similar

[17-Sep-18 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so where is your counter argument`
My counter argument is that you're just picking shit out of your ass

[17-Sep-18 09:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`With a 4.2 gigawatt power draw Ethereum`
Did that number come from your left ass cheek or the right?

[17-Sep-18 09:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
.91 gigawatt for Ethereum learn to read

[17-Sep-18 09:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
760w x 1.2 million

[17-Sep-18 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`.91 gigawatt for Ethereum learn to read`
OK, so you changed the number on the next line (because that was a **quote from you**), did that number come from your left ass cheek or the right?

[17-Sep-18 09:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

`Bitmains E3 specs`
so GPUs just don't exist?

@PHBA2061 if 'ass' is too course for you, then I suggest you block me now and save some time

Like I said it's an estimate using the most popular hardware for the algo

[17-Sep-18 09:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Like I said it's an estimate using the most popular hardware for the algo`
Like I said:
`you're just making shit up based on some random extrapolation of some random equipment and no factual basis`

[17-Sep-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still waiting for you to show that these things you claim are "the most popular hardware for the algo" factually are...

[17-Sep-18 09:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And your reaching for straws  .  Name  a more popular bitcoin miner

[17-Sep-18 09:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Than the s9 series

[17-Sep-18 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh ffs, now your on the edge of saying "Prove to me that it's not raining when there's no rain falling from the sky"
1) the "s9 series" isn't "the S9i"
2) you're pretending that everything is 1 unit and not factually made up of multitudes of different size and brands and types

[17-Sep-18 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Like I said:
`you're just making shit up based on some random extrapolation of some random equipment and no factual basis`

[17-Sep-18 09:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Apparently the word "estimate " escapes you.

[17-Sep-18 09:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I estimate that 487,942 grapes are at the bottom of the sea
👆 equally meaningless as your made up stats based on cherry-picked units and no reality

[17-Sep-18 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You're claim was that there is more equipment on BTC than ETH and your support is picking 1 random piece for each and extrapolating backwards

[17-Sep-18 09:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Guys, take it easy

[17-Sep-18 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even if one were to accept picking 1 random piece for each and extrapolating backwards as a valid support, 3:1 still doesn't support a 30x value

[17-Sep-18 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in fact it invalidates your initial point

[17-Sep-18 09:22 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or the other way around, doesn't support your thesis that Ethereum should be worth more than it is .

[17-Sep-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I never said ETH should be worth more, I said that BTC is over-valued

[17-Sep-18 09:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Value is relative

[17-Sep-18 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and, back to the beginning of what I said, relative to **what**?

[17-Sep-18 09:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Personally, I despise the fact that ETH exists over ETC, but I'm still waiting for a single, rational argument that states why BTC is a more valuable (aka "better") "store of value" than ETH [specifically 30x] or KMD [specifically 6300x]....

[17-Sep-18 09:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ethereum in your case

[17-Sep-18 09:25 PM] jspook16#3059
It's rough in here today

[17-Sep-18 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's my example, not my case, but you're still missing the point....
Your initial reply was that it was relative to units of equipment (a thought which your own math proves to not be true)

[17-Sep-18 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it's relative to equipment, then a 3x in equipment doesn't equate to a 30x in value

[17-Sep-18 09:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not to mention that you still haven't even laid the foundation to support that BTC **is** a "store of value"

[17-Sep-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Store of value - Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_of_value
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved`
...
`Store Of Value - Investopedia
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/storeofvalue.asp
A store of value is an asset that maintains its value without depreciating.`

[17-Sep-18 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Personally, I defy anyone to show that BTC is "predictably useful" 😣

[17-Sep-18 09:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Notarizations...

[17-Sep-18 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC has notarizations? when did Core add that?

[17-Sep-18 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has to eat dinner, but will tell you how sadly wrong and poorly thought out the claim that BTC is a store of value because of data is when he gets back_

[17-Sep-18 09:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Usefulness isn't reliant upon core.  Also assuming 3x in hardware should equate to 3x in price is incorrect,  it doesn't factor in the additional factors that go along with that hardware increase ,  such as generation and transmission costs.

[17-Sep-18 09:37 PM] freakbros#9074
Is that computer genie sounds like him

[17-Sep-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`such as generation and transmission costs.`
yes, because 4MB of data costs so much more than 4MB of data

[17-Sep-18 09:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Electric costs dipshit

[17-Sep-18 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if anything, again, your claim is belied by math
the ever growing dag size =ever growing transmission costs

[17-Sep-18 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but I must eat now, my fat ass needs food

[17-Sep-18 09:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
btc & crypto in general are not traditionally considered stores of value, but in countries where hyperinflation reigns, it will be a "not so bad" store of value

💯 

[17-Sep-18 09:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Electric costs dipshit`
Yes, because 1 watt costs mush more than 1 watt

🤣 

[17-Sep-18 09:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A 1400 MW power plant costs more than 500 MW

[17-Sep-18 09:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And it's not proportional

[17-Sep-18 09:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The nuke plant I used to work at could power the entire Ethereum network and then some, there isn't a power plant in the world that can power the entire btc network

Haiduc is such a pleasant young man.  So well raised.  I bet he has a happy home life with a fabulous, uh, life partner, tons of friends and the respect of his peers and neighbors.

[17-Sep-18 09:55 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  up until now, i think btc still statistically prove that it is a better store of value than eth or kmd, if we look at the trading volume , drop from ATH, adoption ...  not sure about the future though

[17-Sep-18 09:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` i think btc still statistically prove that it is a better store of value than eth or kmd, if we look at the trading volume`
Turning it into something akin to a Ponzi scheme does not a "store of value" make

[17-Sep-18 10:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  akin to a Ponzi scheme ? how can you be sure about it ? it's not collapsed yet  🙂

What’s the deal with steemit

[17-Sep-18 10:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do they need to be shilled on notarization?

[17-Sep-18 10:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What’s wrong with their network?

[17-Sep-18 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`@un Haiduc akin to a Ponzi scheme ? how can you be sure about it ? it's not collapsed yet`
What I mean is that if the only claim to "value" is that you can sell it to the next guy for more, then it's not really much different on a base level

[17-Sep-18 10:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
ponzi schemes are by definition, centralized

[17-Sep-18 11:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by definition, so is Bitcoin in its current form

[18-Sep-18 12:27 AM] meatspoon#7860
So you assert that bitcoin is a centralized ponzi scheme in its current form. Which centralized/organized group or individual is at the top of the ponzi pyramid.?

[18-Sep-18 12:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@meatspoon If you don't think that Bitcoin is centralized, fork it, get more than 60% of the hashrate, and see if exchanges accept your fork as Bitcoin over Core 😉

[18-Sep-18 12:34 AM] meatspoon#7860
that isnt an answer, nor an argument

[18-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers @Hollowman9000 ive seen you guys mention steemit... what’s wrong with it?
