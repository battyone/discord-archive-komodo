also, managing notary node is really replacing your day job with notary node manager kinda level job

[13-Apr-19 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no matter how much you automate your stuff to whatever level possible, you always has to be present to fix the issue you have on your node

Curious to hear new applicants views on this.

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
else your node will fell behind in notarization ranks

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you have to accept that you just have to be present to fix your notary node

Administering a NN is much more work than i thought when i started

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

every minute that your NN is down is revenue lost, fact

I have seen myself looking for internet desperately in Cuba while i was in vacations to do some update or make sure all is well

[13-Apr-19 12:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I had to stop at mid highway to connect to nodes to be make some update or restart iguana or some daemon

[13-Apr-19 12:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought having a top notch AWS node will be good to have with automation, which @ns408 did a lot on our meshbits nodes.
All such automation didn't do much, neither the top notch AWS servers

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is those who have been persistantly available to their nodes ALL the time takes the lead

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not the automation, it does some good, but too much

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have had to carry my laptop literally everywhere this year just to be sure i am safe to make any fix

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] CrisF#3405
```I‚Äôd say most devs could but not a lot would.```
This expresses my thoughts very well.
With time and effort, I think  many could run a node and even become good at it.
I wonder how many would put that in over the longer term...
@FishyGuts  new applicant here :abusedsmily:

Its actually much more work intense than many other crypto jobs

[13-Apr-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why dedicated community members make the best candidates, especially those that have been #kmdlabs  notaries

[13-Apr-19 12:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And to be frank, at the prices that kmd had last year, the nodes were not paying enough for the amount of work being done

[13-Apr-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd very highly recommend the new notary node operators to be Totally commit yourself to Notary Nodes.
Else DO NOT RUN in the elections.

At one point it was less than $1k a month

[13-Apr-19 12:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Taking into account some admins pay almost $500 a month for servers

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Gordon Komodo the setup and maintenance seems to be able to be automated to a degree but no AI exists to spot and fix the problems that these capable people can.

i think we are already at close to 50 operators last year

[13-Apr-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The 1st year I did some dedication managing my 2 notary nodes. Did fine, not too much, go auto-reelected and elected somehow.
2nd year I did not manage my nodes myself entirely and left it to @ns408 and the automation.
focused on other programming stuff and learning, with as much less responsibilities I can have over my head.
did poor, I'm out of notary nodes, and don't wish to be a notary node now.
Being a Notary Node operator is a constant pressure to manage it. It is really like a 24/7 job.
much much much dedicated job than your normal 8-5 job.

most coins, even BTC, have majority of hashrate in the hands of 6 pool operators

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Family costs are intangible to all buy the NN, yet they are probably huge.

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers not sure if ppl will belive me, I paid 2200+ NZD per month for my both notary nodes all together.

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
and dont tell me that thousands of miners are contributing the hashrate, the reality is that the pool operator controls what is mined

just because I was trying to keep things on AWS and changing an IP is a mess once it's used from beginning.

[13-Apr-19 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the most best option is having a Co-location server. Your very own!

[13-Apr-19 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It was best experience in my 1st year having a colocation own server

[13-Apr-19 12:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
AWS is not good in my opinion for Notary Nodes

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Speaking of nodes, does running Komodo in native mode and leaving it on all day help at all?

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hardware is very very important. Dont think that being cheap will help in anyway

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, running a full node helps network connectivity

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Kitchen Table being a client node of any blockchain daemon with full node helps the network

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
especially if you have very good bandwidth

[13-Apr-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I started with a cheaper server and it basically cost me the auto-reelection.

[13-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Well that's good to know. I've been having mine running non stop for years. Just making sure.

@jl777c when our notary nodes and dPoW system started, I expressed NEM's masternode kinda setup, which was automated.
that is different, and after this much of time and experience, I think our elections and notary nodes management is one unique system that I think nobody is doing.

all I know is that anyone that thinks being a NN is an "easy way to get rich" is either delusion, misinformed, so poor that they don't understand what "rich" is, or a combination of those

[13-Apr-19 12:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Imagine having a full linux admin job that pays around $150k a year anywhere but doing it during a bear market that pays a fraction of that.

@Kitchen Table as to running a node, I am literally writing a guide right now on how to set one up on the www.nodl.it - I have been running KMD and ARRR full nodes for over a week.  It will be out in a few days.   Special thanks to @radix42 for getting the previous port back up and running.
