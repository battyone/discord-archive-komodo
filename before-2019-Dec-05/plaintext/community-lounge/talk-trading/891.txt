if it's a KMD article, just post title and say 'go look it up'

[05-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Malti#3948
if it's a GRIN/BEAM article we post direct link and upvote like crazy so it gets deleted for brigading

nah

[05-Jul-19 08:25 AM] Malti#3948
i think we can agree on no more direct links to KMD articles to make sure 'brigading' doesn't happen

[05-Jul-19 08:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
should have bought doge ðŸ˜„

[05-Jul-19 08:41 AM] Malti#3948
imagine what a binance listing could do to Pirate ðŸ˜‰

[05-Jul-19 08:53 AM] jorian#4555
guys what is brigading

[05-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
why try to build tech, when you could just be a coin about a dog meme?

[05-Jul-19 08:53 AM] jorian#4555
why is reddit being childish

[05-Jul-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
i see

[05-Jul-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
@siu - Chainmakers was it you linking and asking for upvotes? ðŸ˜ 

[05-Jul-19 08:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
any time you have people following a link into reddit and upvoting something, youll get it banned and your reddit account banned too

[05-Jul-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
ok, it did smell a bit of shilling

[05-Jul-19 08:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Cant we repost and people search for it?

[05-Jul-19 08:55 AM] jorian#4555
someone ought to write a good blog about why a truly decentralized mobile exchange is so important

[05-Jul-19 08:55 AM] jorian#4555
with the links to SEC guidance etc

[05-Jul-19 08:55 AM] jorian#4555
and then post it there

[05-Jul-19 08:55 AM] jorian#4555
too late now, momentum over

[05-Jul-19 08:55 AM] jorian#4555
on that matter, i didn't yet receive an invitation to test

[05-Jul-19 08:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Someone could be you

[05-Jul-19 08:58 AM] jorian#4555
i'm a nobody

[05-Jul-19 08:58 AM] jorian#4555
waiting for kmd marketing team to write something cool

[05-Jul-19 08:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If everyone has the same feeling nothing will get done

[05-Jul-19 08:59 AM] jorian#4555
:troll:

[05-Jul-19 08:59 AM] jorian#4555
true

[05-Jul-19 08:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Nobody can become a somebody

[05-Jul-19 09:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Understand the problem, seek out someone that has the solution.

[05-Jul-19 09:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We are all waiting for the mythical marketing team to do something

[05-Jul-19 09:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why not take the initiative  and do it outselves

[05-Jul-19 09:02 AM] jorian#4555
well they hired a freaking marketing bureau, why would some guy do it better? ðŸ˜›

[05-Jul-19 09:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why would you leave your bank balance up to someone else?

[05-Jul-19 09:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Community marketing is as good if not better than a professionals in this space.

[05-Jul-19 09:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What we lack in professionalism, we make up in numbers and passion

[05-Jul-19 09:05 AM] jorian#4555
community marketing fails when there is a select group in that same community that is getting paid for the thing i would be doing for free

[05-Jul-19 09:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So it is fine to sit back and let our fate be controlled by a marketing team, or we take responsibility for our investments and give it the best chance it has to get out there

[05-Jul-19 09:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is a very self defeating way of looking at it. I wont help increase my net worth because someone is being paid to help increase my net worth?

[05-Jul-19 09:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why not both do it and increase it 2x?

[05-Jul-19 09:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This goes to the heart of the problem, if you feel like you should be paid to market a tech/coin, why are you in the coin in question?

[05-Jul-19 09:09 AM] jansako#3330
the last one I disagree...

[05-Jul-19 09:09 AM] jansako#3330
you work you get paid for it

[05-Jul-19 09:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Let's just sit around doing nothing and wait for marketing....

[05-Jul-19 09:10 AM] jansako#3330
you can't make someone do stuff for free. the other thing is that if they don;t they should not complain either...

[05-Jul-19 09:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well that is my point, if you do nothing you have nothing to complain about ðŸ˜„

[05-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jorian#4555
i market through different ways. the komodo team hired a marketing bureau to help them, i will not stand in their way. a coordinated marketing effort is (should be) better than random messages from random community members

[05-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jansako#3330
unless you offered to do it paid and were rejected... :troll:

[05-Jul-19 09:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Also not to shoot your point down about not being paid, really if you are a NN you are getting paid and it is especially contradictory when you have a for profit business built off the tech....yet you dont promote the tech lol

[05-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jansako#3330
more marketing is better though, for sure.

[05-Jul-19 09:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jorian sure  but is there any rules set down by the Komodo CEO about not promoting in a certain way?

[05-Jul-19 09:13 AM] jorian#4555
hehe rules ðŸ˜„

[05-Jul-19 09:13 AM] jansako#3330
I thought if you have an NN, you are getting paid to run an NN and not marketing campaigns... unless that was promised during  the election campaign

[05-Jul-19 09:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Does @Hollowman9000 get told off for not posting on twitter because his messages goes against the  Komodo HR policy?

[05-Jul-19 09:13 AM] Lumbi#8378

[05-Jul-19 09:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not saying he has to do marketing, but being a NN you should believe in the tech / project to promote it.

[05-Jul-19 09:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What is the point of saying im not getting paid so i wont do it

[05-Jul-19 09:14 AM] jorian#4555
i'm saying there are people getting paid to do a job, and i'm not. so why would i then do the job

[05-Jul-19 09:14 AM] jorian#4555
it doesn't make any sense

[05-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jorian#4555
i trust brownsheet productions

[05-Jul-19 09:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You are making the point someone should do it, this someone would need to be paid by the team for them to do it.

[05-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jansako#3330
this is normal progression from a community project to a commercial/enterprise one

[05-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jansako#3330
are we there yet? not sure...

[05-Jul-19 09:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jansako this comes down to this mentality that someone else will do it, they may or may not but why would you take the chance with your funds?

[05-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jansako#3330
sure, but he may have other conflicting demands for his time

[05-Jul-19 09:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why would you as someone that is part of the community/project that has a interest in the price/utility going up, not do everything you can to help the team achieve it?

[05-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jansako#3330
matter of priorities

[05-Jul-19 09:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is not about jorian, it is about the community in general

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Does anyone think i am a dev? Yet somehow we have hyperDEX and the ledger app.

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jansako#3330
same argument though. If one can do it but won't, it reflects on that person.

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If i did not want to solve problems that i had with the tech who will?

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
you would be interfering with what the team's plans are. i think the matter boils down to komodo corporate vs komodo community. too much overlap there to have a healthy community wanting to do things for free when there is a team that is getting paid to do the same

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What is the teams plan?

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont know what that is

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
marketing plan

[05-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
they hired a bureau

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So what?

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] Lumbi#8378
trolls abound -- also in group dynamics there is a strategy to bring others down to elevate themselves

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Do they control you?

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] jorian#4555
re-read what i just wrote above

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Does james set down the rule no one can do any marketing?

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I did

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] jansako#3330
JL is all about do whatever, nobody stops yuou

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You want to get paid for something

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] Lumbi#8378
I call it the 'fallacy of respectability or professionalism'

[05-Jul-19 09:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
fallacy of someone else will get shit done

[05-Jul-19 09:20 AM] jansako#3330
ðŸ˜ƒ for sure

[05-Jul-19 09:21 AM] jansako#3330
All I am saying that is it every person's choice to go the extra mile or not. We can justify both why we do it and why we don't.

[05-Jul-19 09:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If people will only do something if they get paid, their motivation is to get paid.

[05-Jul-19 09:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Let's just leave it at that. Indirect and long term rewards means nothing.

[05-Jul-19 09:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
More utility that means more clients for them means nothing

[05-Jul-19 09:22 AM] jansako#3330
Sure, but that reflects on them and where they re in their life.

[05-Jul-19 09:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD worth more via their NN means nothing

[05-Jul-19 09:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No it reflects a short term ME ME mentality

[05-Jul-19 09:23 AM] jansako#3330
now you are going extreme a bit.. I am done.

[05-Jul-19 09:23 AM] cascrypto#8206
getting hyped up I see

[05-Jul-19 09:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Let's just wait for James and the marketing team to solve all of our problems in life. All good, waiting for my lambos

[05-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jansako#3330
come on, it is not <------------ all the way here or -------------------------------> all the way there...

[05-Jul-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Did most of my work for free in bear to create as much value as possible, not sure if we succeeded or not but it was a lot of work.

[05-Jul-19 09:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@blackjok3r but there were paid coders....

[05-Jul-19 09:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why code when there are people getting paid to do the same thing ðŸ˜›

[05-Jul-19 09:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh wait.....you hold KMD and you want its value to go up.....
