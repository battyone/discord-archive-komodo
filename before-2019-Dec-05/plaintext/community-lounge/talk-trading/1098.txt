oppressing people while most think they are free isn't really enough to get their rocks off lol

when everyone is fully under control and knows they are, yet can't do a damn thing about it, that's the real goal

RedFOX Labs had entered into a contract with K64, however K64 did not honor its end of the contract and no funds were transferred. As such, we have ended our relationship with K64 and are otherwise reserving and considering our options and remedies.

@BanHammer I have no discord banning/admin privledges. I simply indicated that pasting private chats of jl777 out of context in public channels was likely to get him more banished than jl777 and other already made him. Not me, them. Just so you understand

[29-Aug-19 11:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
Dwy's NN nodes were purchased so he would stop causing problems with other NNs, I offered, but KMD core team members ended up purchasing them. Not sure why he is accusing me of trying to buy them as some offense

[30-Aug-19 03:53 AM] hastrup#8742
Is it just me or is there something very wrong about somone buying NN. In my mind it's the same as buying a politician. Maybe somone can explain to in layman terms why it is ok to do such a thing. Why bother to have an election when you just can buy your NN

[30-Aug-19 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a fari few of us would refuse to sell... at least I will not be

[30-Aug-19 04:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think dwy was abusing the privilege and figured out how to fuck with the network somehow.

[30-Aug-19 04:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
getting more rewards or something I think

[30-Aug-19 04:53 AM] digital bullion#8223
I believe it was stated that a node can be sold to an existing and therefore, 'elected' NN operator, is that correct? 

or can the node be sold to anyone?

[30-Aug-19 05:25 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
on the other hand the fact that someone can sell NN proves it's a dencetralized not-controlled-by-dev system

[30-Aug-19 06:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
How is it different to offering revshare, same thing.

[30-Aug-19 06:04 AM] hastrup#8742
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã that fact is true. but it makes it that one can buy alot of NN and that is centralized. Or am I barking at the wrong tree?

[30-Aug-19 06:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Everything can be done for a price, some are in it for the money, some are in it for the project

[30-Aug-19 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully operators dont sell.. Not a lot you can do on chain to enforce these things

[30-Aug-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Selling a node is a very bad idea... because the new owener and the old both have the privkeys... You cant trust eitehr party

[30-Aug-19 06:07 AM] hastrup#8742
@blackjok3r thx for the info. that is a good prevention for selling.

@hyperDEX I have seen a couple og vids but not heard any about kmd. He is moving and have stop big time mining or whatever that means

He did a video when he tried to get elected in S2

NN should be  given to people that help the network not leech off it. That should be a metric for elections

[30-Aug-19 06:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Also no revshare

[30-Aug-19 06:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
With all the people jumping up and down about why marketing sucks, well here is a guy with 81k subs on youtube (considering the watch rate probably lots are fake) he rode on a platform of, im a youtube guy i have things to offer, then nothing.

[30-Aug-19 06:14 AM] hastrup#8742
@hyperDEX in a Perfect world yes But this is expected to happen in first years when the price of kmd it worth anything significant. Project can funded by the nn so that creates natural Competition and leech of the nn will go away

[30-Aug-19 06:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We should expect more from people running for election.

[30-Aug-19 06:17 AM] hastrup#8742
@hyperDEX I agree

[30-Aug-19 06:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The fact people are more worried about getting some rev share rather than electing people that cares about the network is shooting themselves in the foot due to price depreciation

[30-Aug-19 06:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So the problem is not that there are people that want to take advantage, the problem is that the community/whales cares so little about their assets to do what is necessary to make it rise.

[30-Aug-19 06:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There are people that run a NN running at a loss, it is not a profit making exercise. Unfortunately that is not the majority of NN any more (unless they have no choice like KMD keeps crashing)

[30-Aug-19 06:50 AM] tolken#2655
Anyone have an actual Binance.com link that says they will be shutting US customers out? Amazingly difficult information to find. Trying to find exact date when they plan on it. One website said Sept 12th.

@blackjok3r  things change in time so NN operators may do actually whatever they want (if sth happens an they need money - they sell); to prevent selling NN revenue should be high enough (on the other hand if revenue high - attracts more people willing to buy it). Another option to secure would be to increase NN number even more. Both would require to increase network costs probably?

[30-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Selling was done here to stop being spitted on after dedicating and devoting myself with no recognition, I m not the only one that was thinking about that, but I m the only one who did it ^^

(last year artik did it also)

[30-Aug-19 11:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
others reasons to sell but mentionning it here would be seen as bad behaviour, and I don t want those dramas anymore. no energy for that

[30-Aug-19 11:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
@digital bullion only elected notary nodes of the current year can purchase a NN node from another elected NN of the current year, as per James

[30-Aug-19 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
No unelected entity can purchase a NN, it's mostly for "edge cases" like people going to the hospital or other life emergencies. It doesn't happen often.

[30-Aug-19 11:44 AM] hastrup#8742
@dukeleto so it is possible for me to buy a nn. But it don't happens often.

[30-Aug-19 11:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
@hastrup are you a current KMD notary node operator of S3?

[30-Aug-19 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
you are not on my list

[30-Aug-19 11:46 AM] hastrup#8742
No I'm not. What are the obstacles that prevent me for buying one?
