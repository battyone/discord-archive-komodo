@grewalsatinder that still will not let me get 1440 blocks per day 😛

[09-Oct-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I want them all

From a financial standpoint, I can't see but 1 or 2 people even having the ability to corrupt that many nodes and still have enough left over to profit from

[09-Oct-18 10:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And Warren Buffet hasn't the interest in crypto, so that leaves 1 or 0
Hyperbole, but still...

[09-Oct-18 10:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I suspect that when people talk about the current working tech like dPoW and it's working they usually think in linear progress terms and miss the evolution part of the technology.
In software engineering (or any engineering/science) things are constantly improved and evolved. If we never had such thing as evolving tech, we wouldn't have the computers at all and internet to have this chat communication to talk on. 😅 
I expect dPoW tech to evolve constantly by every year as new Notary Node Operators keeps added to the 64 Notary Nodes team elected by community.
These are the people who will help majorly evolve this very important part of the Komodo Platform ecosystem.
It'll be even more efficient, much more secure and better managed that how it is done today.
If Bitcoin took a decade to reach where it is here today, we are ONLY in 2+ years of Komodo Platform's dPoW evolution!
The second wave of Notary Nodes is multiple X times improved operators than the 1st year.
It's the best architecture design I have witnessed in my career which brings the technology, free open source software and developers, technology enthusiasts together to build and work together at such beautiful and efficient way.

Take a look at the % of devs
Next take a look at the number of people trading crypto
After a quick cal ... look at the shit in the top 100 CMC
It appears obvious to me at least that in order for KMD to really make a splash, we need a very basic interface that provides atomic swaps in real time and drop the utxo that quite frankly confuses the hell outa me.
Could be easier said than done, but I think this is what will prove our point

[09-Oct-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
use swap tokens

[09-Oct-18 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@house Short of just "hiding" the process, I'm not sure how you could take the UTXOs out of a process that depends on UTXOs

[09-Oct-18 10:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then test HyperDEX

[09-Oct-18 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and also wait for the backend protocol and daemon update via mm2.0

[09-Oct-18 10:17 AM] house#8741
I mean ... no exchange does utxo ... on the surface it is decimals which is what makes sense to the typical trader not utxo

[09-Oct-18 10:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, we need a hyperish thing that isn't electrum

[09-Oct-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
doing cross chain atomic swaps will always be more confusing than onchain token atomic swaps

[09-Oct-18 10:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no exchange does utxo `
Because you give them everything and you're trading slots on a balance sheet, not actual coinage

[09-Oct-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
mm1.0 demonstrated what it can do and what is possible, and practically gave a taste what BarterDEX tech can do.
Now the other developers has joined and improving on it, it will evolve as even better and already working on the solutions to make it even more easier for the expected masses to come to Komodo Platform tech.

[09-Oct-18 10:19 AM] house#8741
Yes, so we make it ‘look’ like what is standard.
Again it must be easier said than in practice

[09-Oct-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
but it will be slower

[09-Oct-18 10:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, and yet industry is figuring out the best user interface for a cryptocurrency for existing bank fed userbase 😅

[09-Oct-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant make a transatlantic flight look like walking to your next door neighboors

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've went over it every way I can think of, and in fact drove @grewalsatinder to the point where he refused to work with me for a while 😝, and I cannot see any way to make it both seamless and hidden

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I'm cool with you mate. 🙂

[09-Oct-18 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hence the "for a while" 👍🏼

End of the day people don’t care what goes into developing pills to treat pain, they just use it
If you had to ask them what [laboratory lingo here] is required, they end up going to the local astrologist

[09-Oct-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the airport security and entry and exit passport control makes it not so user friendly

[09-Oct-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
no matter how much you want to make it painless

[09-Oct-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and planes take hours to fly across oceans

[09-Oct-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you want that to be like buying a beer at the corner store

[09-Oct-18 10:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`End of the day people don’t care what goes into developing pills to treat pain, they just use it`
Yes, but to carry that over as an example...
Take 2 pills without counting pills or only having 1...

[09-Oct-18 10:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
basically it is a laboratory tech, still.

[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The whole blockchain industry.

[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it simply wont happen

[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
atomic swaps are for people allergic to KYC, who want to control their funds 100% of the time

[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the extremists

[09-Oct-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont value those things, then do token trading

[09-Oct-18 10:24 AM] house#8741
Hmmm, what a about a delay in process but a an action that cannot fail behind scenes ?

[09-Oct-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it will need to trust that the multisig deposit address signers wont collude, but it can be a seamless experience

[09-Oct-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
@house when you can tell me how to prevent two independent p2p nodes to always stay online and never do anything bad, let me know

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] house#8741
Hmmm

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Hmmm, what a about a delay in process but a an action that cannot fail behind scenes ?`
How do you make a user sit there for a minute or 2 without "this thing is shit and makes me wait for nothing"?

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The people who understand the importance of privacy, understand Tor Browser no matter how slow it is, still helps them.
Disregarding how slow it is as compare to their clear-internet they still use it. till date.
Tor is much faster today as compare to few years ago.

[09-Oct-18 10:25 AM] house#8741
I mean with an incorruptible process delay but an immediate action

[09-Oct-18 10:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can't make a tx go any faster than the chain goes

[09-Oct-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
@house when you can tell me how to prevent two independent p2p nodes to always stay online and never do anything bad, let me know

Ok, there are some things here that I obviously am limited in understanding

[09-Oct-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
also, can you find me an ice cream that has no calories but tastes as good as the real thing, and also wont cause any medical problems?

BarterDEX is live, on-chain trading/swapping

[09-Oct-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
I want the 0 calorie ice cream

[09-Oct-18 10:28 AM] house#8741
Yes it is good, but utxo is confusing

[09-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
do you have various denomination bills for your fiat currency?

[09-Oct-18 10:28 AM] house#8741
Yes ?

[09-Oct-18 10:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you have used the Modem to connect to internet, that's kinda the analogy way you can say we are at with BarterDEX.
there is yet to see an evolution like ADSL to Fiberoptic 😅

[09-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the restriction of swapping 1 utxo for 1 utxo is artificial

[09-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you dont mind paying txfees to create the perfect utxo to trade with the other party

[09-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but BTC fee market kills that

[09-Oct-18 10:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but utxo is confusing`
It's the basic building block of crypto (or at least bitcoin-based crypto)
in USD terms, a penny is 1 UTXO, a dime is another UTXO, a $50 bill is another UTXO....

[09-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and adding another delay to remove the utxo 1:1 requirement with the txfees on top, likely not good

[09-Oct-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
except utxo can be for any amount

{Reactions}
👆🏼 (2) 

[09-Oct-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and barterDEX requires to swap a utxo for one coin for exactly one utxo of another coin

[09-Oct-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if this is too confusing, then you need to pay txfees to automatically consolidate utxo with the txfees, or do token trading

[09-Oct-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the assets CC DEX deals with balances

[09-Oct-18 10:32 AM] house#8741
Talking general population, they are the ones we need here

[09-Oct-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
not really

[09-Oct-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
be careful what you ask for

[09-Oct-18 10:32 AM] house#8741
Hmmm, ok, that is good point

[09-Oct-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if the general population did atomic swaps, it would totally saturate all blockchains

i dont want to do any extra work for my 0 cal ice cream

[09-Oct-18 10:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbt, the "confusing" part is the fact that most people don't understand the basics of the currencies. They are much tourists like going to a foreign country and handing the shop keeper a wad of cash and saying "just take however many is right"

[09-Oct-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
blending and freezing is way too much work

[09-Oct-18 10:34 AM] house#8741
That is a good analogy genie  🤔

[09-Oct-18 10:36 AM] house#8741
Is it possible to piggyback on a utxo with a token ... like if I use my debit card in another country? It happens behind the scenes

[09-Oct-18 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in a way, that's what etomic does; does it not?

[09-Oct-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
assets CC implements a DEX for tokens

[09-Oct-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
you dont have to worry about utxo

[09-Oct-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just amounts

[09-Oct-18 10:38 AM] house#8741
Not familiar with it
I guess still same problem with the different sized’notes’

[09-Oct-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
tokens can represent real crypto in an MGW deposit address

[09-Oct-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810

just amounts

[09-Oct-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the utxo problem is gone for assets CC DEX

[09-Oct-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it implements basically ERC20 + one of the ETH DEX projects

[09-Oct-18 10:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if understanding UTXO is really really hard for a newbie or anyone, just replace the word
"Coin" and "Note" or "Bill" with "UTXO"
when you talk to someone in case you ever have to use a physical Cash.

[09-Oct-18 10:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just analogy.

[09-Oct-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is it

[09-Oct-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but it can be for any specific amount

[09-Oct-18 10:41 AM] house#8741
Yes

[09-Oct-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as it is in a single utxo

[09-Oct-18 10:42 AM] house#8741
Lightbulb power surge ... thank you

[09-Oct-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but the problem is that people might nod their head and say "yes I understand" but really they dont and they cant figure out why they cant do a swap that they dont have the utxo for

[09-Oct-18 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, I don't care if you have a $10 UTXO, I only want a specific single $4.5947374 Coin/Bill/UTXO
Nothing more, nothing less. 😉

[09-Oct-18 10:43 AM] house#8741
Am I able to creat the combatable size utxo/note in BarterDEX ?
