Anyone wanna buy my VRSC LOL

selling 1000vrsc for 2950kmd - roughly 3 blocks a day = 600vrsc a day, by next halving thats 18,000 vrsc üòõ
thats 35,000vrsc in 5 months time roughly. Presuming a 40mil supply by the 5th month, at rank 200-300 in coinmarketcap
and thats still $1 a coin.

"selling 1000vrsc for 2950kmd...and thats still $1 a coin"
So, you value KMD at 34¬¢? dafuq?

[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
No

[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
even at rank 100-200 on cmc

[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
vrsc would still be $1 each, (though cmc doesnt mean much)

[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can expect it to not be placed under 200 shitcoins, even at 50c a coin

[29-Jun-18 03:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
that puts you at 35,000x.5 = 12500

[29-Jun-18 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
2.95:1 is a steal for a coin that's advertised to mine better with a CPU than the fastest GPU?
One of us is looking at mining the wrong way

[29-Jun-18 04:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
All I know is the stake rewards are pretty nice atm

[29-Jun-18 04:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
but I have accumulated way more than enough and I miss my kmd üò¶

[29-Jun-18 04:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
All I know is someone must be daft to make that trade or hate KMD üòõ

[29-Jun-18 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd just be happy if VRSC worked on like any flavor of Linux besides Ubuntu and then I could mine it too

[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have it working on Debian9 with a CPU without any AVX or AES instructions.

[29-Jun-18 05:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it would take me 87 man hours to update all of my stuff to deb 9

[29-Jun-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Which idiot dumped kmd now

[29-Jun-18 07:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
The Blockfolio App has now Trades and Orderbooks for BarterDEX.
The Orderbook pair yet inverted but they will fix that soon. Also on the first page the price is inverted.

To Test OOT/KMD is best as it has the most activity

@CHMEX need to invert maybe?

[29-Jun-18 08:31 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes I let the guy know. I see from  the serverlogs that they pull the inverted

[29-Jun-18 08:31 AM] jorian#4555

@siu - Chainmakers   whats the charts looking like?  15k inc?

[29-Jun-18 09:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If weekly candle closes below bb, its going to be tough

[29-Jun-18 09:34 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Again

[29-Jun-18 09:48 AM] jeezy#3408
it felt so wrong to change some KMD to fiat at 33-35k

[29-Jun-18 09:48 AM] jeezy#3408
glad I did now it feel even worse

Last time we hit 17-18k as floor

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[slack] <cascrypto> feel your pain hollow and the worst about it , JL777 did warn us and told to sell if we where not patiente. hurts being greedy ;0)

[29-Jun-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes I did recommend to sell 2 years worth of fiat needs during the bull run, those that listened are not caring too much about day to day prices. I dont think the bear will last a full 2 years, just better to have fiat and not need it that th eother way

[29-Jun-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <cascrypto> you are still the one to blame james, i hate you please keep developing

[29-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763

It's very concerning to think there are people who aren't setting aside money/have a stable stream of income to support themselves during a bear market

[29-Jun-18 02:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I cashed a good buffer of fiat to survive for long, but as meshbits came along kinda half of that went to that, along with the taxes paid üò¶

[29-Jun-18 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so anything going into bank means not a good idea..... but still it was much better cashing out the bull market

[29-Jun-18 02:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

$KMD #KOMODO

Why this coin is in bargain zone right now, check the pictures. 

Everything bottomed out, RSI on ATL. Bullish divergence on other timeframes. KMD/BTC & KMD/USD back in accumulation zone. 

That looks good.

It's not like *not giving away ETH* helps anyway
