In case you havent noticed

[24-Oct-18 05:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We have been in a correction for the past 10 months üòÑ

[24-Oct-18 05:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
this 'pump' to 22k

[24-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
is shit

[24-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Tek#5253
I only joined KMD lik a month ago so.

[24-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ahaa

[24-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Tek#5253
here comes the dump

[24-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Tek#5253
wonder if whalebro is hiding

[24-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Tek#5253
I think Dash is about to make moves

[24-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Whalebro isnt done accumulating

[24-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You dont just accumulate 7M kmd

[24-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Tek#5253
i know but he's gone for now

[24-Oct-18 05:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And then not go for a sweet sweet pump to 70k

[24-Oct-18 05:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Check the graph for november/december last year to get an idea

[24-Oct-18 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
> check the bubble

[24-Oct-18 05:41 PM] Tek#5253
yeah bro that isn't happening for atleast a few years

[24-Oct-18 05:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sssshhh

[24-Oct-18 05:43 PM] BlockTech#6895
I have to agree with Tek.. i don't think the new ATH is for now, probably more end 2019.

[24-Oct-18 05:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A man can hope

[24-Oct-18 05:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But you are probably right

[24-Oct-18 05:44 PM] Tek#5253
Dash was having major adoptoin in Venezuela

[24-Oct-18 05:45 PM] Tek#5253
I don't like the coin in particular but I'll ride the news/venezula news

[24-Oct-18 06:21 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@Tek there are no corrections just after a breakout. the move has to complete or rally has to fail the restest. So far all points to completing the move

[24-Oct-18 06:22 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
also whale bro is reseting his wall every hour now and scoops it up a little bit, he changed gears

[24-Oct-18 06:22 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
in offtime he has some 5-10btc buy orders

[24-Oct-18 06:23 PM] BlockTech#6895
yup, whale is at 21k96 now

[24-Oct-18 06:23 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
there might be some consolidation play around 23k, but other than that I don't see a point in selling now. you won't see 19500 since that is even below the triangle

[24-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Tek#5253
ah fuck whale bro is back

[24-Oct-18 06:24 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
momentum is already way ahead of that

[24-Oct-18 06:24 PM] BlockTech#6895
I've been day trading this last week, i actually lost 10% of my stack üò¢

[24-Oct-18 06:25 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
ouch

[24-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Tek#5253
why doesn't whale bro make smaller 10k buy walls

[24-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Tek#5253
what is his end game

[24-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Tek#5253
oh he just pamped it

[24-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Alice#9607
The whale takes in a huge load of shrimp

[24-Oct-18 06:26 PM] BlockTech#6895
he is bored, he want to eat it all ! XD

[24-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Tek#5253
he might gets some fills

[24-Oct-18 06:27 PM] Tek#5253
yes hes getting fills

[24-Oct-18 06:28 PM] Tek#5253
weird bots

[24-Oct-18 06:28 PM] Tek#5253
the moment he removes his wall they start dumping

@coindesk I'm curious why an important detail, namely dPoW (delayed proof of work) by @KomodoPlatform was left out of the article? This was actually the main reason why @geocold51 didn't attempt attack on @einsteiniumcoin

[24-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Alice#9607

[24-Oct-18 06:42 PM] BlockTech#6895
Yes , it's like every time ^^ and since forever here ^^ bot -trying-  **manipulating** the price and pushing kmd down.

[24-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Yassin#3685
i have see this several time, not just Kmd

[24-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Yassin#3685
some crypto also

[24-Oct-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
"trying" -> "has been"

[24-Oct-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you see what happens as soon as bro-whal removes the wall, the price is pushed down 50 sats

[24-Oct-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
just imagine this happening day in day out. that is how the price can go from 50k sats to 15k sats

[24-Oct-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a pretty big downward push, but it has to avoid big buys as that would use up the available capital

[24-Oct-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
then there is that annoying 0.01 sales bot that triggers to make the previous sales look like a disaster zone (if you dont look at the total amount)

[24-Oct-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i think that is to fool other bots into thinking price is going lower

[24-Oct-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810

did whalebro get his fill

[24-Oct-18 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
or did he removed the wall

[24-Oct-18 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
is he done?

[24-Oct-18 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
i didn't watch for a few

[24-Oct-18 06:59 PM] BlockTech#6895
he removed it.

[24-Oct-18 06:59 PM] BlockTech#6895
he has still at least 75BTC

fomo started? momentum increase

[24-Oct-18 07:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that we went a bit above the resistance level

[24-Oct-18 07:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is why buying is starting to pick up now

[24-Oct-18 07:13 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Maybe the whale is here to destroy the bots. And they only have 1kmd left hence the 0.01s lol

I just checked the top gainers on on cmc and it was like clicking whats trending on youtube. I have no clue what 98% of them are

@BradyDale Any reason why you are not mentioning @KomodoPlatform dPoW solutions to mitigate 51% attacks on @einsteiniumcoin which prevented @geocold51 and @forkwitch from successfully attacking the chain?

its just crazy that we can get ignored like that.

[24-Oct-18 07:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we need MOAR noise

[24-Oct-18 07:25 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i don't get it though. what does this 0.01 kmd do? only fake sell volume right? since they are so low, they don't actually bring price down,.

[24-Oct-18 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i think some bots (and people) see a sea of red, panic and sell

[24-Oct-18 07:26 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
before there was general sell pressure and the whale ate those all up, he bought like 100 btc worth

[24-Oct-18 07:26 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
hmm okay, makes sense in that regard
