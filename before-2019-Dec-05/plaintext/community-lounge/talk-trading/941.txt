Thank you Alen

[17-Jul-19 03:51 PM] Caglio#3337
I will check it out, I am sick of coinbase

[17-Jul-19 03:51 PM] alen#3721
No problem bro

[17-Jul-19 03:51 PM] Caglio#3337
I just put on the paper my buys in last year

[17-Jul-19 03:51 PM] Caglio#3337
And fuck my life I left them pretty much money

[17-Jul-19 03:56 PM] alen#3721
So im cro you have to pay 15% on crypto profits?

[17-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[17-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Its called tax on extra income or smt like that

[17-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Caglio#3337
I can get out all the money I put into coinbase or any other server without paying taxes

[17-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Caglio#3337
and up to 500 euros profits

[17-Jul-19 03:58 PM] Caglio#3337
All above that is 15$

[17-Jul-19 03:58 PM] Caglio#3337
15%

[17-Jul-19 03:58 PM] Caglio#3337
so they actually let you take out extra paycheck, cos our paychecks here are like 500 euros

[17-Jul-19 03:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, I was thinking if I decide to take out money, ill use that peer2krd thingie

[17-Jul-19 03:59 PM] Caglio#3337
Or somethng else, Im not giving them 15%

[17-Jul-19 03:59 PM] Caglio#3337

the momentum from mm1 is back. and mm2 works amazing

[17-Jul-19 04:23 PM] alen#3721
Thats bad.
Here in slo, there is no tax on it..unless you actively trade more than 180 days per year..you have to give them evidence on this

[17-Jul-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
how can you prove that you didnt trade on 181 days?

[17-Jul-19 04:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Skip every other day

How‚Äôs Czech Republic on crypto taxes

[17-Jul-19 04:40 PM] jansako#3330
I would 'guess' similar as Slovakia,  treated like regular income, so taxes like anything else

[17-Jul-19 04:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
atomic dex is live in public beta. crypto market could care less. kmd could launch satellites tomorrow and price wouldn't budge.

[17-Jul-19 04:44 PM] altcoinist#1501
My country charges 15 percent of income. When I sell  100 usd worth of btc do I have to pay taxes or?

[17-Jul-19 04:45 PM] altcoinist#1501
Anyone knows?

if their reaction is typical, then it seems it works very well. they seemed very surprised at all the things komodo has and that it actually works

@jl777c show them trading logs on binance. They are not too strict on this yet. Mainly cos they still dont know what they are doing

[17-Jul-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but last i checked, you cant prove a negative. was that solved and nobody told me?

[17-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Btw is there any place to talk about assets like dex supernet crypto etc?

[17-Jul-19 05:12 PM] alen#3721
I didnt report anything to them yet as i dont trade much..just hodling. When time comes i will see..not sure about exactly how are they doing it

[17-Jul-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
@Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô you can ask

[17-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912

just a friendly reminder that everyone is responsible for reporting their own gains to relevant authorities. if you feel compelled to complain about the lack of automated govt surveillance on peer to peer systems please invest in libra. it should be released soon.

@artik123  question is how far do you need to track back for source of funds

[17-Jul-19 08:51 PM] artik123#2884
All the way back, unfortunately :)

[17-Jul-19 08:52 PM] artik123#2884
Last time I had to do it it was almost 20 pages long...

[17-Jul-19 08:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Only to the point you first received it though. You can‚Äôt be held accountable for where someone else you got it from got it.  Seems really as simple as just looking up your Dex address on the blockchain.

[17-Jul-19 09:00 PM] artik123#2884
To the point were I first got BTC from fiat exchange... I'm sure it can be done manually, but I'm not sure it is worth the hustle

[17-Jul-19 09:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
unfortunately for most of us in the us the only option is to send in what you got and hope for the best. no one knows how much of a hard on the irs has for crypto right now but it seems possible that coinbase is feeding them info now.

[17-Jul-19 09:05 PM] dan.#2473
capital gains for stocks etc went years  as the same. voluntary. i wouldnt worry about it

[17-Jul-19 09:06 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
@artik123 I've used website bitcoin.tax for the last few years.  It doesn't cost much and it processes all the transactions text or csv files, if you have a lot of trades its pretty easy to use.  I figure do my best to report so I don't end up in jail

[17-Jul-19 09:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not even sure how one classifies ‚Äúgains‚Äù when exchange between two altcoins especially ones with no market

[17-Jul-19 09:08 PM] artik123#2884
I do use a company that does it, but they need me to feed them with the reports that I export from exchanges

[17-Jul-19 09:08 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
the website i use is less than $50 I think, lots of options in how you process the transactions too

[17-Jul-19 09:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
the onus is on the citizen. overpay and dont expect anything  back. I've gotten $3 refund checks before.

[17-Jul-19 09:09 PM] dan.#2473
all these regulataors worried about money transmitters and transparent cryptos... they need to worry about DEX and private coins

[17-Jul-19 09:10 PM] dan.#2473
theyre so behind the balls

[17-Jul-19 09:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
they dont really care about anything but getting money from you. It's cheaper and easier for them to just cash your check and focus on non filers

[17-Jul-19 09:16 PM] artik123#2884
In my opinion they do it to the ones that they can  handle... they are going to regulate libra to death

[17-Jul-19 09:17 PM] dan.#2473
presumably they do, but I haven't heard them specifically talk about them

[17-Jul-19 09:19 PM] dan.#2473
if you follow the logic, spending trillions on `homeland security`, coupled with the ruckus theyre currently making... theyre screwed when it comes to privacy coins and dexs

[17-Jul-19 09:19 PM] artik123#2884
That kind of monopoly is not going to be taken from them that easily be sure of that

[17-Jul-19 09:19 PM] artik123#2884
Libra is a real threat

[17-Jul-19 09:21 PM] dan.#2473
i truly think its not discussed because its not on the minds, not that they cant do anything

[17-Jul-19 09:21 PM] dan.#2473
