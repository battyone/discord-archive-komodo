[23-Jan-19 02:58 PM] PTYX#6840
Or it went dead

[23-Jan-19 02:58 PM] Tek#5253
people r still shilling it tho

[23-Jan-19 02:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Privacy coin that requires an ip or email and both parties to be online or something sounds great .....

observations about GRIN: (from someone else)
ricToday at 21:34
A few observations I had while implementing this:

By default they want you to essentially pay to IP addresses. This was stupid when Satoshi tried it 10 years ago, and it's stupid now. At the very least you should strongly encourage (ie. nearly force) people to give out public keys along with their IPs, since otherwise MITM attacks are trivial. Even then it sucks to require the recipient to run an open-to-the-Internet server at all. And for goodness' sake, don't use the broken/centralized HTTPS system; the Bitcoin Core devs have been going to a lot of trouble trying to remove that garbage from Core.

A better protocol for the copy/paste method is needed. For one, you shouldn't have to use intermediary files. I was annoyed when I did grin wallet send -m file -d - and it actually created a file called "-" instead of writing to stdout like it should.

grin needs to be much better at handling transactions that never continue beyond the first or second step in the three-way transaction process. They probably shouldn't even show up in the main transaction log.

Currently I think that there's no way for the recipient to get the modified slate after running receive the first time (eg. if it gets lost), which is nuts. And currently there appears to be no reasonable method for proving that you sent a transaction.
####
so if indeed it is pay to IP address... then it seems quite an adoption issue. how to people with dynamic IP use this? and indeed what about MITM attacks, or all the NAT home isp where the user might not even have an external ip address?

make of it what you will

_doesn't even give his IP to people that he knows can't do anything with it_

So, what happens if you're in the middle of a tx and your ISP changes your dynamic IP?

someone tipped me 2kmd then the bot went in maintenance

[23-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Tek#5253
i came back and all my tips were GONE

[23-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Tek#5253
gone!!!!!!

[23-Jan-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
GRIN has no address's.... so IP was the easiest way to do it... Hopefully they can do it another way

tru

[23-Jan-19 03:15 PM] Tek#5253
I do think we are near bottom for the crypto markets

[23-Jan-19 03:15 PM] Tek#5253
many alts already bottomed out in sat value

[23-Jan-19 03:15 PM] Tek#5253
could hav another 1k usd drop I guess

[23-Jan-19 03:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I also think sub 3k isnt coming, we have had plenty of time now in this range to break down further but it hasnt.

[23-Jan-19 03:16 PM] Tek#5253
the whole hash war has sped up the bottom coming

[23-Jan-19 03:16 PM] Tek#5253
if there wasn't the hash war and massive sellofs by csw and bitmain

[23-Jan-19 03:16 PM] Tek#5253
we'd take a year to go from 6k to 3k

[23-Jan-19 03:17 PM] Tek#5253
but now it took like what a week

[23-Jan-19 03:17 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I just dont think the current market is natural

[23-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Tek#5253
yeah

[23-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Tek#5253
they would have probably kept it propped up longer else

[23-Jan-19 03:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it seemed to sideways for days then drop then repeat and this has slowed now imo

[23-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Tek#5253
so we should be thankful to csw

[23-Jan-19 03:19 PM] Tek#5253
he really helped us dumping the price fast instead of keeping it at 6k

[23-Jan-19 03:19 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Dunno it caused a shit show and emphasised how immature the markets are still imo

could also be too fragile to recover 游뱡

[23-Jan-19 03:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
But i am an optimist so its all good

[23-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Tek#5253
anyone holds chainlink

[23-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Tek#5253
its past its ath in sats

[23-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Tek#5253
wtf

[23-Jan-19 04:59 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
i think it is over hyped

[23-Jan-19 04:59 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
komodo much potentials

[23-Jan-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt chainlink just do oracles? Like put off chain data on chain?

[23-Jan-19 05:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I read so, oracles. Useful for Komodo too

[23-Jan-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810

`when new website?`
3rd Tuesday of the 2nd week that has 9 Sundays

[23-Jan-19 05:33 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Yes I mean providing the real world data to the Oracle CC

[23-Jan-19 05:38 PM] TonyL#3577
I have a tool to put files of any size to and from oracles

[23-Jan-19 05:39 PM] TonyL#3577
It's embed into oraclesTUI. So quite easy to provide real world data into the oraclesCC - just need some real applications ideas and implementations

trollface 

[23-Jan-19 05:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Like betting on football matches, you need someone to provide the real world results to the oracle. Chainlink provides the data via a network of multiple providers, so (they say) eliminating a single source as possible point of failure

@KomodoWorld Tech already allows to make thing like this. And there is a multiply publishers / datafee concept which seems to well suit such project needs.

[23-Jan-19 05:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes, I mean Chainlink is one of many options to feed the real world data, not an alternative to Oracle CC that makes use of the data

[23-Jan-19 05:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Not sure how their method makes the data especially reliable, I haven't looked at details

[23-Jan-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
OraclesCC actual purpose is to store offchain data onchain. And we already have an API (RPC calls)
By brief review of their whitepaper they making quite same thing (it even have same naming - Oracle SC)

[23-Jan-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
again, an entire blockchain project that has just one small part of komodo

[23-Jan-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Imo beside of huge technical differences (because Ethereum isn't UTXO chain) main difference is that they turned single smart contract into the project

[23-Jan-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
With separate landing and etc
