Well then when the price of ETH, has a huge retrace, there would be a panic or a crash

[18-Oct-19 09:10 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Bc you must save your funds, by committing more ETH

[18-Oct-19 09:10 PM] Privatoshi#9487
This is borrowing

[18-Oct-19 09:10 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Lending, although different, is tied to borrowing

[18-Oct-19 09:10 PM] dan.#2473
what im saying is, if joe smo has 20k in his bank account, he might be under the impression tether is just as good as USD and get 8-10 percent interest instead of 0.01 - 1.5.

[18-Oct-19 09:11 PM] Privatoshi#9487
What about when Tether drops to 0.92 cents?

[18-Oct-19 09:11 PM] Privatoshi#9487
A stable coin is only stable at $1, until it isnt

[18-Oct-19 09:11 PM] Privatoshi#9487
There are 0 guarantees

[18-Oct-19 09:12 PM] Privatoshi#9487
They have a history of going to as low as, 92 cents or 93

[18-Oct-19 09:13 PM] dan.#2473
but the variance is so low, I think there will be people willing to wait a few days if they really need to convert back to USD. Would I? I dont think so but i do think people will chase 10 percent returns as the tether is mostly around a dollar

[18-Oct-19 09:13 PM] Privatoshi#9487
This is why I don't do stablecoin lending.
If you go ask someone from USDC or DAI, can u guarantee itll stay at $1, they say they can't guarantee that it will.

[18-Oct-19 09:14 PM] dan.#2473
i agree its not apples to apples. but i do think people go for it

[18-Oct-19 09:14 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I think so too

[18-Oct-19 09:14 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm not here for USD $1.. 
I am here for BTC

[18-Oct-19 09:15 PM] Privatoshi#9487
So I don't lend

[18-Oct-19 09:15 PM] dan.#2473
idk. I just think its going to be tantalizing for many, albeit more risky than holding USD in a bank account

[18-Oct-19 09:16 PM] dan.#2473
and then you have the other coin part of this (non stable coins), and now they can get returns on that too

[18-Oct-19 09:16 PM] dan.#2473
people that trust entities with their keys anyways

[18-Oct-19 09:16 PM] Privatoshi#9487
It already accounts for several hundred millions of dollars. Probably more.

[18-Oct-19 09:16 PM] Privatoshi#9487
How will that start a crypto bull run?

[18-Oct-19 09:17 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Stablecoins are by definition cryptocurrencies.  I see them as a means to exchange from fiat to crypto

[18-Oct-19 09:17 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Why wouldn't they just stay with their 10% apr?

[18-Oct-19 09:19 PM] dan.#2473
oh. I see what youre asking- I am proposing at that point, being in stablecoins, it will erase some friction to get into non stable cryptos. Furthermore, lets say tether or some other entity bellies up after people are earning 10 percent for years. What do they do to save their skin? Buy Bitcoin (or other crypto).

[18-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Cosmos staking percentage is 13 percent.
It's a top 20 project. What is the difference between staking and lending?

[18-Oct-19 09:20 PM] dan.#2473
that the stablecoins are backed by USD, the worlds current reserve currency

[18-Oct-19 09:21 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Both lose value every second

[18-Oct-19 09:21 PM] dan.#2473
I am not too sure what we're really disagreeing on to be honest üòÇ

[18-Oct-19 09:21 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Lending will not initiate a bull run

[18-Oct-19 09:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
That removes money

[18-Oct-19 09:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
We need all of this money plus new monies for a bull run.

[18-Oct-19 09:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
And adoption

[18-Oct-19 09:23 PM] dan.#2473
But.. new money would come in. I am telling you, people will shit their pants if they can get 10 percent return on their USD- thats how they are going to look at it.

[18-Oct-19 09:23 PM] Privatoshi#9487
The next btc halving is the closest event we have listed, that could initiate a bull run

[18-Oct-19 09:23 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Only 3M BTC left to mine

[18-Oct-19 09:24 PM] dan.#2473
My buddy does P2P lending and gets 6 percent return, and sometimes deals with delinquent loans. He is interested in stablecoin interest

[18-Oct-19 09:25 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I told all of my family about stablecoin lending. And when they asked, if it guaranteed to always remain one dollar and I said no, they replied, "So it's an unstable coin"

[18-Oct-19 09:25 PM] dan.#2473
i agree its not apples to apples, but i also think not everyone is as smart as your fam lol

[18-Oct-19 09:25 PM] dan.#2473
or they will look at the stablecoin charts and say meh good enough

[18-Oct-19 09:26 PM] Privatoshi#9487
And they said, my dollar bill will always be a dollar bill. A 10% gain on my Roth IRA, is fully backed by the dollars I invest and I recieve.

[18-Oct-19 09:26 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Inflation, you must always know will be about 2% a year, on average

[18-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Why not buy Komodo?  :)

[18-Oct-19 09:28 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Nice little increase over past few days

[18-Oct-19 09:28 PM] dan.#2473
we'll see i guess what happens. i do notice an increase in this sort of activity in crypto as of late. hell, CMC came out with that interest rankings

[18-Oct-19 09:29 PM] dan.#2473
oh i do

[18-Oct-19 09:31 PM] Privatoshi#9487
CMC is not a resource I'd use tbh

[18-Oct-19 09:31 PM] Privatoshi#9487
It is biased.

A resource that is for finding cryptocurrencies and their prices, and information shouldn't be selective or exclude projects

[18-Oct-19 09:32 PM] dan.#2473
yeah it is, but its extremely popular even with mainstream

[18-Oct-19 09:32 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm not a mainstream type of guy. I am more of, use the best whatever that is available

Tether dropping to 0.92$ was cause all major whales exited their positions back into stable coins when btc peaked on the top of the previous bull run

[19-Oct-19 11:45 AM] üõ°bstr156#5540
I'm interested to see how commodity-based stablecoins eventually fit in the trading dynamic, once some are established, recognized, and have a physical delivery component. Seems to be plenty of room for them given the shortcomings and questionability of existing fiat counterparts.

[19-Oct-19 05:08 PM] tolken#2655
@üõ°bstr156 yea, like how it opens up the ability to leverage commodity backed loans, considerably easier than without crypto.

[19-Oct-19 05:24 PM] farl#9964
Are people trading JUMBLR?

[19-Oct-19 05:27 PM] jspook16#3059
you looking to get rid of some or get ?

Get rid of

What is JUMBLRs purpose now that zaddrs no longer exist and ARRR is considerably better for privacy?

[19-Oct-19 06:55 PM] hastrup#8742
They got 15% for dex

[19-Oct-19 06:55 PM] bishop#9773
so why not own DEX

[19-Oct-19 06:56 PM] bishop#9773
it just seems like it no longer has a place absent the very small sharing from dex

Jumblr is done, but jl777 hinted at repurposing the tokens, maybe.

Too bad, I lost a lot of sleep trying to get my jumblr tokens back in the day üòõ

Yeah same here. What's the going rate for jumblr

[19-Oct-19 10:40 PM] tolken#2655
Jl777 doesn‚Äôt like letting people down, so he‚Äôll probably do something cool with them one of these days.

I offer 0.8 KMD per JUMBLR

[20-Oct-19 03:01 AM] richardt#2807
None of it really has a purpose unless there are revshares being paid out.  Has only happened once in about 5 years now, I think?

[20-Oct-19 03:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Once so far

[20-Oct-19 04:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
The usability now is about 10,000x better than it ever was for normies. I wouldn't count out the potential for revshares in the future

[20-Oct-19 06:15 AM] richardt#2807
Yes, we've already waited this long.  What's another 5 years? üòÑ

[20-Oct-19 06:29 AM] hastrup#8742
@CHMEX I want that price to. I can offer 1 each for yours then you can Arbitrage üòâ

I'm interested in all except for dex ppl want way to much for that :)

[20-Oct-19 08:29 AM] Oszy#5734
what's too much? it gets 50% of the dexfees makes it the most worthy of all üòõ

[20-Oct-19 08:31 AM] hastrup#8742
Above 20 is to much for me anyway

[20-Oct-19 09:20 AM] Markus#5464
It all depends on how big the adoption for MM2 going to be, obviously the larger the more fee payouts. Nothing is quaranteed so its abit of a gamble to buy those assets for potential payouts in my opinion

[20-Oct-19 09:23 AM] Markus#5464
From what i can see ppl usually want ~40 kmd for each DEX, let's say u want to buy 1k DEX that would be 40k kmd, that would mean there need to be fees that exceed 2 mil usd for a payout of DEX shares to be happening (DEX get 50% of fees) and u would get a payout of 1000$ roughly with 1k DEX since supply is 1 mil

[20-Oct-19 09:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There will be much more usage than just trading.

[20-Oct-19 09:40 AM] coingirl87#6489
Tell us more about usage

[20-Oct-19 09:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
There is a simple calculation

[20-Oct-19 09:43 AM] coingirl87#6489
At the moment there is a daily volume of 54 billion usd in cryptomarket (only exchanges)

[20-Oct-19 09:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
With komodo dex after every 1.5 billion volume you get 1$ for 1 dex

[20-Oct-19 09:46 AM] coingirl87#6489
Lets assume that dex has a amount of 10 % of daily volume than over kmd dex we will see a daily volume of 5.4 billion
