usually one guy controlling big supply isn't good for a coin. It's good if you want PnD schemes

1 whale is meaningless in the entirety of the landscape
and if I'm wrong about that, then it means everything is doomed and hinges on the whims of a single person .... aka :complete fail

[26-May-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S.- @Tek unless you're personally "whalebro" you're a "pleb", since "everything" depends on him and his wealth (in your view)

[26-May-19 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
