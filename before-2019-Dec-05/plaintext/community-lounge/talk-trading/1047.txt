the operations are exchanges. some of which are apparently corrupt or are at least negligent in their responsibilities to their customers. the most recent binance kyc info leak shows just how much of a shitshow even the top volume exchanges can be. the hackers that got into binance wallets were likely pumping and dumping coins for weeks undetected. how well does TA work in that environment?

[08-Aug-19 05:13 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Regardless of other reasons, we have seen that KMD‚Äôs ranking is declining, this is the truth.

[08-Aug-19 05:13 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Means that users will continue to lose

[08-Aug-19 05:14 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
50 to 70

[08-Aug-19 05:15 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
is the hacker selling the kmd?

[08-Aug-19 05:16 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
For the problem of falling rankings, I think the team should make positive countermeasures and responses.

[08-Aug-19 05:16 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Instead of waiting

[08-Aug-19 05:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
any suggestions are welcome

[08-Aug-19 05:18 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@actionslacks 1. Find at least one marketing god 2 Conduct appropriate activities at the exchange to increase influence

[08-Aug-19 05:19 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
The market environment is not good, we do not deny it, but maybe it is the best opportunity for KMD to surpass other altcoins

[08-Aug-19 05:19 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I believe that if KMD has a good market performance, it can even exceed ETH.

[08-Aug-19 05:22 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
For example, the apps we use in China have daily market transactions, gains, and declines. Many people are paying attention. If KMD stays in the top 5 in the current harsh environment, there will be a large number of Chinese investment users joining.

[08-Aug-19 05:22 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I believe that at that time will also promote the success of DEX.

[08-Aug-19 05:23 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
After all, DEX requires a large number of users to use it to succeed.

[08-Aug-19 05:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
marketcap is one thing. to exceed eth you would need to have a better alternative. I think that is the goal with antara. but funds are finite. there is no premine or dev rewards to pull marketing funds from. i think a fast and easy to use mobile dex with no kyc will have users beating a path to it's door.

[08-Aug-19 05:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
there is zero competition in the market right now.

[08-Aug-19 05:27 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
So we need a god of marketing, don‚Äôt need big money.

[08-Aug-19 05:28 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Just walk on the right path.

[08-Aug-19 05:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
we must find god

[08-Aug-19 05:28 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Need to let the team see what we said

[08-Aug-19 05:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
maybe the marketing god is reading this right now.

[08-Aug-19 05:29 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
But still need the team to accept our advice

[08-Aug-19 05:30 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
The best way is to design a simple viral marketing applet that is simple

[08-Aug-19 05:31 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
If the team needs it, everyone can come up with their own ideas and designs.

[08-Aug-19 05:32 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Development difficulty is much smaller than DEX development technology

[08-Aug-19 05:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
well it's an open project. if you want to help them I'm sure the team would be glad to accept it. there is a fund set up for funding kmd meetups. you could plan  a  local meetup and spread the word.

[08-Aug-19 05:34 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I know this gathering, but I guess very few people are involved in this. Because marketing is just an aid, at least few people in China are interested.

[08-Aug-19 05:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
dextesting seems to be going well. once that launches in wild there would be an opportunity to introduce the tech to everyone you know.

[08-Aug-19 05:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
i believe that app will go viral when released

[08-Aug-19 05:35 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
In our marketing world, there is a saying called: eyeball effect

[08-Aug-19 05:36 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Before you introduce a project, you can attract enough basic people to pay attention.

[08-Aug-19 05:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
well tron is a good example of all marketing and much less tech. is it higher on cmc? yes. will it be around in 5 years. I can assure you it will not be. cmc is not the end all be all of project worth. but you're right. most people only care about price. to those people I say. buy btc. dont buy tron.  the revolution will not be televised.

@actionslacks TRON is a garbage coin, but there is a god of marketing.

[08-Aug-19 06:01 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
The fact that   don't need too much money, the key is whether the team is going to do it.

[08-Aug-19 06:02 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
As long as the market value is in the front, the price does not matter. We need to attract more attention

[08-Aug-19 07:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@weldon.gull5 then find this god or be them

[08-Aug-19 07:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I want a god of programming that will work for $1/hour and never write anything wrong

[08-Aug-19 07:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Actually i want 10 of them

[08-Aug-19 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That will be $10/hour and we can build a bitcoin/eth/eos hybrid in 2 weeks

[08-Aug-19 07:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You do see how ridiculous that sounds right?

[08-Aug-19 07:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You are saying there is some mysterious marketing guru that will work for free and he will be located if only the marketing team got off their ass and called 1800marketing on their phones and be put straight through to this person. Instead of making millions a year they will work for free because they will fall in love with KMD

[08-Aug-19 07:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and we will all be rich and live with 7 hot girlfriends that dont complain

[08-Aug-19 07:16 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I mean, real marketing won't cost a lot.

[08-Aug-19 07:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Like what? What is real marketing?

[08-Aug-19 07:16 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
If my suggestion offends the team, I shut up and disappear

[08-Aug-19 07:17 AM] coingirl87#6489
Komodo need no marketing

[08-Aug-19 07:17 AM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd has good marketing

[08-Aug-19 07:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You are saying something we all would like to have happen. What is your suggestion to do that?

[08-Aug-19 07:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If they do marketing and it doesnt pump the price, did they do good marketing?

[08-Aug-19 07:18 AM] coingirl87#6489
From top 100 coins kmd is on place 6 of loosers...so 5 are more bad then us

[08-Aug-19 07:18 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats a good marketing

[08-Aug-19 07:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I can sit here all day and say why doesnt the team just code better so the price go up

[08-Aug-19 07:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
or why doesnt the team code faster

[08-Aug-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But HOW can they do that

[08-Aug-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sure you can tell them marketing doesnt have to be expensive, HOWWWWWWWW do you want them to do that? If you have no suggestions on how, that does not help them in any way.

[08-Aug-19 07:19 AM] coingirl87#6489
I never say that devs should be faster

[08-Aug-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That was a example

[08-Aug-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So what is your suggestion to do better marketing?

[08-Aug-19 07:20 AM] coingirl87#6489
I like the work of devs

[08-Aug-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is a question for all the people complaining

[08-Aug-19 07:20 AM] coingirl87#6489
I like theire ideas and improvements

[08-Aug-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So how should they market KMD?

[08-Aug-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Word of mouth has been shown to be more effective than anything else.

[08-Aug-19 07:20 AM] coingirl87#6489
What i dont like is our external representation

[08-Aug-19 07:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What is your suggestion?

[08-Aug-19 07:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am being serious, if you have a good idea to market KMD i am pretty sure the marketing would LOVE to hear it.

[08-Aug-19 07:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But saying, do marketing or marketing is shit, does not help at all, especially when everyone just sits here complaining lol.

[08-Aug-19 07:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
This external representation effects performance

[08-Aug-19 07:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You mean at conferences?

[08-Aug-19 07:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
And performance in last 7 days say that from all 100 top coins 93 have better performance

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...conferences

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Can you control the market?

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] coingirl87#6489
Paid article

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Are you willing to help fund those efforts?

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] coingirl87#6489
Aggressive marketing

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Can the team count on you to contribute?

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] coingirl87#6489
Lol....komodo has enough efforts

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The funds are to hire devs to get shit done

[08-Aug-19 07:23 AM] coingirl87#6489
But problem is that price is falling

[08-Aug-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Do you have 2M to spend on a pornhub partnership?

[08-Aug-19 07:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
That means funds shrink and shrink

[08-Aug-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So what? How does it help KMD to spend all the BTC and have KMD left over, which they need to sell to fund devs

[08-Aug-19 07:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
Marketing effects are higher prices

[08-Aug-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
How can you know?

[08-Aug-19 07:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
Higher prices means more funds for marketing

[08-Aug-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
How much did verge make from the $2m partnership?

[08-Aug-19 07:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
More marketing needs again higher prices

[08-Aug-19 07:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats the wheel of marketing

[08-Aug-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you can give me assurances if i spend $1M on marketing i will get $2M i am sure the team would do it

[08-Aug-19 07:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats how its work

[08-Aug-19 07:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
Not waiting until end of wirld is near

[08-Aug-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is how someone that has no idea thinks it works

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] coingirl87#6489
But thats my opinion

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@coingirl87 I don‚Äôt think it makes any sense to discuss it. They don‚Äôt respect the market.

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Exactly üòÉ

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
LOL....

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...its sad

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
And are not willing to listen to any different opinions.

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
But we have different opinions, and in exchange for accusations
