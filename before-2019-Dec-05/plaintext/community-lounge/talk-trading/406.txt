you serious? xD

[10-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Lanii#8302
you called the entire crypto market bubble

[10-Feb-19 08:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
sounds like a blast sifting through years of your irritated diatribes

[10-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Lanii#8302
and hence market agrees with you

[10-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Lanii#8302
if market agreed with you, your alts would be way better off then btc

[10-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Lanii#8302
while btc lost around 80% of its value alts normally lost 90-96%

[10-Feb-19 08:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
but thats just because people are stupid and Pink Pony is smart

[10-Feb-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you called the entire crypto market bubble`
no, BTC being flat @ 3200-3600

[10-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Lanii#8302
I have no interest in going through slack

[10-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Lanii#8302
and search for your messages tbh

[10-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Lanii#8302
But its very typical to make 15 calls

[10-Feb-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
me either or I would have linked to it :p

[10-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Lanii#8302
and then say "I was right"

[10-Feb-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
I do remember him consistently saying BTC had no reason to be above $4500

[10-Feb-19 08:57 PM] Lanii#8302
And if (when) we get above 4.5k, what happens then?

[10-Feb-19 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on another parabolic? another bubble burst

[10-Feb-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
he was saying it from the $10K and above period

[10-Feb-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and all the way down

[10-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Lanii#8302
Ye, but did he short it?

[10-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Lanii#8302
You literaly just had to take a look at previous bubbles

[10-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Lanii#8302
and make a projection on 80 - 85% drop from peak

[10-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Lanii#8302
And you would be right

[10-Feb-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all BTC parabolics are based on unicorns farting rainbows and happy, happy feel goods and nothing more

[10-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Lanii#8302
There are a lot of people who called for any kind of lvls but question is if they actually put any skin in it

[10-Feb-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I just am recalling what was posted. not about whatever level of skin you are needing

[10-Feb-19 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Had I the liquidity I would have, sadly I'm a poor bastid and all my fundage went into mining

[10-Feb-19 09:01 PM] Lanii#8302
Aight

[10-Feb-19 09:01 PM] Lanii#8302
don't forget this James so you can give me some creds in few years

[10-Feb-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
sure, if you keep repeating it throughout the bear market, really you should have started when we went below 10k

[10-Feb-19 09:14 PM] Lanii#8302
Can I ask what you think about btc?

[10-Feb-19 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it is what it is

[10-Feb-19 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
like MS-DOS will be around a lot longer than it should

[10-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Lanii#8302
But one day it will die?

[10-Feb-19 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🙏🏽

[10-Feb-19 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
well, I think MS-DOS still lives in some places

Only time will tell

[10-Feb-19 09:25 PM] Lanii#8302

Funny when people keep on posting the same charts, it is not going to move the market lol. As long as there are no fundamental catalysts all we see here are pumps. Shit show as usual.

`Go buy you some Bitcoins wid it`

[11-Feb-19 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I realize that Bittrex isn't the "hotbed of activity", but I really expected the KMD/USD market to have a shit ton more activity than it has 😕

[11-Feb-19 12:30 PM] jorian#4555
who needs KMD?

[11-Feb-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everyone 🙂

[11-Feb-19 12:30 PM] jorian#4555
why

[11-Feb-19 12:31 PM] jorian#4555
i'm really not sure why anyone would need KMD.

[11-Feb-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't sure if @jorian is trolling or knows something he doesn't 🤔_

[11-Feb-19 12:33 PM] jorian#4555
i don't know anything you would learn something from 😛

[11-Feb-19 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
dPOW clients needs KMD

[11-Feb-19 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also people who want to play KMDICE and SUDOKU 😂

[11-Feb-19 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL
That's the only reason I can think of as to why you would say that you can't see why anyone would need something *that you are a part of* 😕

[11-Feb-19 12:38 PM] jorian#4555
my brain hurts, reading that sentence

[11-Feb-19 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my brain hurt writing it 😛

[11-Feb-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
KMD is the go-to asset/coin you need when wanting to use a service on the KMD platform

[11-Feb-19 12:41 PM] jorian#4555
that's a reason for wanting to buy it i guess

[11-Feb-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That's one aspect of it
Or the whole aspect if the idea is to make it a commodity instead of a currency

[11-Feb-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
coming up with ways to force people to use something doesnt work very well in open source if it costs them more money. they need to want to do it. KMD not forcing monetization for things, but providing valuable tech, makes it the center of a growing ecosystem. Maybe some projects convert 1% to KMD or 10% as a conduit. maybe some are 0%, others are 100%. There is no set rules. Lets assume 10% of the overall ecosystem volume goes through KMD, which is probably not off by more than an order of magnitude. So KMD is not needed for anything other than 5% per year, but yet as all these other projects start arising, KMD benefits. It is like when barterDEX was active. it didnt force people to use KMD, yet 80% or so did

🆒 

[11-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
5% rewards aint too bad either

[11-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Once chainlizard and other services are up and running more demand for kmd will occurr as more will want to notarize to kmd I presume

[11-Feb-19 01:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

✅ 

[11-Feb-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, dPoW requires KMD directly

[11-Feb-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but really, it is about people wanting KMD and not forcing them to use it. ETH was doing fantastic with all the gas costs, right?

[11-Feb-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
except everybody was doing everything they could to no pay the crazy gas fees

[11-Feb-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
when the monetization becomes the main problem, well, it seems there is something very wrong with that approach that makes it not sustainable in the long run

[11-Feb-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and by long run, I dont mean 3 months

[11-Feb-19 01:05 PM] jorian#4555
people have paid for whatsapp

[11-Feb-19 01:07 PM] jorian#4555
i never paid 😛

[11-Feb-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
thats the other thing, the time to add monetization is when you have hundreds of millions of users, not when it is thousands

[11-Feb-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so for all that want KMD to have aggressive monetization you will need to wait a bit

But I have time

[11-Feb-19 01:36 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
My point of view is that Komodo plans to become a business system... So KMD is something like holding its shares.. Never sell 100% of your komodos
