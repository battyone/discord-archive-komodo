Using TradingView, I heard that we have the alts top 125 index. I wonder if it makes sense to display kmd next to this chart (maybe put on a similar scale bc kmd graph would bd tiny next to top 125 chart)

$ALTS $Crypto - Something Midly interesting, RSI div and strength if impulsion to the upside break the consolidation.

Might just be a correction if RSI <50.
Will reevaluate if crossing RSI > 50 (circled)

1.618 fib retracement done for kmd as expected, bounce from here or keep on getting rekt we will see

[01-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I guess this kind of talk is expected

[01-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Markus#5464
maybe double bottom?

[01-Aug-19 07:37 PM] Caglio#3337
Under 10k now

[01-Aug-19 07:37 PM] dan.#2473
no one knows if kmd lowers past 9500, i can see a big drop, and then i imagine itd take a very long time. then again it can pop- fast

[01-Aug-19 07:37 PM] Caglio#3337
Lets hit that 8k so we can get to 5k and fill our bags

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dan.#2473
8k -> 5k would take a long ass time i think

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
And just a month ago, someone said, we are not getting under 21 k ever again

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
hahaahhaha

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dan.#2473
i cant see 5k happening any time soon

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Me neither honestly, but I can see steady drop again

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dan.#2473
well, yeah i dont know shit but, just the law numbers i think

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Neko#5830
almost never been this low

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dan.#2473
itll have to slow down

[01-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean, slowly but surely we are going down

[01-Aug-19 07:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Still we are not at half a buck like we were few months ago

[01-Aug-19 07:39 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Yup, only time we had a really nice rise, was an agama hack

[01-Aug-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
That was actually the best marketing move we ever had

[01-Aug-19 07:42 PM] dan.#2473
lol

[01-Aug-19 07:43 PM] dan.#2473

[01-Aug-19 07:44 PM] dan.#2473

[01-Aug-19 07:45 PM] dan.#2473

[01-Aug-19 07:51 PM] dan.#2473
wasnt everyone wishing there would be* a decoupling from btc? well, now its starting

[01-Aug-19 07:52 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Literally fell as a rock when btc mooned , where do you see a decoupling sir

[01-Aug-19 07:53 PM] dan.#2473
for the most part, they followed it up and down. seems maybe theres an inverse correlation now with a handful of alts doing their own thing every other day

too much? lol

[01-Aug-19 08:05 PM] dan.#2473
actually a pretty catchy redo of that older song

[01-Aug-19 08:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Guys if you used this much time and energy to promote KMD you might actually increase the price. Why not join the socials and do what you can?

[01-Aug-19 08:14 PM] Caglio#3337
Because I am a little bitch and I want to be paid for my efforts ( :

[01-Aug-19 08:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont give me this BS that you dont get paid to do it like the marketing team, take ownership over your investment decisions. So if you see the market team as failing, SELL NOW before it drops further. If you believe in KMD, go out and promote.

Dont even get me started with that

[01-Aug-19 08:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You can't believe in KMD and bitch a moan whilst doing nothing to stop that
