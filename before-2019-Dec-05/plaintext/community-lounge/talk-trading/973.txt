His idea of fair value seems par for the course when the only thing you have left is hype.

@Tek lol.. you're speaking 4Chan

[27-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
i am working the wage again

[27-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
so i can continue dump all my savings in crypto

[27-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
The wage is the wage

[27-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
i don't even need a car to get to my new job

[27-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
so i can really dump everything in

[27-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
If u aren't the one footing the bills and running the show, ur wage

[27-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Over 90 percent of the world is wage bro

[27-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
250k KMD would be nice

[27-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Tek#5253
I know, 90% are wage slaves. the difference is with cryptos you can get out of the wage. wage money ( dollars and euro ) are designed to keep you waging forever.

[27-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Tek#5253
so i tend to not save any euros or dollars at all if i don't have to

[27-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
No, the way you live is designed to keep you waging

[27-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Tek#5253
also, but the money a wager saves also.

[27-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Can be significant

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
I'm a minimalist

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
I don't have excess

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
No credit cards

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253
lets say you wage for 50k over 10 years of waging. Great, but now you can only buy 30k worth of goods for that 50k...

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253
if you understand

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253
minimalist is nice

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253
I tried sleeping on the floor a few times

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
If u wage $50k in a year, u keep about $36k

[27-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
U pay in 20-25% tax

[27-Jul-19 09:10 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
That's $3k a month

[27-Jul-19 09:10 AM] Tek#5253
i live in socialist europe. building 50k of savings over 10 years is a great accomplishment here

[27-Jul-19 09:10 AM] Tek#5253
for the average wager

[27-Jul-19 09:10 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
That's a great accomplishment anywhere

[27-Jul-19 09:10 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Don't listen to the noise

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
That's a significant amount of money

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
its not significant

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Do u have it?

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
yes

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
And u really think it's not significant?

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
it isn't, i can't buy a house.

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
house + land

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
with it

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
i can't buy anything of significance with it

[27-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
You could pay for 40% of a home in the US in certain cities

[27-Jul-19 09:12 AM] Tek#5253
what I can do now is,

[27-Jul-19 09:12 AM] Tek#5253
