'pegged' is just a word, like 'proxy'... means it is worth the same as the other thing because I said so üòÉ

[18-Jun-19 10:27 AM] Markus#5464
ye i know

[18-Jun-19 10:27 AM] jansako#3330
not that it does not work, of course... used them ad nauseam on Waves when I was still hanging out there

[18-Jun-19 10:28 AM] jansako#3330
question is why is it news? I thought that was always what they were going to do? Or the fact that they are starting?

[18-Jun-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it is what i did with MGW, though that had multisig, back in 2014

[18-Jun-19 10:29 AM] jansako#3330
indeed... remember sending BTC from NXT blockchain üòÉ

[18-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Markus#5464
@jl777c Whats ur opinion regarding FAFT?  How will it affect crypto?

[18-Jun-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems users with their own wallets wont be affected too much. users who use hosted wallets and exchanges will have every transactions known by all countries

[18-Jun-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it will create a demand for atomic swaps

[18-Jun-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and a large market for stolen KYC data

[18-Jun-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
all this likely violates the GPDR

[18-Jun-19 10:40 AM] Markus#5464
Lets say u have 10k u wanna withdraw for example, would withdrawing less then 1k at a time bypass it?

[18-Jun-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea

[18-Jun-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is 10k/day, or 10k/mo or 10k lifetime limits. who knows, they are just global guidelines to be interpreted by each of the 200 countries independently

[18-Jun-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
a total mess i think

[18-Jun-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the facebook coin is created to gather a lot of financial data, this FATF gets more, they want to basically deanonymize all crypto transactions

[18-Jun-19 10:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Markus  no,  look up suspicious activity reports

[18-Jun-19 10:43 AM] Markus#5464
So this way they could collect data to prevent ppl from not paying taxes on crypto aswell?

[18-Jun-19 10:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[18-Jun-19 10:44 AM] Markus#5464
Well whales will have a hard time for sure

[18-Jun-19 10:44 AM] Markus#5464
specially those who been in crypto since many years and never paid taxes

[18-Jun-19 10:47 AM] jansako#3330
nah, split your stash into multiple addresses in your own wallet & then just declare whatever you move when you need it

[18-Jun-19 10:47 AM] jansako#3330
call it 'consulting fee'

[18-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
binance is still suspended

[18-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
hitbtc is a scam

[18-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
many people got their ID / crypto stolen / frozen

[18-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
I actually almost got scammed there

[18-Jun-19 10:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You should have asked when will Binance be open, not exchanges .   And the answer to that is when they have updated and decide to open.

[18-Jun-19 10:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

We are now officially in the "bargaining" stage of the 5 stages of grief for traditional financial services. 

In order to bargain, the financial industry made a deal with the devil and got a fake blockchain in return.

fake blockchain Libra

[18-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Malti#3948
I don't see the fuss. It's just a diversification into bank activities (but then with a "blockchain") the extra data he'll receive is the one that banks already have and are to be shared anyway according to the PSD2 law

[18-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Malti#3948
Banks are more in trouble than Bitcoin imo

[18-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Malti#3948
if I have to pay my elextricity bill and I can do it with Libra (which I suppose will be easier than using my banking app) I don't see no reason not to do it. E.G i already switched from a 'classic bank' in Belgium to a Challenger bank 'revolut' for the ease of use

the speed and degree to which rules are bent and created to get this monster walking and talking will be a good indicator of how captured this whole system really is. maybe it will serve as a wake up call to some.
