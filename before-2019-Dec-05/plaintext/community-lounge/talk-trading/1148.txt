UPDATE: The NY Fed is planning to inject another $75 billion into the financial system on Friday (tomorrow).

That will be more than $275 billion total in four days this week.

Add in the two recent rate cuts & you could argue that the Fed is fighting the start of a recess...

$800B printed out of thin air during 2008 crisis. 

$200B printed in just the last 3 days to give banks liquidity during the "best" economy, "best" job market, and "best" stock market. 

I'll give you one guess where the next actual crisis leads. 

Buy #bitcoin.

wouldn't agree to going all in in crypto, if they are not earning fiat monthly to pay for living expenses.
once a person is assure their expenses will be fine to manage for N months or N years with existing fiat money or a pool of money, the rest of it they can definitely put in cryptocurrency. going all in in cryptocurrency at any point of it's prices is dangerous thing financially. Has to be well informed decision to make.

What is best exchange for buy komodo?

[20-Sep-19 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
until the rest of the world catches up on accepting cryptocurrency for everyday things, it has to be a well analysed decision to going all in in cryptocurrency with no fiat in hand.

sry for my double panda face but the fees at bitpanda are higher and less traidingpairs and u need kyc

[20-Sep-19 03:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[20-Sep-19 03:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you want cheap SEPA transfer to Kraken => btc to binance is probably best

[20-Sep-19 03:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
