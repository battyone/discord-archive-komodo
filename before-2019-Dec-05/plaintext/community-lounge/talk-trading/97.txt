he missed amazon and google I garuntee you he misses bitcoin cash

[14-Aug-18 04:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
You heard it here fiorst.

[14-Aug-18 04:54 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I honestly hope he loses everything in this next crash he's the reason the last crash got bailed out... He basically forced the government to bail out the banks...

[14-Aug-18 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bitcoin cash is by no means the best or anything, but its already there with all infrustructure to handle mass use. Nothing else is going to take that from it any time soon.

I think it's more realistic for ETF route to play out. Because majority /tech noobs are not going to catch up in 2 years about how bitcoin works and dealing with cold wallet / hot wallet.  People will buy the ETF because it is easier to deal with. Unless somebody can make a really smooth way to buy and sell bitcoin. Even now a lot of people have no idea how tcp/ip works, dhcp etc

[14-Aug-18 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think this is about noobs and ppl

[14-Aug-18 04:55 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm long on komodo I think komodo's solution is superior

[14-Aug-18 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its about business bing able to transact internationally when fiat markets implode

[14-Aug-18 04:55 AM] BlackJesus#6161
but BCH's solution is now

[14-Aug-18 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the food of the world needs to be delivered etc... if fiat is in free fal, we need a new exchange medium... gold and silver cannot be move over boarders and oceans

[14-Aug-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least not easily

[14-Aug-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at a locla level, ppl wil likey barter or steal lol

[14-Aug-18 04:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
probably

[14-Aug-18 04:59 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If that did happen total global fiat currencies in free fall. I guarantee you BCH will fork  something like 300-500mb blocks lol

[14-Aug-18 04:59 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Core will lose their mind

[14-Aug-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly

[14-Aug-18 05:00 AM] BlackJesus#6161
but BCH will work

[14-Aug-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
After working on scaling test... its perfectly fine to run 1 even 2gb blocks on a single chain if youhave enough internet bandwidth on the servers runnign full nodes..

[14-Aug-18 05:00 AM] BlackJesus#6161
You honestly dont even need much bandwidtch just got to make a monster node

[14-Aug-18 05:01 AM] BlackJesus#6161
20TB hard drives in raid 10

[14-Aug-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
validating blocks, is single threaded I think

[14-Aug-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You would host the blockchain in a cloud storage

[14-Aug-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no other way about it

[14-Aug-18 05:01 AM] BlackJesus#6161
yea or that

[14-Aug-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its so cheap.. if your talking about the worlds finances running on it... you would have unlimited money

[14-Aug-18 05:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
and vendors would definitely host their own nodes. Global vendors specifically.

[14-Aug-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bitmain would have their own DC's

[14-Aug-18 05:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
wouldnt be just miners with full nodes.

[14-Aug-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as would things like Amazon etc who would disribute products

[14-Aug-18 05:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
You think amazon walmart macys mcdonalds burger king are going to rely on the miners to verify all transactions lol?

[14-Aug-18 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubtful... but what really needs to happen, is wallet deamon needs to be removed from `bitcoind`

[14-Aug-18 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you can have a full node with all blocks, with many many wallets on it

[14-Aug-18 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so macdonalds would have a few nodes... each store has a wallet connected to a node for example

[14-Aug-18 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
end users use SPV

[14-Aug-18 07:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
what was the point btc mining was inefficient?

[14-Aug-18 07:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Depends on your costs

[14-Aug-18 07:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
From asicminervalue ,  s9 is profitable at 10 cents and under so there is still some room ,  big farms get rates at like 2-4 cents

[14-Aug-18 07:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
This is market view we can call as “WTF Market”

[14-Aug-18 07:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Kmd already 99 cents

[14-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[14-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Whats up with that

[14-Aug-18 07:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I can't believe that kassu prediction came true,  hopefully his other one does too, 300 $ kmd by 2020

[14-Aug-18 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
What predictions?

[14-Aug-18 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[14-Aug-18 08:35 AM] Bittersweet#9376
In 3 months, it's end of the year panic time

Prepare for taxes

[14-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Taxes? 😂

[14-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
They pay us forward this time

[14-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
I congratulate anyone who made a big enough gain to worry about taxes this year

[14-Aug-18 08:36 AM] snowdamn#2414
taxes are not a factor when someone is entering

[14-Aug-18 08:37 AM] snowdamn#2414
so it will come down to whether it will be considered a good entry at these levels

[14-Aug-18 08:37 AM] snowdamn#2414
if not, will test lower levels

[14-Aug-18 08:38 AM] snowdamn#2414
😱

[14-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah, I only lost money trading

[14-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
My “gains” were notional as I never sold

[14-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[14-Aug-18 09:36 AM] Reel Em In#1495
why is 99% of Utrum purchased away from barter dex/hyper dex? thought they had a close relationship with kmd, would have thought sales would be directed/pushed towards barter dex?

[14-Aug-18 09:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They are free to choose which ever exchange they want as an independent blockchain.

Same here, bought 50% of my Holding at 4$, then 25% more at 3,1$ and the last 25% at 1,7$ ... Now i need to find a job before investing again ... =/

[14-Aug-18 10:36 AM] BlockTech#6895
Let's HODL until 2021 for me. Even if it reach 0,1$/kmd

[14-Aug-18 10:45 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Huge sell off everywhere.. after months of bear.. getting closer to desperation and capitulation. Hold fiat to buy soon..

[14-Aug-18 10:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Bought from $2 up to $20 and back down LOL. Never heard of the word sell 😂

"Crazy money raised in ICO, mostly in ETH, started to be sold on open market for USD. Just to cover developer costs, marketing, office rent and so on. In coming months a lot of projects will start running out of money and even tho big promises were made there will be little to no adoption of coins that were supposed to "disrupt multibillion industry". Market will consolidate and thereafter raise again. "
