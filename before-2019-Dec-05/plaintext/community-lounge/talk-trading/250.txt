Message for all seller : Prefer Hold my KMD!! :trollface: :yassinkomodo: :abusedsmily:

[25-Oct-18 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So this guy answers the inquiries about why he ignored KMD completely from coindesk article with a peace sign.... what a douche

Sounds like you guys attacked and harassed him and he snapped.

[25-Oct-18 01:40 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Didn't follow it, but if someone indeed said he did a shitpioece article, that already puts him into a defensive stance.

[25-Oct-18 01:41 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
It's not helpful to argument like this. Might as well make genie head of KMD marketing ^^

[25-Oct-18 01:44 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Got a link to the full discussion instead of a screenshot? I would like to check it out and see what happened.

@Jacobstoon @KomodoPlatform @einsteiniumcoin @geocold51 @forkwitch pretty tangential to this particular post and honestly that's not really the story I got from Einsteinium... but either way, not the point here

[25-Oct-18 01:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that's not the way to win someone over 😄

[25-Oct-18 01:55 PM] crumb#2550
the discussion was quite civil until he posted that peace sign

[25-Oct-18 01:56 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Okay, I relize doc M is the one flustered, brady seems pretty chill about it. Nah, the peace sign is fine, usually ppl read into their own emotions, rather than what was meant to be said.

[25-Oct-18 01:56 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I read it as peace out, as in "cheers", thanks. And this was after komdoworld got aggressive. Kinda sad to see thisthough, even though it's not an official channel

[25-Oct-18 01:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
'drop the mic' - peace out 😄

[25-Oct-18 01:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no one offended him

[25-Oct-18 01:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It can be seen as rude if that is what he meant

[25-Oct-18 01:58 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
He seems like he doesn't care at all , no more comments from him

[25-Oct-18 01:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the peace sign was a way to say: "talk to the hand, i wont hear it"

@BradyDale Any reason why you are not mentioning @KomodoPlatform dPoW solutions to mitigate 51% attacks on @einsteiniumcoin which prevented @geocold51 and @forkwitch from successfully attacking the chain?
Twitter

[25-Oct-18 01:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is nothing uncivil or disrespectful about what cryptoon said

[25-Oct-18 01:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he then says: https://twitter.com/Jacobstoon/status/1055134281599737856

[25-Oct-18 01:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which was a super rude way to answer because he actually acknowledges that he knew about kmd

[25-Oct-18 02:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he just says it was "tagential" as in.... no body cares i just ignored it.

[25-Oct-18 02:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then Komodoworld answers with disbelief about what he just said and linked proof

[25-Oct-18 02:00 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then he had it coming

[25-Oct-18 02:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then he drops the peace sign as in... fuck off

[25-Oct-18 02:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
after that... yeah... fuck him. He acknowledged that he is just blatantly ignoring and shillin his own bags.

[25-Oct-18 02:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but we are the rude ones... sure... perfect.

[25-Oct-18 02:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
poor kid... he got defensive when someone told him he was doing a shitpiece

[25-Oct-18 02:11 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
The very first post from @Cryptoon  is already rude and attacking. @siu - Chainmakers, such a memo wouldn't fly in a corporate environment. more tactful way might have been to point it out as an additional information, but any question starting with why goes deeper and sound aggressive, most humans can't deal with this unless trained and get emotional without knowing. I said I didn't follow the conversionsation so I didn't have full info as well. my initial reply was only on the screenshot without context.

[25-Oct-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
☮  = "peace out; I can't justify my fluff, so I'm not going to try any more"

[25-Oct-18 02:19 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
See, this is just you interpreting it, I am pretty sure if you were to sit in one room and discuss this, this would have been quite different.

[25-Oct-18 02:19 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Twitter and internet is not a good communication platform

[25-Oct-18 02:20 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Otherwise it's onesided you get only your own input rather then his as well.

[25-Oct-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The last bit was implied, not "interpreted"

[25-Oct-18 02:21 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
But you can't know that, Might as well be, he is busy with something and doesn't have time to deal with something on twitter. This reminds me of this: https://xkcd.com/386/

wow man... if you have such skills why you didnt tweet ?

[25-Oct-18 02:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think we need a "tacful message specialist" here

[25-Oct-18 02:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if asking about why komodo platform wasnt mentioned is being rude... im not sure what to say

[25-Oct-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sure... he doesnt have the drive to answer questions about an article he posts as his job

[25-Oct-18 02:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"excuse me sir, sorry for the unpoliteness of asking since i dont know you personally, but would you one day be interested on talking about Komodo over a cup of tea in a personal and candid environment where we both feel safe and comfortable"?

[25-Oct-18 02:25 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@siu - Chainmakers I wasn't aware we did this, I think I was sleeping when this happened

[25-Oct-18 02:25 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I would have helped you out though.

[25-Oct-18 02:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh well... so bad that we just asked about why he didnt mention kmd... would have been great to have an answer about why he ignored kmd.

[25-Oct-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But you can't know that, Might as well be, he is busy with something and doesn't have time to deal with something on twitter`
Except for the 25 posts he's made since then? 🙄

[25-Oct-18 02:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lol, yes, exactly... while this discussion was happening he was posting photos of wwf fighters that are using "crypto"

[25-Oct-18 02:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think we were pretty soft on him. I'm usually very very understanding of others point of view, but he wrote that this was 'tangential' and 'not the point' he showed a complete bias or sloppy research

yeah... "KMD was tangential... but do you know this other coin which i hold a bag of want to try in the future to prevent an 51%, take a look at them, here is a link! "

[25-Oct-18 02:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
come on man... there was no need to be polite to this scumbag

[25-Oct-18 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bpkdasbaum are you a fanboy or are you just trying to be even more of a contrarian than I am on my most annoying days?

[25-Oct-18 02:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
The days that end in Y?

[25-Oct-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, those

[25-Oct-18 02:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
The problem is usually the word "why". This is a word that attacks the being of a person, it triggers emotional responses from the  limbic parts of the brain, questions your core. If you don't know your communication partner well it's better to stay way from these types of questions and stay neutral. So what/when/who questions. This already set him up in a defensive position.

[25-Oct-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ffs go to #safespace

[25-Oct-18 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lets say it was not him... lets say it was editorialized.... at least he could have acted as if he knew nothing and say oh, cool, will look into it, thanks for pointing it out.

[25-Oct-18 02:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
That assumes him being a perfect balanced person though.

[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
It's easier to start with stuff you can control yourself.

[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
You never know how other people react.

[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Or what type of life they had, what type of education

[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
do you know that language is not about what is said, but about what is not said.... do you know what implying is?

[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
If you control your own speech, you got direct impact or at least more impact on where it leads you,

[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
right... please, illuminate me on how this would have worked positively for kmd.

[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Also it's easier to manipulate people ^^ the aspect i like the most

[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how this "conversation" would have been beneficial

[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`That assumes him being a perfect balanced person though.`
Oh bullshit, I'm about the most emotionally unhinged person on the interwebz (second only to @Hollowman9000), and "why" invokes a response, not some feked up nonsense about being "attacked"

[25-Oct-18 02:34 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
What was the original aim?

[25-Oct-18 02:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
actually cryptoon's post was very effective afaik.

[25-Oct-18 02:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it didnt give time to come up with a manipulative answer.

[25-Oct-18 02:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just straight up " hey... any reasons why this was not mentioned?"

[25-Oct-18 02:35 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
´right... please, illuminate me on how this would have worked positively for kmd.´ answer depends on what you wanted to accomplish

[25-Oct-18 02:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
His answer.... i didnt mention it because its "tangential" and also... EMC2 didnt mention anything about it"

[25-Oct-18 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so... implications of this post.... first... he didnt deny knowing about KMD

[25-Oct-18 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he knew

[25-Oct-18 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he just said "its unrelated", which we all know its not.

[25-Oct-18 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also, said, his supposed justifications of why he thought it was tnagential

[25-Oct-18 02:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"because EMC2 didint mention anything about this"

[25-Oct-18 02:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which we know also its false.

[25-Oct-18 02:37 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@siu - Chainmakers Actually sorry, I have to get back in 25 min to you about this.

[25-Oct-18 02:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so yeah... the resolution is what we wanted.... put them on the spot.

@bpkdasbaum  `Today at 9:37 AM
@siu Actually sorry, I have to get back in 25 min to you about this.`
And that's how he, being a "reporter", would have responded when "he is busy with something and doesn't have time to deal with something on twitter", not with ☮

[25-Oct-18 02:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
as a reporter (if a good one) his duty was to dig more about the questions being asked because you want to give the best story possible.

I should DM him and ask him about buying a KMD piece, see what he responds with

[25-Oct-18 02:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
His "it doesnt matter, i dont care", while actively shilling another coin in his story is perfect proof that he is not a journalist... he is a PR person.

[25-Oct-18 02:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
do it!

[25-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can see where he got his "standards" from though, given that he wrote an article tilted:
` The fake dicks are coming at UT-Austin`
in
`[The] Observer offers a sophisticated readership of metropolitan professionals an original take on the latest in news, culture, politics and luxury, bringing its irreverent sensibility to a national audience.`

[25-Oct-18 02:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

hey @bpkdasbaum I thought my first post was just asking a question, not really attacking

[25-Oct-18 03:10 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
kmd volume trippled last 3 days O_o

[25-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And then he just started denying the kmd existence and I didnt bother to even chime in anymore

[25-Oct-18 03:12 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Yeah, don't think it was your intention. Why questions are tricky in this regard in general. The moment you ask them, they start to question the very core of your being. Why did you do X, our brain autoamtically start going crazy on those thoughts without us realizing and triggers a fight or flight reflex in the limbic brain, worst case scenario one snaps back

[25-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe he knew exactly what he did and knew there was no defense

[25-Oct-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why did you do X, our brain autoamtically start going crazy on those thoughts without us realizing and triggers a fight or flight reflex in the limbic brain`

@Jaki have you tried not withdrawing full amount but leaving some for tx fee?

@Cryptoon yes I tried but no success.
