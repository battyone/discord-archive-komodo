Crypto shakeout, how many coins will fail ?

[03-Aug-18 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully most of them üòÑ

[03-Aug-18 04:35 AM] JimD#9272
ya, market is pretty crazy right now.  BTC goes up alts get burned, BTC goes down and alts get slaughtered

[03-Aug-18 04:36 AM] JimD#9272
KMD seems t have some pretty smart traders so the effects get amplified cause the've been getting burned for the past 6 months

[03-Aug-18 04:37 AM] JimD#9272
I just got into KMB so just no beginning to understand how the herd on this coin works

[03-Aug-18 04:37 AM] JimD#9272

[03-Aug-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha, yeah gave up trading as soon as bull ended... Wasn;t even good at it when the market was super exponential gain, over traded.

[03-Aug-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Aug-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the more work we do, the more tech we creat the price just dumps more and more üò¶

[03-Aug-18 04:41 AM] JimD#9272
ya, its pretty interesting to watch a shitcoin like EOS getting billions in funding with a Delayed PoS algorithm because the ignorant masses think its founder is some kind of genius.  Of course its going to have massive TPS, its not actually decentralized.

I wonder, let's say you are someone worth a billion. And you see a relatively small market such as BTC.

[03-Aug-18 09:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And you see stupid people piling up short positions such as they are doing now

[03-Aug-18 09:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you market buy $10M worth of long positions

Is binance telegraphing what platform their chain is going to be based on @jl777c

[03-Aug-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
CZ is a smart guy and sees the future direction blockchain advances needs to take. just like ASIC took over mining, special purpose blockchains will overtake general purpose ones. having a single blockchain is just not a scalable solution, if only due to txfee for any single chain that gets popular

16000 sats seems like it was a capitulation as it was new low in a long time with high volumes
