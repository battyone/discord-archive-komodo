they looking to take tesla private ... careful ... currently inflated

[10-Sep-18 02:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I assume public means shares are available to public. and private means the shares in public will be bought back at set rate and only be able to private investors??

[10-Sep-18 02:51 AM] house#8741
yup

[10-Sep-18 02:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Not expecting a response on my offer, but just in case..

[10-Sep-18 04:55 AM] jspook16#3059
What's the offer

[10-Sep-18 07:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I like battery and EV

[10-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bmw mercedes and audi getting into the electric car game as well, look into where these guys source their batteries and buy that stock

[10-Sep-18 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Germans are better at cars than Elon, so they will pump out a lot more volume. Buy the company where they get their batteries from as that‚Äôs the thing the general public is only looking into in the second phase

[10-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought mercedes owned a % of tesla for battery reasons, so if these cars do well tesla will do well

@Poloniex @QtumOfficial Hey guys, you already received a couple of mails during past year that BTCD was transferred to KMD, and so after transferal period of 1 year BTCD is not in use at all. Please replace it on your exchange or at least delist BTCD for users sake.
