And maybe Verus, of which I have a small bag

[23-Jun-19 08:29 PM] actionslacks#4072

[23-Jun-19 08:29 PM] Tek#5253

[23-Jun-19 08:29 PM] Malti#3948
Who would it get sold off @hyperDEX ?

[23-Jun-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[23-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Tek#5253
my xmr bags aren't technically bags cause I bought them 7 days ago at 0.0106 btc

[23-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Tek#5253
and its at 0.0108 now

[23-Jun-19 08:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Malti miners will probably sell

[23-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Malti#3948
Didn‚Äôt miners already have DP accounts?

[23-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Malti#3948
So sell pressure could be the same?

[23-Jun-19 08:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But if people dont keep buying the price should correct üòõ

[23-Jun-19 08:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is too much buy pressure

[23-Jun-19 08:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586

As a team, you can do it

[23-Jun-19 08:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I was thinking should i buy some PIRATE with KMD, then KMD would surely moon. So ARRR holders please donate for my sacrifice üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 08:33 PM] Tek#5253

[23-Jun-19 08:37 PM] yorklab#7270
I thought about buying ARRR but then the price would dump, never to go up again. I wouldn't want to do that to the current investors.

[23-Jun-19 08:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[23-Jun-19 08:40 PM] Oszy#5734

[23-Jun-19 08:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
but we're just kidding around. no american would dare to trade these potentially criminal assets

[23-Jun-19 08:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Expo should bring parity

[23-Jun-19 08:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Of course @actionslacks

[23-Jun-19 08:40 PM] Alexfrog#1338
