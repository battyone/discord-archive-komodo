maybe not corrupt, but at least not very correct

[09-May-19 02:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh

[09-May-19 02:27 PM] Malti#3948
since a lot of corporations have the 'no bribery' policy actually you could call it corrupt

[09-May-19 02:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we dont do that.

[09-May-19 02:28 PM] Malti#3948
It just a huge opportunity to get inside corporate level with chainmakers

[09-May-19 02:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We have had to turn down many projects because they want partnerships and for us to take % of the supply in order to receive services.

[09-May-19 02:28 PM] Malti#3948
and KMD might or might not be the tech stack you go for when building a solution

[09-May-19 02:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and that is not just corrupt but could put us in a delicate legal situation since we should not be promoting the projects we build chains for.

[09-May-19 02:29 PM] Malti#3948
so you have to take a stake in the company you're offering services to?

[09-May-19 02:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It could be interpreted as misleading investors and stuff like that.

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] Malti#3948
well, you could actually. If you frame it as 'referral projects' for your business

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] Malti#3948
then it's perfectly normal to do so

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, no problem with that.

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We can be advisors

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or just service providers

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] Malti#3948
or solution provider

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but we dont take stakes on the projects.

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] Malti#3948
very lucrative business as well üòâ

[09-May-19 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
spent nearly a whole year build a paltform that trains testers and devs for CC.... Why need IBM ?

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
$$?

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] Malti#3948
correct

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can print money

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§∑

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] Malti#3948
and the name

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what blockchains do

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and of course, the brand.

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] Malti#3948
startups have no issue looking at other startups to do stuff, that's why it's such a strong ecosystem

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
IBM is not the same as saying KMDLABS or Chainmakers

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] Malti#3948
corporations look at other corporatiosn

[09-May-19 02:31 PM] Malti#3948
so getting inside IBM as a startup like Chainmakers

[09-May-19 02:32 PM] Malti#3948
is a ticket to other big guns

[09-May-19 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
if kmdlabs goes as planned, it will be all the training services necessary for someone looking to get involved with CC/komodod development

[09-May-19 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
BUT if you put KMDLABS or Chainmakers besides IBM, they look much better to other people

[09-May-19 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
not saying their isn't a place for a company to do that

[09-May-19 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
but like that's pretty much the whole point of it, foster a learning environment

[09-May-19 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```if kmdlabs goes as planned, it will be all the training services necessary for someone looking to get involved with CC/komodod development``` there is no such thing as "all the training necessary"

[09-May-19 02:33 PM] Malti#3948
ideas built on new technologies can only occur after right education has taken place

[09-May-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh the code is open source... IBM is already using shit that *I made* without *my help*  they dont need us....

[09-May-19 02:33 PM] Malti#3948
how other can people start thinking in terms of new tech/solutions?

[09-May-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
read all the code and figure out a solution :abusedsmily:

[09-May-19 02:33 PM] Malti#3948
functional people can't read code

[09-May-19 02:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you can either look it as a pessimit or as a optimist

[09-May-19 02:34 PM] Malti#3948
they are classroom kinda people

[09-May-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For me... IBM using something that I made... is awesome... shows it was useful... Dont really care aboiut anythign else.

tell me how stuff works and i'll think out a solution wiht that stuff and sell it

[09-May-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At elast I didnt waste my time on it

[09-May-19 02:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Are we doing the "im not doing it for money" meme

[09-May-19 02:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, then.

[09-May-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
I think the fact that they picked it up on their own without any involvement from us shows that documentation/ code clarity is coming along nicely

[09-May-19 02:35 PM] Malti#3948
correct, but now is time to capitalize i believe

[09-May-19 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
obviously money is required to live,,,, but its not what life is about .... ü§∑

[09-May-19 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
of course it is not what life is about... but then, if too many opportunities are missed, time passes and you still need money to live.

[09-May-19 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not sure if you get what im trying to say.

[09-May-19 02:36 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
you mean life is about spending them not earning only? :troll:

[09-May-19 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
meh... I guess maybe I shoudl ahev demanded payment for everything I did this year to learn and things would ahve turned out better ?

[09-May-19 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its not about demanding.

[09-May-19 02:36 PM] jorian#4555
@Alright you don't know that. almost all tweets from that lydia woman tag ca333

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When I did something useful, usually someone sent me something in return...

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] jorian#4555
also, theyr'e both german

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] jorian#4555
they probably met somewhere

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419
don't think ca would be the person to ask for help on CC matters to be frank

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Make useful things... know it inside out... money take care of itself

thought KMD was worth checking out and now they're doing release in a month

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419
not a knock against him, but it's not his specialty

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] jorian#4555
but he was the guy on all events

[09-May-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419
would be interested to know if they are indeed in contact with someone though

[09-May-19 02:38 PM] jorian#4555
@ca333 is the only guy who knows

[09-May-19 02:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@dukeleto seems to be in touch.

[09-May-19 02:39 PM] PTYX#6840

[09-May-19 02:39 PM] Alright#0419

ac_nk ... something I just deciuded to add once day to see if I could do it

[09-May-19 02:40 PM] Alright#0419
while only jl and I really had our heads wrapped around it(me much less so)

[09-May-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my bet is that they have been using LOTS of our stuff for quite some time...

[09-May-19 02:40 PM] Alright#0419
yes, seems that way

[09-May-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*asks for job at IBM tomorrow* ü§£

[09-May-19 02:42 PM] Malti#3948
life is not about money, but it's definitely also not about sitting in artificial light from 9-5 earning a paycheck to pay the bills

[09-May-19 02:42 PM] Malti#3948
so any opportunity to cash in nicely and retire from that lifestyle is one to grab with both hands imo

[09-May-19 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
kmd  needs the influx of paid jobs

[09-May-19 02:44 PM] Alright#0419
if every dev in this community was solely focused on milking every possible dime out of it, we wouldn't be this far along

[09-May-19 02:44 PM] PTYX#6840
wait until amazon starts taking what they like

[09-May-19 02:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so far it has been @jl777c pockets and NN funding the operation.

[09-May-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
true that also. I hope the time I put in learnig all this pays off, but I never did ti for money.

[09-May-19 02:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This needs to change in order for KMD to get to the next stage.

[09-May-19 02:44 PM] Malti#3948
that yes, but if you see interest coming on somehting you built out of passion

[09-May-19 02:44 PM] Malti#3948
why would you decline on that opportunity

[09-May-19 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
I wasn't talking about anyone in particular üòÖ

[09-May-19 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
just saying, it's not a good mindset to have

[09-May-19 02:45 PM] Malti#3948
and sometimes you have to force the opportunity üòâ

[09-May-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not declinng anything, far from it... Still learning, though... hopefulyl my skills are required by someone in teh future...

cuz money = innovation

[09-May-19 02:45 PM] Malti#3948
(not an exclusive relationship)

[09-May-19 02:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its not about particulars. Its just that the ecosystem needs several funding sources

[09-May-19 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as soon as I started getting paid for this.... my wife left sooo... yeah

[09-May-19 02:46 PM] Malti#3948
@blackjok3r why not go out there and see? Market yourself as an expert in what you love and teach.

[09-May-19 02:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We have not gotten this far if it wasnt for jl777 pockets... it needs to be said.

[09-May-19 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181

the mentalityof "no need for money" comes because there is actually money flowing.
