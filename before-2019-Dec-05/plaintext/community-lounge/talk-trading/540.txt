Very transparant as well

[13-Apr-19 10:54 AM] Markus#5464
Agree with @Strob that hopefully only 1 person/team get 1 NN each to make it more decentralized. Also less greed, but KMD whales/teams can easily vote up multiple nodes for themselves if they really want to

[13-Apr-19 11:02 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
after elections NN get some additional funding/preference in mining ?, is this funding decision  some way automatic based on votes during elections (some CC ?) or it's JL just assigning some special privileges to NN ? In the second case it's some way centralized -> elections are done but it only good will of JL to assign this privilege accordingly? or ?

[13-Apr-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the easy mining is coded into the blockchain rules. each NN is allowed to mine one easy diff block per 65 blocks. I have no control over who does and who doesnt

[13-Apr-19 11:05 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok so anyone can set the NN, so what is the election for ?

[13-Apr-19 11:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 
of the options you presented, the answer is:
`e) none of the above`

[13-Apr-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the election is to select the NN

[13-Apr-19 11:05 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I just do not understand part of it

[13-Apr-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
only NN are able to do this

[13-Apr-19 11:06 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but how exactly votes limit anyone from settin up his own NN ?

[13-Apr-19 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
NNs mine KMD just like I do or any other miner does, just at a lower difficulty setting because their pubkey is coded into the sourcecode

[13-Apr-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the pubkeys for the winners are put into the source code

[13-Apr-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
simple, effective and very secure

[13-Apr-19 11:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
who sees the pub keys and who puts them ?

[13-Apr-19 11:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
only winners see them / are able to put into source code ?

[13-Apr-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
all candidates publish their pubkeys

[13-Apr-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
after the election everybody knows what the winning pubkeys are

[13-Apr-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i make a list (more like given a list) and put it into the code

[13-Apr-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
why is this so hard to understand?

[13-Apr-19 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
every node and wallet running sees them, has a list of them, and enforces them

[13-Apr-19 11:10 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok , still it's based on good will of dev to put it into the code, of course anyone can verify it's good, but what would happen if JL was sick and could not do the code?

[13-Apr-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
then some other dev would

[13-Apr-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
one of the easier changes to make

[13-Apr-19 11:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's pretty trivial to update notary pubkeys, even I could do it :abusedsmily:

[13-Apr-19 11:11 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok so its actually based on community consensus that is verifiable, nice

[13-Apr-19 11:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
the really important part, is that the code in jl777/komodo is law

[13-Apr-19 11:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in the future is that possible that voting + CC -> autoamtic NN assignment ?

[13-Apr-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
possible but I recommend against it

[13-Apr-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
any bug exposes the entire network to attack

[13-Apr-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the way it is done now, it is nearly foolproof

[13-Apr-19 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform> too, depending on who you are

[13-Apr-19 11:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok sounds good

[13-Apr-19 11:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
if jl777 disappeared forever, KMD devs would make a new canonical repo, and everything would continue much the same, would be my guess

[13-Apr-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
and as long as an annual update is reasonable, the updating is not any real issue

[13-Apr-19 11:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you are right, that is canon, outside the castle walls 😃

[13-Apr-19 11:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
inside the castle walls, jl777/komodo is canon

[13-Apr-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
I could ask for someone else to make a pull request for this years update

[13-Apr-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but the code is basically done, just copy paste, update new pubkeys

[13-Apr-19 11:14 AM] dukeleto#7326

all they have to do is update that list, it's a trivial change for external coins as well

[13-Apr-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, PIRATE has a slightly different usage, but I was planning to make it all the same codebase so it is really easy to update

[13-Apr-19 11:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
>possible but I recommend against it
agree to it.
It's like a human factor is good to have when there's possibility of automating the nuclear weapon misiles

I read the 14th correct me if I'm wrong

[13-Apr-19 11:49 AM] Vertigo#0439
Nice ty

I can sell you my votes 1 vote to 1 kmd 😂

[13-Apr-19 11:51 AM] Vertigo#0439
Win win situation

[13-Apr-19 11:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
AFAIK, votes can only be sent once.

Decentralised corruption

[13-Apr-19 11:52 AM] Vertigo#0439
Lol

[13-Apr-19 11:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you send them to another addy for them to vote with, they are locked.

Never voted before I don't know how it works

[13-Apr-19 11:53 AM] 74D30#6106
At least the corruption is for the guys we want to have it

[13-Apr-19 11:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
When you have the votes, and have chosen a NN, you send you vote2019 to their address I their proposal.

[13-Apr-19 11:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Notary.pirate.black for more info.

[13-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Vertigo#0439
Ok ty

[13-Apr-19 11:54 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As to why anyone thinks holding 50x komodo@to attempt to secure a node for 2% gains over the year when KMD gives you 5% already.... well I guess that is on the specific user.

[13-Apr-19 11:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But try gathering and holding KMD to that # without making it moon.  I’ll wait. 😜

[13-Apr-19 11:55 AM] 74D30#6106
Hey dont hate on nerds. We need nerds

[13-Apr-19 11:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Wut?   We’re all nerds here 👍

[13-Apr-19 11:56 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Like last year, you'll probably find some NN willing to pay a portion of their mined coins to the voters. I expect it was extremely low since I didn't vote on any of those people and went with someone that actually made a product for Komodo.

[13-Apr-19 11:56 AM] 74D30#6106
Good point I digress

[13-Apr-19 11:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Isn’t hat what the 2nd N in NN stands for?

[13-Apr-19 11:56 AM] 74D30#6106
Lmao

[13-Apr-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
7% >5%, that extra 0.006KMD per year could mean life or death to some folks @FishyGuts

[13-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but it takes 1 million+ VOTES to win...

[13-Apr-19 11:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Kitchen Table you are correct.   This year we are discouraging it from a team wide standpoint.  You won’t find prominent team@members voting for those who offer voters rewards.

[13-Apr-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
10,000 KMD would then get 1% of that NN operators bribes

[13-Apr-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but it takes 1 million+ VOTES to win...`
OK, so $60 and not 6 cents 😛

[13-Apr-19 11:57 AM] 74D30#6106
I still run XP just sayin

[13-Apr-19 11:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That was my minimum math argument @jl777c about why fight to gain 2% when you already get 5% and have extra costs and work associated.  Just doesn’t add up.

[13-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
My voter reward was Hyperdex. I think I spent my vote points well.

[13-Apr-19 11:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Someone with 1M+ KMD probably doesn’t have the time to extrapolate an extra 1-2% for the efforts, costs and risks involved

[13-Apr-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is trying to remember exactly who he voted for last year 🤔_

[13-Apr-19 11:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s way easy to theorize it happening but try and find me someone in that position who would / could and wants to.

[13-Apr-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is at most 0.5%, and more likely 0.2%

[13-Apr-19 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Someone with 1M+ KMD probably doesn’t have the time to extrapolate an extra 1-2% for the efforts, costs and risks involved`
Even if they have the time, the total "value" is relatively meaningless, like the difference of 8 vs 9 people at 1 Sunday dinner

[13-Apr-19 12:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If I have the wherewithal to gather and hold 1M KMD, one months worth of effort for this gain is NOT in the realm of reality.

people seem to forget running a node is not a passive activity

[13-Apr-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
all this 2% math assumes no costs

[13-Apr-19 12:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There are MANY ways someone like this could earn 5-10% passively and push their income and growth efforts towards something worthwhile (IE something that got them 1M KMD in the first place).

[13-Apr-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`all this 2% math assumes no costs` 👈🏽 I want that NN, not the one the rest have

[13-Apr-19 12:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Our node manager @mrlynch quit his day job to do this.   It’s NOT a passive task by any means.

😎 

[13-Apr-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so the whale buying their own NN, would maybe net them an extra 0.5%, but that assumes they have a competent operator

[13-Apr-19 12:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Notary-Operator - what % of the devs you know could and would be able to run a NN?   I’m guessing it’s not a huge %

[13-Apr-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that 👆🏽

[13-Apr-19 12:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085

“Oh you mean I have to have a 10,000 rig or spend $300 a month on the testnet?  Just to try to get elected?”


Yeah no  thanks.  😂😂

[13-Apr-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
<https://notarystats.info/testnet.php?period=48h> 👈🏽 that's just 3 chains and I can assure you that the ones at the top didn't just `./m_notary_testnet` and walk away; there's no way to be useful and work free in a real NN

[13-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Vertigo#0439
You mean I can't use a toaster to run my notary node?

[13-Apr-19 12:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
running a notary node is a mix of dev + system admin + blockchain issues troubleshooting job

[13-Apr-19 12:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not every day dev can do it, but can improve themself to do it
