some open sourced, some closed.

[04-Jan-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
MIT I think you can actually close source it...

[04-Jan-19 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ah

[04-Jan-19 12:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But you still need to abide by the license

[04-Jan-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[04-Jan-19 12:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You cant get away from it

[04-Jan-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I make all my code on MIT

[04-Jan-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becasuse it generalyl that bad I dont think anyone will take it anyway 🤣

[04-Jan-19 12:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You also need to retain the code as it is, you cant just copy/paste it. You need to leave the files

🤔 

[04-Jan-19 12:58 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Or that is my understanding of it. So even closed source you will still need a file copyright blah

[04-Jan-19 12:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But anyways, i am going to take a break after the ledger app is done. The community can fund development efforts outside of the core team to help further KMD adoption.

[04-Jan-19 01:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For all that CG has said, it has never been to make money for me. If it was, i would have made money by not spending money on getting Ledger support, going through multiple different GUI dev teams for hyperdex and making the ledger claim app.

[04-Jan-19 01:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But i guess trying to solve a lack of GUI issue by getting talented GUI devs is doing a disservice to the community.

[04-Jan-19 01:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@hyperDEX your service has been much appreciated

[04-Jan-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its because of people like you this project is so good...

[04-Jan-19 01:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
you know CG likes to play the contrarian , just ignore it

[04-Jan-19 01:04 PM] jorian#4555

on other news, KMD/USD looks like consolidating after breaking above 41ema on the daily chart

RSI seems to be holding above 50 and 41ema is becoming support.

[04-Jan-19 01:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if this is the case and this holds, then 200sma daily is the next target

[04-Jan-19 01:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in KMD/BTC it already broke above, but KMDUSD still has some work to do.

@hyperDEX Tell me how WalletX not putting your name in a 10MB min file for code you paid someone to write for WalletY **isn't** about money, "doing a disservice to the community", and how it would benefit the community to have your name buried in said 10MB min file... 😕

2% isn't bad for day trading 👍🏽

[04-Jan-19 02:37 PM] dokrates#8987
i found a very nice way to trade

[04-Jan-19 02:37 PM] dokrates#8987
found 2 coins in binance that move opposite to bitcoin

[04-Jan-19 02:38 PM] dokrates#8987
once bitcoin goes up, one goes up, the other down, and in the opposite

[04-Jan-19 02:38 PM] dokrates#8987
so i've been selling one, and buying the other and so on

[04-Jan-19 02:38 PM] dokrates#8987
it didn't worked always, but at least i've been having 70%-80% of success

[04-Jan-19 02:39 PM] dokrates#8987
also sold top of stratis and top of komodo with those past bullruns

[04-Jan-19 02:39 PM] dokrates#8987

Anyone who copy pastes someone else's code, uses it with out attribution, then goes on to disparage the efforts of said code's original author is the type of person who should not be benefitting from the hard work being done and financed here.  That's my opinion on the Magnum wallet team.

[04-Jan-19 03:23 PM] PTYX#6840
@actionslacks i hate to bring this up again but there is proof that magnum had the claim function before any claims were made. They added the KMD claim function  Since the 16th of November at least.

_reserves comment since Magnum admitted code usage_

[04-Jan-19 03:27 PM] PTYX#6840
magnum used the code pushed by ledger.

[04-Jan-19 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
they credited ledger and a code audit was done. it was cleared with the internal Komodo team.

[04-Jan-19 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the larger picture, there's several issues
who did what to whom and when
and
Magum claiming to remove code and the claim that they didn't
The former I'm not getting into and the latter I'm far too lazy to fact-check either "side"...
My issue is, was, and will remain that a license isn't some magical thing that blankets unicorns in rainbows

[04-Jan-19 03:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But is magnum a wallet coming from kmd ecosystem? Im confused now

[04-Jan-19 03:36 PM] PTYX#6840
no, it's third party

@hyperDEX love your contributions!! Thank you and your team for everything you’ve done.

[04-Jan-19 07:35 PM] ver_User#6608
about price...

[04-Jan-19 07:43 PM] ver_User#6608
1950 seems well liked, not necessarily because of large amount of buyers but because lack of sellers (we are low volume now as mentioned). I'm expecting btc to break down a bit from here, and eth to break down a bit more.... basically a correction in ethbtc and altbtc pairs that are strongly correlated to bitcoin. KMD however is a strange beast, and looking at KMDETH we are at support and seem to be holding. 

Seems somewhat probable that ETH may drop and KMD holds this zone and begins another triangle/sideways correction of sorts... I'm definitely not counting out a slow bleed either, BTC is basically doing that atm... for btc - too many longs open, we need a decent shake down before upside IMO, all their stops are so obvious too, should be a good volume down spike incoming IMO. 

Anyone with more KMD experience with thoughts on this? Will we hold KMDBTC if BTC goes for a 10% or so shake down drop?

[04-Jan-19 07:50 PM] ver_User#6608
ETHUSD should be good for over 15% drop or more if we break 150 IMO

[04-Jan-19 08:00 PM] ver_User#6608
I'm probably way too early and optimisitc about KMDETH strength in general, but it's good to have that pairing to try to make some judgements from, and not just BTC correlations and KMDBTC chart alone

[04-Jan-19 08:23 PM] ver_User#6608
BTW are there any plans to ever have KMDUSD as a pairing? or is that heresy?

[04-Jan-19 08:35 PM] yorklab#7270
KMD/USD on something other than the Komodo platform?

[04-Jan-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
hitbtc has it, not that it is any good exchange

[04-Jan-19 08:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@PTYX How can the claim function work without my teams pull request to Ledger? They copy and pasted the code into their closed sourced app which REQUIRED OUR pull request to ledger to be merged (our devs worked with ledger CTO to get it sorted).

[04-Jan-19 08:43 PM] PTYX#6840
i never said ledger claim function, i said claim function. they had it working from the guarda wallet which had a claim functionality for over 6 months.

[04-Jan-19 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🍿

[04-Jan-19 08:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So why would you bring up they had a claim function? How does that relate to them stealing the ledger claim function?

[04-Jan-19 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no one stole anything

[04-Jan-19 08:46 PM] PTYX#6840
if magnum had the normal claim function working, then after ledger published your fix they would have been able to add ledger claim interest.

[04-Jan-19 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
steal
verb
    1with object Take (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.```
you gave permission, they just didn't forward that permission

[04-Jan-19 08:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Abiding by MIT License agreements = fine. Not doing it, they stole the code.

[04-Jan-19 08:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No they would not have.

[04-Jan-19 08:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They are totally separate things

[04-Jan-19 08:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Interest claiming = sendtoaddress

[04-Jan-19 08:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Ledger claiming = Lots of things

[04-Jan-19 08:48 PM] PTYX#6840
what is it that you want from this narrative @hyperDEX?

[04-Jan-19 08:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You tried to justify they had working code to claim interest, I have working code to claim interest from Aug 2016

[04-Jan-19 08:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So did i claim interest first?

[04-Jan-19 08:49 PM] PTYX#6840
ok......so does agama. what's your point

[04-Jan-19 08:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Your point of trying to justify them ripping our code and being "FIRST" is the problem

[04-Jan-19 08:50 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm laying things down as I understand them and were presented to me. i'm not justifying anything. what mattered to me was that this was cleared up with james and the internal team. it was, for me this is a dead issue.

[04-Jan-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So did i claim interest first?`
So now it's about who was 1st? what happened to it being about not having a copyright note?

[04-Jan-19 08:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So we are talking about Ledger interest claiming and you point to them having the ability to claim interest already. This is either you not actually knowing the difference or worse yet, do knowing the difference and trying to confuse others that are ignorant of the facts.

[04-Jan-19 08:52 PM] PTYX#6840
I am sorry if you feel this didn't turn out like you planned. Moreover, i'm sorry for all the time wasted arguing about this. I rather you cleared this up with the komodo team instead of kicking a dead horse.

[04-Jan-19 08:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Why would it be their issue? This relates to my code and magnums code which you seem to have some sort of connection to

[04-Jan-19 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`others that are ignorant of the facts.`
How is this plural? the only "fact" that matters (or so you kept claiming until now) was a literal single sentence

[04-Jan-19 08:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what is your motivation here? You are in no part related to any of this yet you keep responding like a dog with a bone to chew? You are arguing against someone that has done everything to make this platform more useful and more valuable. I dont care about your view of the world nor that people are scum. The fact you are arguing that because people are scum we should not do anything for the community is perplexing.

[04-Jan-19 09:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what is your motivation here? `
to continually point out that this isn't about the single sentence you pretend it is about

[04-Jan-19 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The fact you are arguing that because people are scum we should not do anything for the community is perplexing.`
I can't see how one has anything to do with the other
a disinterested 3rd party used your code and you shit all over the walls, acting like you're going to take your toys and go home

[04-Jan-19 09:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Well the community can see what kind of person you are. I dont believe in karma, but in this case i hope it does exist.

[04-Jan-19 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Well the community can see what kind of person you are. `
Long before your pretend claim of harm over one sentence not being buried in a 10MB min file 😉

[04-Jan-19 09:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will not be responding to you any more. I know you get a kick over people responding to you like a needy 16 year old girl, so i will not do so. You can chat to yourself.

[04-Jan-19 09:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I know you get a kick over people responding to you like a needy 16 year old girl`
Pot, meet kettle....
That literally sums up your whole throwing a fit and threatening to back out of the community over a 3rd party wallet (that literally isn't part of the community)

[04-Jan-19 11:24 PM] actionslacks#4072

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I have read a the whole back and forward. But I still don't understand your point of view. Do you have the time to explain it to a normal person

[05-Jan-19 12:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hastrup My point of view is that this is that any sapling javascript issues could have been solved in a few hrs back in Oct
beyond that, my point of view is that the claim that this is *all* about some MIT license level copyright in a file outside of this community that no one is going to decomplie and read is utter 💩

[05-Jan-19 12:33 AM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I don't know any about the Javascript issue back in
 Please filled me in.
But in other words you are saying that don't get to attach to a license if you don't have the money to back it up?

[05-Jan-19 12:34 AM] hastrup#8742
That came out weird.

[05-Jan-19 12:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sry, the js was me confusing 2 conversations

[05-Jan-19 12:35 AM] hastrup#8742
So if one post open source whit a license one should forget about the license when it's purplish

[05-Jan-19 12:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But in other words you are saying that don't get to attach to a license if you don't have the money to back it up?`
No, I'm saying that the only requirement of MIT is "mention my name", beyond that you agree they can do wtf ever
No one in their right mind puts MIT license on something and then gets **that** mad about their name *not* being buried in a single min file that's larger than my entire pool code (with the 270 included modules); it's about far more than that and he just will not admit it

bbl 🍽

[05-Jan-19 12:48 AM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 in a normal person point of view it sounds like you and Hyperdex had maybe one or more conflicts in the past. Ofc if the only requirement is to say hey Hyperdex thanks for the code. Then it's not that hard to do so. Are we not all on the same team we all want the best thing for komodo. So I really don't understand the conflict. Unless there is more underneath the surface. Meybe I'm just naive. But I just think we should promote invester not puch them away. But I see want you want to say about the license. And I really don't know this would it be better if it was gpl?

[05-Jan-19 01:02 AM] Likewise#6767
