[12-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Markus#5464

[12-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just imagine, you could have an extra $100k if you had 100,000 btc

[12-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What a pay day!

[12-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Mylo#8306
KMD top 50 is cool.

[12-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Sasha is going to do a buyback

[12-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Markus#5464
buyback -> add 10% stake reward/year -> shill coin -> price up -> free money

[12-Jul-19 05:39 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Basically yes

[12-Jul-19 05:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

wot? KMD mooning? well, i wouldn't call that exactly mooning, rather lifting its sore backside for a little scratching after all that BTC induced tumbling

[12-Jul-19 06:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yay, KMD not being a piece of shit üòÑ

[12-Jul-19 06:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
now that i comment, it willl probably immediately tank

[12-Jul-19 06:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Correct

[12-Jul-19 06:20 PM] LocoMB#8593
we need Trump to bash it! that will boost it to top10!

[12-Jul-19 06:20 PM] Alexfrog#1338
nice to see $1.60 again

[12-Jul-19 06:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
by the way: I strongly suspect that Trump is super pro BTC and is bashing it because he knows that it will be beneficial for BTC and crypto (thanks for the bashing Donald, can you do that every other week or so?!?!)

[12-Jul-19 06:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Crypto = largely left wing supporters = open fire

[12-Jul-19 06:24 PM] LocoMB#8593
ummm.. _largely left wing supporters_ except where snopes and SPLC sniff out KKK and neonazis doing their nefarious .. things with crypto

[12-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Alex Jones lolbertarians have a faction, probably mostly in monero

[12-Jul-19 06:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
I have to be forever thankful for a smear like that to alert me to crypto in Decemebr 2013, I occasionally check on these deluisions for laughs and giggles

[12-Jul-19 06:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
poor Charlie Stross .. Thanks Charlie!

[12-Jul-19 06:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
this is a bit aged, but a good laugh - he was gleeful after BTC falling from $1000 to $500

[12-Jul-19 07:08 PM] phm87#7395
Is it bad or good to share a "KMDBTC up" alert on a trading-alert channel of a bitcoin maximalist group ? (Mostly pro traders and TA experts so no risk for them)
Remark: I am a shitcoiner in their eyes but I am a bitcoin core fan in some eyes here ^^

[12-Jul-19 07:09 PM] phm87#7395
(I won t share right now, it needs to break resistance with some strength or I will be bullied there)

[12-Jul-19 07:09 PM] Markus#5464
the rejection is real

[12-Jul-19 07:09 PM] Markus#5464

[12-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Markus#5464

[12-Jul-19 07:11 PM] phm87#7395
