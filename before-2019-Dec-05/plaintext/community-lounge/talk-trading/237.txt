@bishop BTC has a very unique story, one that people seem to really like.  The big difference is satoshi is not present, right?  So with BTC, its like, do you trust the white paper,  the math, etc, because no one is trying to sell it to you.  Just the facts, sort of thing.  KMD is a live project with a figurehead that is 1) claiming KMD has the best tech while 2) refusing to identify himself.  so there is a noteworthy difference there

[21-Oct-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
when was the last time you looked into the face of the software author for a popular application?

[21-Oct-18 04:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
today

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] bishop#9773
Not sure I would go as far as to say KMD is trying to sell anything at this point

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and you dont run any software that you dont know the authors identity?

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] bishop#9773
the marketing if anything has been lackluster at best

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
take someone like Alex Mashinski.  he has a background, an education, a resume.  he is someone that people can look at and decide if they trust him

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
do you refuse to read novels written by authors using pennames?

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
nope

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
but i refuse to invest in anonymous authors to write books

[21-Oct-18 04:13 PM] bishop#9773
Do you have any vested interest in this project?

[21-Oct-18 04:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
i own KMD

[21-Oct-18 04:13 PM] bishop#9773
and why do you own KMD?

[21-Oct-18 04:13 PM] snowdamn#2414
Github is the book!!!

[21-Oct-18 04:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
its one of my portfolio long shots.  lots of big promises

[21-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont believe in doing "book tours"

[21-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but I do agree that if I did, i would sell more books

[21-Oct-18 04:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
i too agree

[21-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i just need to create such a large tech gap that KMD is able to solve things that other projects just cant

[21-Oct-18 04:15 PM] snowdamn#2414
i agree too, but this point is irrelevant when it comes to Komodo's prospects

[21-Oct-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
like a realtime videocasting chain

[21-Oct-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
among dozens of other possibilities

[21-Oct-18 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
heh, humble advice from someone who knows nothing, polish the things you got.  KMD suffers from unfinished stuff.

[21-Oct-18 04:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
unfinished stuff compared to what finished stuff in crypto?

[21-Oct-18 04:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
as a whole

[21-Oct-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
we create teams to iterate, like mm2

well, then delegate to a perfectionist the rest

[21-Oct-18 04:17 PM] snowdamn#2414
better

[21-Oct-18 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the artems are very skilled and perfectionistic

[21-Oct-18 04:19 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@jl777c were you always developing or also got some insight working in the finance sector?

or was it management

[21-Oct-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
might have been marketing

Banksy  and Hollowman anons too.   And so, from this their drawings become worse?

Every time KMD makes progress in technology or a whale arrives with hundreds  BTC\KMD to Binance , there is an immediate wish to arrange KYC for JL777, a strange correlation but it is.

[21-Oct-18 04:32 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@jl777c why have the commits been so silent lately?

[21-Oct-18 04:33 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
just working on older ones? did the system change?

[21-Oct-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
I am more a simple CC designer in recent weeks than a simple C programmer

[21-Oct-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont want the codebase centralized around me and CC are very very new, and we need more CC devs

[21-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
so I am working actively with projects to design their custom CC, new CC devs to code and debug CC

[21-Oct-18 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and by the time I am caught up, well, it is tomorrow

[21-Oct-18 04:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
Once you realize that the conventional financial system is run by literal criminals, the anonymity of those daring to compete with them makes a lot more sense.

[21-Oct-18 04:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
lol

[21-Oct-18 04:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
Sadly @Deleted User is right. The mostly insignificant current threat crypto presents has already created many martyrs that have been made an example of by the US federal courts.

holy moly, i am not saying he shouldnt be anon!  its like i am typing english but no one is reading it.  I am just pointing out that it comes at a cost

[21-Oct-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
@bpkdasbaum that is because I am finished with barterDEX

[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] snowdamn#2414
no way to know if meatspoon is a gov agent, but i'd wager he's an ICO HODLER!!! üòÄ

[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and that cryptomiso only counts barterDEX repo and not the dozen other repos

[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
only barterdex is on github?

[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
oh okay, i see

[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but more and more of my time is taken up with various pull requests

[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
cryptomiso has only room for one repo per project

[21-Oct-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the concept of 14 repos for a single project i guess they dont handle

If kmd is your longshot @meatspoon, whats your sure bet thats headed by a non anonymous person?

paycoin!

lul wait a moment, cryptomiso is using your personal account to pull the data? that's a bit silly. shouldn't it use all projects?

mtgox, perfectly safe with the public figure

[21-Oct-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, i think the scam total of public figures vs anon is heavily on the side of public figures

[21-Oct-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like the rhetoric that bitcoin enables drugs
