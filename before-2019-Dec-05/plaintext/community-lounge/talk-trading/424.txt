Sold kmd at 25 k should I rebuy at 24k or wait?

[18-Feb-19 04:23 AM] altcoinist#1501
any advice?

[18-Feb-19 04:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If I knew when to buy and sell I wouldn't be sitting at a computer, I'd be sitting on a beach made of hookers and blow.

[18-Feb-19 04:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Theoretically.

[18-Feb-19 04:34 AM] altcoinist#1501
@FishyGuts me too üòÇ

[18-Feb-19 04:37 AM] NNoperator#3835
definitely maybe

[18-Feb-19 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
1. pick a good long term project so worst case you just hodl until it recovers.
2. wait for it to be oversold, that is when the prices is below the fast MA, which is below the medium MA which is below the long term MA.
3. wait until it is overbought, that is when price is above the fastMA, that is above the medium term MA, which is above the long term MA.

[18-Feb-19 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it is very boring and you might go months between trades, but it is almost guaranteed to have a decent ROI. Spend the downtime learning

[18-Feb-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
use FA for selection, TA for timing

alternatively: try to pick every weekly/daily top and bottom using your powerful psychic powers. Get a 100% success rate and quadruple your money every week. Note this option is only recommended for powerful psychics with real precog abilities

Reality though, this seems like solid advice.

[18-Feb-19 04:41 AM] NNoperator#3835
we had number 3 conditions recently on the 1h charts

[18-Feb-19 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
basically short term day trading is impossible to be anywhere 100% correct and you end up kicking yourself for missing the last x% of the upmove, or whatever you didnt predict 100% correct. so psychologically it is easy to get into a negative feedback

[18-Feb-19 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
1h charts ?

[18-Feb-19 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
why not 1 minute charts?

[18-Feb-19 04:44 AM] NNoperator#3835
1 minute charts are for folks with ADHD

[18-Feb-19 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810
if you sell on a short term overbought, then you would end up waiting a long time for the oversold. so depends on your trading cycle. if you like to make a few trades per year and make 50%+, dont trade 1 minute or 1 hr charts, too fast

[18-Feb-19 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the faster the chart, the more theoretical gains possible from the percentage changes, but also the most losses are likely to happen.

[18-Feb-19 04:46 AM] NNoperator#3835
I suspect there are folks trying to trade on the 1 minute charts most of the time

one simple way is to just sell X% when it is up 50%, another X% when it is up 75%, 100%, 150%, ...

[18-Feb-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so as soon as you buy it, you put in all your sells and just wait

[18-Feb-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
very boring, but as long as some time in the future the sell prices are reached,you lock in your profits

[18-Feb-19 04:54 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 850 zeptoseconds (8.50 √ó 10‚àí19 seconds)   10 -5 refresh rate isn't going to help.  And we still won't be anywhere close to Planck time scale.

[18-Feb-19 04:59 AM] NNoperator#3835
It's too cold at my beaches, but I don't think it smells of dead fish there.  I'm gonna stay inside and trade, after I locate my coins.

[18-Feb-19 05:16 AM] Likewise#6767
Yep jus tgot back kid, but if you so smart and in the know, instead of insulting your investors why dont you tell me a realistic long to mid term target? Not talking fib level targets btu a target from someone in the know, a smart guy like you, kid

[18-Feb-19 05:17 AM] Likewise#6767
You seem to have a serious chip on your shoulder? Were you a problem child? Abused or anything?

[18-Feb-19 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
plz stop with the personal attacks

[18-Feb-19 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case your prediction that volumes will shrink back down to 100btc/day seems to have missed the mark

[18-Feb-19 05:19 AM] Likewise#6767
sure, jus think it is not OK when a dev keeps on going at an investor

[18-Feb-19 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
he is a community member, not an official dev. why do you keep repeating he is ?

[18-Feb-19 05:19 AM] Likewise#6767
just saw his name in that list so figured he belonged to the project

[18-Feb-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
what list?

[18-Feb-19 05:20 AM] Likewise#6767
right had side his name is under pool operator so figured he is somehow involved

[18-Feb-19 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[18-Feb-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810

[18-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Likewise#6767
ok understood. I'm ok

[18-Feb-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
let us keep discussions here factual and leave out the personal insults

[18-Feb-19 05:25 AM] Likewise#6767
fine for me

[18-Feb-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so far you have not followed that

[18-Feb-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i hope you will change

[18-Feb-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
"pool operator = someone that operates a pool"
"Coke owns part of Walmart because there are vending machines out front?"
vs.
"u got a lot of growing up to do kid"
"yeah yeah kid, u must be yank, so loud and obnoxiuos"

[18-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Likewise#6767
u know in some parts of the world, people dont take life so serious as you guys, when I say kid, it is nto meant in a degradign way, it is merely coz I'm sure I'm the oldest and except for devs I suppose one of the biggest KMDhodlers

[18-Feb-19 05:26 AM] Likewise#6767
it's all good man

[18-Feb-19 05:26 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Likewise You keep saying I don't know how to trade and from my position you plucked Dec 31 out of your ass. Your position is that it has merit. I've asked you 5 times to support that with some evidence and all you do is talk shit and avoid supporting your claim. Factually show me where I'm wrong.....

[18-Feb-19 05:27 AM] Likewise#6767
as I said where we live we dont take life so serious, chill out, go to the beach

[18-Feb-19 05:28 AM] Likewise#6767
now this is not an insult, jsut advice

[18-Feb-19 05:29 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
My chip is easy to knock off on any topic: show supporting evidence where my claim is wrong.

[18-Feb-19 05:30 AM] Likewise#6767
I think we understood each other wrong, you were mentioniong that may 18 high to dra some wick or something or fib levels..? Not sure. All I as pointing at, was that the last high of 31 dec needed to be broken if you count from the recent lows back in nov around 0.00013

[18-Feb-19 05:31 AM] Likewise#6767
I do not take TA very serious, I have always traded on global macro and of course use TA for entries/exits S/R but it is far from the hole grail. Of course in crypto Im lost with my global macro hence try to look for underlying fundamentals that can move this market

[18-Feb-19 05:32 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I came back with may 18 out of hyperbolic sarcasm after the 3rd time you refused to support what you were saying
