[28-Mar-19 01:36 PM] Caglio#3337
I usually send LTC there, its like 1-2 minutes max

[28-Mar-19 01:36 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
You have to decide to send before the pump. When is that? No idea but best to keep a small amount of play KMD on the exchange.

[28-Mar-19 01:37 PM] Caglio#3337

[28-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Caglio#3337
26900 is enough honestly

[28-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Markus#5464

8/41 is my trading strategy. Nothing famous

[28-Mar-19 08:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Those are the exponential averages i have seen to work the best, especially on the weekly scale

[28-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Keppie#5156
11/34 are mine üòÑ

[28-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Keppie#5156
W/e floats your boat

[28-Mar-19 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You can laugh, and you can use 11/34, but you need years of testing before actually knowing it works for you

[28-Mar-19 08:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
11 ema is to high for a fast moving average

[28-Mar-19 08:38 PM] Keppie#5156
It has worked the past 2 years. Can‚Äôt complain

[28-Mar-19 08:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
34 is too low for a slow moving average. But yeah. Whatever rocks your boat.

[28-Mar-19 08:39 PM] Keppie#5156
I‚Äôll give your ma‚Äôs a try

[28-Mar-19 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ema's

[28-Mar-19 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I only use sma's for very long periods

[28-Mar-19 08:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Like the 200sma which is part of my strategy too as a longer term base or ceiling

[28-Mar-19 08:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But most importantly i use bollinger bands, those in combination with 8/41 work very well in tandem

[28-Mar-19 08:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also mix that with RSI and you get some strenght measure combined with a good team of low, medium and long pace averages
