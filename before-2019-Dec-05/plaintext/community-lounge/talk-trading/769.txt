Now lets make that 100000

[15-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Excellent idea

[15-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Make it so

Ill provide a reflink-less link for the lazy :p https://zaddex.io BTC Pairs OUR pairs KMD pairs ZEXO pairs and like crabby said ARRR and VRSC support soon, I love DigitalPrice but I'd much rather trade/hold funds on Zaddex Exchange :9756_AppJedi: we now need a zaddex emoji for the discord as well :p

[15-Jun-19 10:14 PM] crumb#2550
not easy to talk about Komodo in other discords at the moment as inevitably the agama wallet incident comes up. a lot of frustrated dudes with negative mindsets trying to make Komodo look bad :abusedsmily:  trying my best tho 😄

[15-Jun-19 10:43 PM] p.#1126
Some new, positive news with a greater impact on the future of KMD would overshadow such nonsense.

[15-Jun-19 10:43 PM] p.#1126
Or even better, price going up . :2561_feelsevilman:

[15-Jun-19 11:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@crumb the incident was handled the best in crypto history

[15-Jun-19 11:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are they upset we didn’t fork like a bitch shitcoin

[15-Jun-19 11:41 PM] crumb#2550
there are people who don't like whatever you do so 🤷

[15-Jun-19 11:41 PM] crumb#2550
of course this incident was handled the best way possible

[15-Jun-19 11:42 PM] crumb#2550
main problem seemed to be: devs didn't check the code before release

[15-Jun-19 11:43 PM] crumb#2550
i gave them all the background info, but 🤷

[15-Jun-19 11:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This can and will happen to other projects

[15-Jun-19 11:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The way it is handled counts

[15-Jun-19 11:53 PM] crumb#2550
i told that too

[15-Jun-19 11:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is no way to be 100% secure unless you write 100% of your own code and even then you may screw up 😛

[15-Jun-19 11:53 PM] crumb#2550
anyways, you can't force people to agree with you so, it's all good

[15-Jun-19 11:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
People in glass houses should not be chucking stones 😃

[15-Jun-19 11:54 PM] crumb#2550
we here know this situation was handled and that's all that matters

[15-Jun-19 11:55 PM] crumb#2550
if someone uses inaccurate info we can correct them and point to information sources

[15-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
teaching old dog new trick, people with preconceived notion is really hard to change 😄

[15-Jun-19 11:56 PM] crumb#2550
it's their thing if given all available info, they still choose to believe something silly

[16-Jun-19 12:02 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but if you give them money , they will change real fast  😄 maybe 1 BTC each

[16-Jun-19 12:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No need to give them money....they can reflect on how they were treating us when their projects get hacked

[16-Jun-19 12:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Karma can be a great lesson

[16-Jun-19 12:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes it can be, and it can be a real bitch

[16-Jun-19 12:11 AM] crumb#2550
did someone say **BTCH**? 😃

[16-Jun-19 12:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What is going on with that?

[16-Jun-19 12:15 AM] crumb#2550
bitch sounds like BTCH. my poor attempt at making a joke :abusedsmily:

[16-Jun-19 12:15 AM] crumb#2550
time to take a nap, i suppose

[16-Jun-19 12:40 AM] meatspoon#7860
I am very interested to see how Zaddex goes.  Seems like it is a KMD-centric exchange.

[16-Jun-19 01:23 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
Seems like to many regulations in crypto now..

[16-Jun-19 01:24 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I wonder what Satoshi thinks about it

[16-Jun-19 01:51 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902

@mrdotboson I am bullish on $BTC because it is the most common currency to buy $KMD with.

Yeah its suck normally i never put my kmd at exchanges but felt i had to because of the hack... Guess shit happens

[16-Jun-19 06:44 PM] bishop#9773
Well, to be fair, you didn't HAVE to put your kmd on an exchange. There were other wallets that had no issues

[16-Jun-19 06:47 PM] alen#3721
Ive sent my to magnum mobile and it sucks ass

Yes...i sent maybe an hour ago around 0.07kmd that was second time today...the first tx was 0.2kmd and none of them showing in balance... and same thing happens last 2 or 3 days. Some tx go and some dont..i just.dont understand. The claim address is correct. 
I wrote them on suoport but no answer

[16-Jun-19 07:13 PM] alen#3721
Whats the other best mobile wallet for kmd

[16-Jun-19 07:15 PM] PTYX#6840
