It'll take a lot to make KMD bleed

it looks like we were below the rising tide baseline, until just recently, other than the big blip, so the hack did seem to slow down the rise

[08-Jun-19 10:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even if you go by the bottoms, KMD is still on a good rise

[08-Jun-19 10:29 AM] Caglio#3337
I just want kmd to hit 18.500

[08-Jun-19 10:29 AM] Caglio#3337
Fucking sick growth

[08-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
18.5 dollars?  Thats a start.

[08-Jun-19 10:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all things being what they are, $1.60 is "sick growth"

[08-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Or did you mean 18500 😛

[08-Jun-19 10:33 AM] Caglio#3337
18500 ofc

[08-Jun-19 10:33 AM] Caglio#3337
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 exactly

[08-Jun-19 10:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
eggplant units.. lol, metric or imperial?!?!

[08-Jun-19 10:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in many ways, the parabolic bull skewed many people's perception of reality

[08-Jun-19 10:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
shifting landscapes of reference ponits: FIAT losing its ability to sevre as reference, so it s becoming BTC and Gold

[08-Jun-19 10:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At the point where BTC becomes the "true" value baseline, the experiment of cryptocurrency becomes an utter failure

[08-Jun-19 10:35 AM] LocoMB#8593
and ofc with alts, we are in a double accelerator, BTC up, alt up in BTC, alt up² in FIAT .. 🏎 this is why we saw $10 KMD in 2017 .. that was fun! aaaand.. we'll get there again

[08-Jun-19 10:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC is an alt

[08-Jun-19 10:37 AM] LocoMB#8593
who is Brian!?! take him down! ... heads turn... _I am Brian_ .... _hey, wait a moment! I am Brian!!!_ ... _I am also Brian!!!_

[08-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Caglio#3337
@LocoMB my luck will be kmd gets to 10$ now

[08-Jun-19 10:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
I used to buy dips

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
But then I lost all my bankroll

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
cos coins dipped ( ltc in this case )

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
from 340 to 300

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
so I bought dip

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
i did it again on 260

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
and 240

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
and 200

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
and 180

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
and 150

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
and even 100

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
and it dipped more

[08-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Caglio#3337
fuck dead dip

[08-Jun-19 10:40 AM] Caglio#3337
lets just get back to 18500

[08-Jun-19 10:40 AM] Caglio#3337
so I can get back my kmd

[08-Jun-19 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you btfd you have to stfp, not just keep buying 😛

[08-Jun-19 11:03 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
regarding the price - hack can actually even increase it making KMD more popular - many online magazines now writing about KMD 😛

[08-Jun-19 11:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
There is no such thing as bad publicity

[08-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Did the idea of creating a kmd fund and using interests to repay losses materialize?

[08-Jun-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
no, i think it is better to just refund things and get back to normal

[08-Jun-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the reported losses are coming in a bit below initial estimates so far, but we havent heard from everyone yet

[08-Jun-19 11:52 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Ok, well if there is ever a community effort organised around this or any future such issue, since I'm not very active and might miss it, hopefully someone will let me know

so that's crypto: release tech -> price dump, get a wallet hack and rescue funds -> price pump

Hi! Any info when binance trading will be open?

[08-Jun-19 03:01 PM] yorklab#7270

[08-Jun-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
trading has been open

[08-Jun-19 03:04 PM] yorklab#7270
I was thinking withdrawals when he asked. Yes, trading has been going on.

[08-Jun-19 03:05 PM] shrk#2280
I selected the binance deposit address for the kmd return and now to make 0.0001 transaction I can't see what address i choose because the deposit is closed 😬

[08-Jun-19 03:06 PM] shrk#2280
Will wait, thanks anyway)

[08-Jun-19 03:07 PM] yorklab#7270
If you made deposits there before you can look at previous transactions to see the address.

[08-Jun-19 03:13 PM] shrk#2280
thanks for tip, a pity that I always only bought kmd, never transfer for sale

[08-Jun-19 03:15 PM] shrk#2280
