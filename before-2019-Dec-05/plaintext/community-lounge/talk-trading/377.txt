Seems that Grin felt left out of the 2018 bear market, so it did a 97% dump in one day: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/grin

Grins coin supply curve is better

[17-Jan-19 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181

there are a lot of miners already though

[17-Jan-19 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and you need to be online to receive funds at this point

Much depends on the BTC.

I would just like to remind that we are at $900 in January 2017.

End of 2017 at about 20k $ ...

[17-Jan-19 05:21 PM] tolken#2655
@Acura I am reminded.

Some ETH Miners Didn’t Listen To Postponed Hard Fork
Earlier this week, Ethereum developers sent out a message to the community to say that they were postponing the upcoming Constantinople hard fork update to the network. However, not everyone made the correct changes and there is currently a ‘parallel universe’ of Ethereum...

Interesting. So what’s the benefit of a side chain for z trans instead of main kmd chain?

Komodo Is Moving Z-Transactions From KMD Chain To A Second Chain
In an effort to showcase its unique multi-chain architecture, Komodo is disabling z-transactions from the KMD blockchain and moving it to a second chain.

[18-Jan-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
New Wallet Encryption Feature To Become Available
An additional benefit to disabling z-transactions on the KMD blockchain is that a wallet encryption feature will become available to all users.

[18-Jan-19 11:06 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yeah was wondering if I got it right. So just wallet encrypt, and the ‘“less emphasis” on being only a privacy coin? 😮

[18-Jan-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
part of rebranding

[18-Jan-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
many people perceive KMD as just a zcash fork.

[18-Jan-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe now they will take more than 5 seconds and look a bit deeper

[18-Jan-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
also wallet encrypt isnt a "just" level thing, I am sure that a lot more than 0.1% extra people will use KMD once it gets encryptwallet

[18-Jan-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
I know several that dont own KMD due to encryptwallet not being supported. and with <0.1% in zaddr, even if this was the only gain, it is well worth it

[18-Jan-19 11:09 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Gotcha thanks

[18-Jan-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
people ask when is rebranding

[18-Jan-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
well, here is a start and notice the name isnt changed and the logo is still not changed though pretty sure there will be a logo change, that is just one small small part of overall rebranding

[18-Jan-19 11:11 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
It also showcases what the new chain tech can do and what these devs are capable of. Which is funny because i was reading a tweet earlier regards the verge new "black paper" 🤣 V5 and its only 31 pages long. this new article is more technical than thier whole black paper is

[18-Jan-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is catching up to the Verge marketcap!

[18-Jan-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
which should be impossible according to "only marketing matters" peoples, as we didnt pay $75 million to get onto a website, or anything to mcafee, etc.

[18-Jan-19 11:13 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
not far off verge 101mil kmd currently 76 mill

[18-Jan-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i think a more realistic statement is that both marketing and tech matters and it might be like (tech * marketing)

[18-Jan-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so even with a very small amount of tech, a lot of marketing can get you a large marketcap

[18-Jan-19 11:13 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I still think the tech will speak for itself will pay off eventually

[18-Jan-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it also means that just a reasonable amount of marketing combined with a lot of tech will also get a very large marketcap

[18-Jan-19 11:14 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
As more projects choose kmd we get more and more marketing that way

[18-Jan-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the equation isnt (marketing / tech)... and with the 1/tech behavior we have seen at times, there is a chance that is the real equation

[18-Jan-19 11:14 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I believe inportant part of rebranding is to get a simple edu-slogan for KMD, so that it won't be "only z-cash fork" in people's mind. sth like "double spend protection + true privacy enabled + 5% interest rate" + ... idk what else? KMD sounds like a basic chain for dPOW and not sure how related to scalability ?

[18-Jan-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
though if that was the case, there is no way KMD can come anywhere close to Verge marketcap

[18-Jan-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is needed for the MoMoM, it is the main chain that gets all the MoM notarizations
