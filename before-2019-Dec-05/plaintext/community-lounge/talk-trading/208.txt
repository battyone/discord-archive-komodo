[14-Oct-18 02:15 AM] dan.#2473
So besides leaking his ip, what's the consensus

[14-Oct-18 02:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I hoped to bring in a crypto guy, you all flamed him with lawyer garbage

[14-Oct-18 02:15 AM] Instel7#1416
Lol, yes, poor guy

[14-Oct-18 02:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But that’s crypto life

[14-Oct-18 02:16 AM] dan.#2473
Lol

[14-Oct-18 02:16 AM] Instel7#1416
He had "educational" purposes

[14-Oct-18 02:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can’t take the heat, keep wage cucking

Someone did evetually mention dpow

[14-Oct-18 02:19 AM] dan.#2473
Out of 80 responses

[14-Oct-18 02:19 AM] dan.#2473
But goes to show it took 1/80 responses to mention dpow, no one knows it

[14-Oct-18 02:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[14-Oct-18 02:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Offered 1k pirate or 140 KMD

[14-Oct-18 02:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
He took the KMD

[14-Oct-18 02:22 AM] PTYX#6840
Not to mention the fallout he might get from the university for using their computers to carry out the attack

[14-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Japesmith#0609
I always find it odd when people don't know about other coins, that seem 'big' to me. I must just have more time on my hands.

[14-Oct-18 02:22 AM] PTYX#6840
He leaked the Unis IP

[14-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I made him the offer during the initial feed

[14-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’m a man of my word

[14-Oct-18 02:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Any questions?

[14-Oct-18 02:23 AM] Instel7#1416
It's okay hollowman, you did your part

[14-Oct-18 02:23 AM] Japesmith#0609
To be fair to him, he should be fine with regards to the uni... Unless he starts swearing at them

[14-Oct-18 02:24 AM] Instel7#1416
You paid him for coming into this troll and punishment orgy

[14-Oct-18 02:24 AM] dan.#2473
Hopefully no one finds out what uni,and brings it to their attention , might have their hands tied then

@Hollowman9000 You could have gave him 20 and said that's how much 1000 arrr is

[14-Oct-18 02:28 AM] Japesmith#0609
He wouldn't have checked

Good to hear

[14-Oct-18 03:17 AM] Geocold51#6462
A main dev and support memeber says "Personally as a person interested in tech, I loved the idea and concept. Sure there are going to be haters, but I think the greater Crypto Community is learning from the message you are spreading."

[14-Oct-18 03:17 AM] Geocold51#6462
Y'all some haters

[14-Oct-18 03:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Warning about Attacking random coins without informing them first is not hating

[14-Oct-18 03:19 AM] Japesmith#0609
I'm not a hater. I love you.

[14-Oct-18 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a good thing to demonstrate and without any financial gain, the liability seems small, but the laws are pretty crazy illogical in some countries. I welcome you to setup specific custom chains to attack and maybe even a chain with almost no hash, but with dPoW. would be interesting

[14-Oct-18 03:20 AM] Geocold51#6462
I agree

[14-Oct-18 03:20 AM] Geocold51#6462
the CFAA is a notoriously broad piece of legislation that can be used to make anything ilegal.

[14-Oct-18 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a complete lack of understanding of how insecure a lot of chains out there are. just do the ratio of daily trading volume to cost for 51%

[14-Oct-18 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
basically too little mining hardware for too many coins

[14-Oct-18 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why I made the dPoW. it isnt perfect due to the delay, but it sure is better than running without it

[14-Oct-18 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
I fully support security research in this area and there are all the lawyerly types around, so responsible disclosure is the key to avoid any issues

@Geocold51 had doubts about NN centralizatiom and no one here was able to clear that up? 🤔

[14-Oct-18 05:08 AM] Geocold51#6462
Nah

[14-Oct-18 05:08 AM] Geocold51#6462
Someone PMed me

[14-Oct-18 05:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, so you understood the differences of notaries compared to centrlized mining and stuff like that?

[14-Oct-18 05:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Notaries dont have anu dominance over the chains, just exchange messages within tx from one chaon to other

[14-Oct-18 05:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Worst thing a notary can do is stop notarizing. But then wont get kmd as reward for the service

[14-Oct-18 05:14 AM] Instel7#1416
@PTYX I need your meme collection

[14-Oct-18 05:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So you still have any doubts? @Geocold51

[14-Oct-18 05:16 AM] Geocold51#6462
I only got a limited explanation

[14-Oct-18 05:16 AM] Geocold51#6462
My understanding is that tehre are 64 democratically elected node operators

[14-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Geocold51#6462
13 have to agree

[14-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Geocold51#6462
It strikes me as centralized

[14-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Geocold51#6462
But the democracy aspect

[14-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Geocold51#6462
less so
