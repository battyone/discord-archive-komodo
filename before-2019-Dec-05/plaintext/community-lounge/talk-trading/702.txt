when the fuck

[30-May-19 02:49 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
is that fucking rebrand coming

[30-May-19 02:50 AM] grumpygoron#4320
@FlyingDutchman you will literally never get an answer lol at this point I’m just an addict who can’t quit KMD with hollow promises of “eventually” and “it’ll be ready when it’s ready”.

[30-May-19 02:51 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Rebrand coming when KMD at 100k sats.   market will be like: KMD was already awesome, doesnt need a rebrand.  Then price will drop. 😄

[30-May-19 02:51 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
they claim on the official channel that the rebrand and new product launches are coming "later this summer"

[30-May-19 02:52 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
lets hope they stick to that

[30-May-19 02:52 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
one of KMDs strong points has been its ability to deliver results through the bear market

[30-May-19 02:52 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
if we start making promises and never fulfilling them

[30-May-19 02:52 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213

KMD is pumping, as is every shitty bitcoin fork lol.   Even bitcoin gold and diamond.

[30-May-19 03:06 AM] richardt#2807
Yeah we'll see.  I sincerely hope everything works out and will be different this time around, but we'll see.  Just grateful we're finally out of the bear market

[30-May-19 03:08 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 03:44 AM] 차미숙#8912
As long as your coin is on binance

[30-May-19 03:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it matters.  i've had things go to 0 and other things 100x.

[30-May-19 03:45 AM] Alexfrog#1338
also it used to be 'as long as your coin is on polo'
