accumulation happened, news arrived and they used it as a catalyst

[27-Dec-18 10:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I don't play hthe trading game

[27-Dec-18 10:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm a holder, I truly believe that crypto being dominant by 2035 is inevitable

[27-Dec-18 10:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the world is globalising and a stock market that closes at 3pm isn't cutting it..

[27-Dec-18 10:59 PM] ver_User#6608
belief often has little to do with facts üòâ Jesus...

[27-Dec-18 10:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
True, I'm not religious whatsoever, but the fundamentals behind crypto is what I have hope for.

[27-Dec-18 11:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Because the other direction society will take if crypto doesn't win honestly isn't very appealing to me.

[27-Dec-18 11:00 PM] ver_User#6608
just bear in mind there is the "endowment effect" on assets, trades, things of value that you hold for a long time and believe in etc

[27-Dec-18 11:00 PM] ver_User#6608
it's very hard to let go of them, even when the evidence is there that it's time

[27-Dec-18 11:01 PM] ver_User#6608
you endow them with special powers they may not have, but yeah, we all love crypto, and probably everyone here is all in or mostly in

[27-Dec-18 11:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Not even that, I don't think anyone should have the power to make someone's money dirty on a whim or freeze someones livelihood.

[27-Dec-18 11:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
The government is ran by people just like you and me what makes his "opinion" more correct than anyone's elses

[27-Dec-18 11:02 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah for sure, but now that's not just bitcoin anymore, could be any crypto that gives us that freedom. Who knows what will hold value in the long term

[27-Dec-18 11:02 PM] ver_User#6608
it may be that we all have to migrate to privacy coins

[27-Dec-18 11:03 PM] ver_User#6608
for that utility

[27-Dec-18 11:03 PM] ver_User#6608
I would really like to see markets in crypto develop where every coin is traded against a privacy coin

[27-Dec-18 11:03 PM] ver_User#6608
so we don't all have to rely on bitcoin as the pairing

[27-Dec-18 11:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It definitely may not be bitcoin, but I know for certain it won't be bitcoin SV or bitcoin legacy

[27-Dec-18 11:04 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah I stopped following that shit a while ago, I was almost pursuaded by Bcash enthusiasts but after the fork I'm not interested.

[27-Dec-18 11:04 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm pretty sure theres atleast one more batch of bitcoin millionaires waiting to be made.

[27-Dec-18 11:05 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its happened twice

[27-Dec-18 11:05 PM] ver_User#6608
yes

[27-Dec-18 11:05 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I think it will happen a third once more before it's permenantly in an area where it can't happen again

[27-Dec-18 11:06 PM] ver_User#6608
3rd and final wave, 2017 was confirmation, what comes next is the safest most important part of the growth spurt, for everyone and anyone to get in on, with plenty of infrastructure to support. Orders of magnitude greater than the last ones because now you have all these fucking alts too

[27-Dec-18 11:06 PM] ver_User#6608
and genearlly you have to buy btc to buy a lot of alts

[27-Dec-18 11:07 PM] ver_User#6608
stil though, crypto millionaires won't be impossible after that, it's a new financial market

[27-Dec-18 11:07 PM] ver_User#6608
they will just have to trade their way to riches like anyone else in any other market instead

[27-Dec-18 11:07 PM] ver_User#6608
and the volatility is such that if you get it, you get rich

[27-Dec-18 11:08 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, I don't want to trade I want to pick correctly which is why I picked BCH and KMD.

[27-Dec-18 11:08 PM] ver_User#6608
opportunities will get less and less, volatility will die down, perhaps

[27-Dec-18 11:08 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If I lose with those 2 then so be it.

[27-Dec-18 11:08 PM] ver_User#6608
get some Verus

[27-Dec-18 11:08 PM] ver_User#6608
the one true coin

[27-Dec-18 11:08 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea i have some verus

trading is key to success in the end....if u trade instead of just hold u will achieve much much more and way faster if ur succeesful that will say, not everyone do will good decisions

[27-Dec-18 11:09 PM] ver_User#6608
nothing quite like verus, will be nice if it works out

[27-Dec-18 11:09 PM] BlackJesus#6161
My whole gameplan is to ride BCH up and diversify back into kmd lol.

[27-Dec-18 11:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I think kmd will be inherently useful with its ability to trustlessly trade between a multitude of coins. Liquidity the biggest problem kmd faces, and is something I would attempt to solve If I bet correctly.

[27-Dec-18 11:11 PM] ver_User#6608
@Markus yeah some basic knowledge is essential. However to be a trader, you have to get hurt a few times for it to work out in the end, so it's hard to advocate it. Crypto  growth allows you to feel like you have made a real success, but failure can be just as dramatic in this space

[27-Dec-18 11:11 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Never over leverage

[27-Dec-18 11:12 PM] BlackJesus#6161
recoup initial investments on gains

[27-Dec-18 11:13 PM] Markus#5464
thats why u trade a smaller portion of ur portfolio like 5% so even if u do a small mistake u can recover from it way easier

[27-Dec-18 11:13 PM] Markus#5464
unless u keep doing same mistakes over and over üòÑ

[27-Dec-18 11:13 PM] ver_User#6608
high leverage can be good, however what comes with that is tight stops

[27-Dec-18 11:13 PM] ver_User#6608
margin for error is tiny, but risk is still low

[27-Dec-18 11:14 PM] ver_User#6608
allows you to take very high RR trades, doesn't really work in anything but the "majors" though

@BlackJesus I think I read earlier that you said the burden of proof is on the IRS, no, it most certainly is not. One of the few entities where they can say something and if it's wrong, the burden is on the taxpayer to prove it.

[28-Dec-18 12:14 AM] bishop#9773
it's very true that their budget is shrinking but the IRS is outsourcing a lot of the wallet stuff to Chainalysis

[28-Dec-18 12:15 AM] bishop#9773
sure obscure alts won't be high on the list but the blockchain is your written record so they have all the time in the world to link addresses and tie in meta

[28-Dec-18 12:17 AM] bishop#9773
but considering the bulk of trading happens on KYC, half the work is already done

[28-Dec-18 12:18 AM] bishop#9773
but in actuality, the IRS really does need to clarify numerous scenarios since their 2014 guidance

[28-Dec-18 12:39 AM] Torankoku#4818
advising individuals to trade with the intention to avoid taxes is generally a bad idea

[28-Dec-18 12:39 AM] Torankoku#4818
but each to his own i guess

[28-Dec-18 12:47 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes, it's much better to advise paying as much tax as possible, because who wants currency that is absent government involvement anyway?

[28-Dec-18 12:52 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```Your Royal Majesty,
May it please the Crown, please accept my humble tax payment. Even though I'm a citizen of the US, I feel it my obligation as a user of cryptocurrency to pay tax to all governments that believe they have rights to my currency.

@Exile13 it's been a long time since I've dived into 911 shit but a buddy of mine pointed out that they search algorithms on YouTube ignore everything that isn't mainstream media bullshit. We are being sucked into the matrix and imo projects like komodo that preach freedom and decentralization are our only saviour... At the same time I know our chances of beating the totalitarian monster at our door is slim to none. Avapxia brothers.

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ if we are not careful and cex beats out Dex altogether we are in for a dark ride. Just like the internet,  crypto has the potential to do just as much evil as good.

I like to be aware of what I can be, as long as free will exists there will probably always be some sort of conflict wherever in the universe we go. I'd like to say let's learn from our mistakes and move forward, but who knows what really is going on, we go off the table scraps of what is decided to be shown.  @williamkeffer93

[28-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Exile13#4458
The post was to remind the viewers that sometimes a while bunch of money can go missing and nothing happens.

[28-Dec-18 03:15 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
@Exile13 I agree. The only true freedom I have found has come from the deep woods. To me komodo is a glimpse of that same freedom projected from a screen. I don't wish for riches.... I want freedom no matter the cost. I got your point but whether intentional or not it touch on much deeper points.
