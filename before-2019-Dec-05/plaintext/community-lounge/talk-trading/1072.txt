[14-Aug-19 02:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

retest of 200ma

[14-Aug-19 02:35 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Binance KMD reward seems to not be optimized. A lot of UTXOs are more than 1 month old here https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RCyANUW2H5985zk8p6NHJfPyNBXnTVzGDh

[14-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I wonder if Binance team knows about the monthly reward cap

[14-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Markus#5464
funny they use old kmd logo

[14-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Oszy#5734
as long as they pay me correctly i don't care if they claimed it or not ðŸ˜„

[14-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
If they didn't claim it, then your reward will be less if you hodl your kmd in binance ðŸ˜„

[14-Aug-19 02:44 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
But miners will get lot of bonus

[14-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Oszy#5734
They said they will distribut 250k bonus so I am assuming that is already claimed, + you'll get what you had on since the announcement.

[14-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Oszy#5734
I didn't hold any on there before so i am not in danger ðŸ˜„

[14-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Markus#5464
it was 250k its no longer ðŸ˜›

[14-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
250k KMD

[14-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Oszy#5734
it's in kmd

[14-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Markus#5464
didnt they say 250k $ not kmd

[14-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Oszy#5734
250k kmd and said 350k usd that time

[14-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Oszy#5734
i think

[14-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Markus#5464
250,000 KMD (~$300,000 USD) Initial Staking Reward Airdrop

[14-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Markus#5464
okay

[14-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
They will distribute it on 1 Sept , so we will see

[14-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Oszy#5734
lets se if that 250k gets dumped or not :7361_PepeWiZz:

[14-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I'll expect some dumpage

[14-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
But longterm hodl gonna do what hodl gonna do

[14-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Oszy#5734
is that addy you linked all the kmd on binance?

[14-Aug-19 03:12 PM] tolken#2655
How much Kmd do you think is on Binance? Iâ€™m curious how many Kmd from that pool will go to each Kmd.

[14-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
no, that's cold wallet , the hotwallet is https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RFaYXUJUE7CziS73EE6gvaqFduVo9KWjXT

[14-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
everytime it reaches 600k or more , 200k will get move to the cold wallet

[14-Aug-19 03:13 PM] tolken#2655
Ahh, only 3mill Kmd?

[14-Aug-19 03:13 PM] tolken#2655
Thatâ€™s a pretty nice ratio/payout

[14-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Oszy#5734
not bad

[14-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Oszy#5734
was just calculating what i can expect

[14-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Oszy#5734
nice sum for free

[14-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Oszy#5734
might move more in there

[14-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Oszy#5734
only 2 weeks away

[14-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
supposedly they are taking daily snapshot

[14-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah

[14-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not sure what's the formula gonna be

[14-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Oszy#5734
i won't w/d every day ðŸ˜„

[14-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Oszy#5734
i guess it's going to be (yourKMD/allKMD)*250K

[14-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Oszy#5734
if you have had the same amount at every snapshot

[14-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Markus#5464
what is the % u get yearly?

[14-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Markus#5464
5.1%?

[14-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
on Binance? probably less

[14-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Markus#5464
if u claim rewards

[14-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
5.1% is max

[14-Aug-19 03:16 PM] Markus#5464
k

[14-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Markus#5464
Binance claiming with 3 mil kmd would result in 12750 kmd per month

[14-Aug-19 03:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but I don't see that happening though based on their address

[14-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Markus#5464
Only thing i see Binance doing here

[14-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Markus#5464
is making ppl deposit their funds to their exchange

[14-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Markus#5464
and risk ppls money

[14-Aug-19 03:30 PM] Markus#5464
Dont know why u would want to do that

[14-Aug-19 03:31 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
gain user base

[14-Aug-19 03:32 PM] Markus#5464
This reward program is just gonna be efficient this first round

[14-Aug-19 03:32 PM] Markus#5464
this 250k is not from 1 month of claiming

[14-Aug-19 03:32 PM] Markus#5464
next months will be alot less

[14-Aug-19 03:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that 250k supposedly been accumulated since the first day KMD available for trading on binance

[14-Aug-19 03:35 PM] Oszy#5734
yea i am not doing it for the next round only for the bonus ðŸ˜„

[14-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Markus#5464

[14-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Markus#5464

[14-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Markus#5464

[14-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Oszy#5734
wouldn't mind if it stays 10k. easier to calculate ðŸ˜‚

[14-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Markus#5464
i expect it to drop to 9350

[14-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Oszy#5734
it probably will

[14-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Markus#5464
either it finds support there like 2 previous times

[14-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Markus#5464
or it breaks down

[14-Aug-19 05:19 PM] JimD#9272
We are accelerating

[14-Aug-19 05:20 PM] JimD#9272
my last BTC buy was 9300

[14-Aug-19 05:20 PM] JimD#9272
will we make it back

[14-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Markus#5464
i hope u sold at 12k

[14-Aug-19 05:20 PM] JimD#9272
11.4 ish

[14-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Markus#5464
thats fine

[14-Aug-19 05:21 PM] JimD#9272
I then put it in KMD which them promptly tanked

[14-Aug-19 05:21 PM] JimD#9272
but thats why I like to start out with my BTC buffer

[14-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Markus#5464
what i do is i buy kmd in steps to get a average

[14-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Markus#5464
this time i ran out of btc it dropped too much

[14-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Markus#5464
wasnt expecting 7k

[14-Aug-19 05:22 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, I think Im gonna scoop some more KMD at these levels
