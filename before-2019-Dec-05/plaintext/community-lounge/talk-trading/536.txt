_think we are talking off-topic in #trading_ 😛

[12-Apr-19 03:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That rarely happens

[12-Apr-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
normal stuff 😄

[12-Apr-19 03:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hehe 😁

[12-Apr-19 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181

:abusedsmily:

#talk-trading is actually #talk-general-2

[12-Apr-19 03:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's been kinda the case through the chat communities

[12-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
My trading advice is terrible anyway, @jl777c already said I’m a broken clock, right 2 times a day

I dunno had I listend to you and sold at 50k sat on 2017 at teh first pump I would ahve done much better 😄

[12-Apr-19 03:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
take another advice. don't ever say anything bad about yourself.
self criticizing is good, but too much is bad. Help your own self motivate by your own words.

[12-Apr-19 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, "I can do this" is very important.. Especially when you get hella stuck on something. fixing MoMoM was like  that for me, many times I was thinking, I dont know hwo to fix this, but I got there in the end... Maybe just need to do something else and come back to it. Working on other problems ususally solves a previous problem as long as you are always thinking about it.

[12-Apr-19 03:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Agreed again

[12-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Applies to all things

[12-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then the problem becomes where did that wrench land when I rage-chucked it across the garage

Being able to brainstorm with someone else also helps immensly. Without james and Alright around, likely would never have been able to complete half of LABS or maybe even 90% of it.

[12-Apr-19 03:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fair enough

[12-Apr-19 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thought that was more of a college collaboration channel

[12-Apr-19 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
With the partnerships komodo had

[12-Apr-19 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
#learntocode being more..

But I repeat myself

[12-Apr-19 06:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
My hybrid car has arrived

[12-Apr-19 06:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ty komodo

[12-Apr-19 06:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Jk not a cryptowhale 😞

[12-Apr-19 07:08 AM] klein#5233
Used gen 2 prius is pretty cheap

[12-Apr-19 07:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But are they really more fuel efficient?

[12-Apr-19 07:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Because they arent plugin hybrids? Or are they

[12-Apr-19 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are terrible. Better to just get a motorbike 😉

[12-Apr-19 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
uses 100x less fuel than a car and it goes faster

[12-Apr-19 07:56 AM] klein#5233
They aren't teribble

[12-Apr-19 07:56 AM] klein#5233
But yes a bike is more fuel efficient

[12-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But I like airconditioning and not dying because of retarded other road users

[12-Apr-19 08:00 AM] klein#5233
Buying a new one is a bad idea

[12-Apr-19 08:15 AM] Keppie#5156
Where do I buy/sell KMD straight for EUR ?

[12-Apr-19 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitpanda

[12-Apr-19 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bit pricier than kraken-> bittrex because of fees

[12-Apr-19 08:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But much more convenient

[12-Apr-19 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im a mecnahinc by trade and hybrids are terrible 😃

[12-Apr-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pointless... they are worse for the environment than a normal car

[12-Apr-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they are impossible to fix once they get over a certain age, plus the abtteries dont last

[12-Apr-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
waste of money

[12-Apr-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You want a good condition 10 year old car, before all the emission laws and look after it... it will alst and be reliable

[12-Apr-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the car I have now was $1000 and is still workth $1000 5 years later, maybe even $2000 😄

[12-Apr-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I goit an entire car of spares for $100

[12-Apr-19 08:54 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Would not sell his 2006 last of the line Toyota celica for anything . Cars after that period changed massivley

[12-Apr-19 08:56 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Just got a new 2019 works car 2 weeks ago. Vauxhall astra it covered 350 miles and the add blue system failed. Giving the car a death sentence in 500 miles if not fixed. 🤣

[12-Apr-19 09:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I get a company car as it’s cheaper than paying out more wage to myself and is tax deductible

[12-Apr-19 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also do like 1000km/week for work so need something that can last some time before breaking down :p

[12-Apr-19 09:11 AM] klein#5233
@blackjok3r funny that two of my friends are mechanics and say the exactly the opposite

[12-Apr-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are they city mechanics?

[12-Apr-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I live in basically the outback

[12-Apr-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
totally diffrent

[12-Apr-19 09:11 AM] klein#5233
Toyota

[12-Apr-19 09:12 AM] klein#5233
They are perfect but they are most reliable cars you can buy

[12-Apr-19 09:12 AM] klein#5233
Aren't perfect

[12-Apr-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe new cars 🤷

[12-Apr-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
AU falcon is the most reliable car you can buy

[12-Apr-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can be litteraly falling to peices and still drive

[12-Apr-19 09:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Nice!

[12-Apr-19 10:12 AM] Keppie#5156
Wait, did we drop below 2k sats yesterday? damn

[12-Apr-19 10:12 AM] Keppie#5156
Binance app did not tell me! 😄

[12-Apr-19 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, "we" didn't

[12-Apr-19 10:32 AM] Keppie#5156
WE are komodo

[12-Apr-19 10:33 AM] Keppie#5156
Have that community feelin , cute horsey

[12-Apr-19 10:40 AM] klein#5233
yeah there were some prints below 20k

[12-Apr-19 10:40 AM] klein#5233
but not much

[12-Apr-19 10:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`WE are komodo`
then I still stand behind:
`no, "we" didn't`
as a response to:
`did we drop below 2k sats yesterday?`

[12-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Keppie#5156
Gotcha

[12-Apr-19 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
0s matter 😛

[12-Apr-19 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
below 2k and I'm leveraging everything I own to buy up all I can

[12-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
2k or 20k?

[12-Apr-19 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he asked 2k

bouncing off daily 200sma from oversold territory and hidden bullish divergences. Thank me later if you buy now.

this was the last line of big support.

[12-Apr-19 11:20 AM] klein#5233
If the US stock indexes pump into all time highs

[12-Apr-19 11:21 AM] klein#5233
which I think it will

[12-Apr-19 11:22 AM] klein#5233
will probably push some money into these markets

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
definitively

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] klein#5233
massive risk on

[12-Apr-19 11:25 AM] klein#5233
then euphoria

[12-Apr-19 11:26 AM] klein#5233
makes a whole lot of people with  more money than sense get fast a loose

[12-Apr-19 11:27 AM] klein#5233
allocating capital into more risky areas

[12-Apr-19 11:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the fed just told everyone to do just that this year.

[12-Apr-19 11:29 AM] klein#5233
If we get a sustained bull run in indexes to noose bleed levels

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] klein#5233
would be cool

[12-Apr-19 11:31 AM] klein#5233
from now until the btc halving

[12-Apr-19 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, a rally in stocks will definitivley help the cause for a bull run in btc

[12-Apr-19 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and cheap money from the fed too

[12-Apr-19 11:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
especially now that there are institutional exachanges in place

[12-Apr-19 11:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it will be much easier for big brokers and lenders to get that fresh money from the fed and funnel it to the btc blackhole

[12-Apr-19 11:41 AM] klein#5233
some sort of a measured move like this
