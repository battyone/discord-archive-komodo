BNB coin isn't doing too well with the news of the hack.

[08-May-19 12:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
lol I was thinking how that would go over earlier

[08-May-19 12:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
A dex works for them too

[08-May-19 12:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Reduction of liability

fucking binance

[08-May-19 12:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so now everyone will be like: time to go back to bittrex.  then they'll try to log in to bittrex and find their account is closed because they didnt respond to needing to send a million kyc documents

[08-May-19 12:22 AM] yorklab#7270
Or start using Komodo's mobile DEX when it comes out.

[08-May-19 12:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
binance coin down 10%?  should be down 50%

[08-May-19 12:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD best performing coin in top 50 now

[08-May-19 12:59 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

Wonder If its some komodo insiders

`Hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and potentially other info. The hackers used a variety of techniques, including phishing, viruses and other attacks.` to me that sounds like not Binance was hacked, but the users... i hope that is the case...

[08-May-19 01:10 AM] Alecandro#1179
KMD doesn’t care

[08-May-19 01:34 AM] NNoperator#3835
If 7000 BTC is only 2% or less of Binance Bitcoin holdings that indicates that they hold over 350,000 BTC.   It is hard to believe so many foolishly trust exchanges with their funds.  SAFU my ass!

[08-May-19 01:37 AM] NNoperator#3835
Are there really that many whales trading in the millions of dollars, or do people just leave there as if it was their wallet?

[08-May-19 01:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Both

[08-May-19 01:39 AM] NNoperator#3835
I wonder how many times this will happen before the SAFU fund goes belly up?

[08-May-19 02:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who says SAFU can even cover this loss?

[08-May-19 02:04 AM] NNoperator#3835
CZ did.

[08-May-19 02:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are the safu addresses known?

[08-May-19 02:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
words

[08-May-19 02:05 AM] NNoperator#3835
```Are the safu addresses known?```    good question for CZ's ama

[08-May-19 02:07 AM] NNoperator#3835
Maybe they will need to liquidate some BNB,  that will probably drop it a few notches down from 7

[08-May-19 02:12 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
doubt he’s answering shit on that topic

[08-May-19 03:34 AM] altcoinist#1501
binance hacked?

[08-May-19 03:46 AM] altcoinist#1501
but funds were safu

[08-May-19 04:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Let’s roll back BTC.

[08-May-19 04:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If this is even attempted, it will be a sad day for crypto and a beautiful first step into a dystopia-capitalistic-Digital future.

[08-May-19 04:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
CZ is literally trying to become the meme.

[08-May-19 04:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And people are like “sweet.  Do it or no balls.” 

Even core@contributors. 🤔

[08-May-19 04:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
WTF is wrong with people.

[08-May-19 04:13 AM] PTYX#6840
They were talking about BTC. Like that's on the table 🙄

[08-May-19 04:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Put enough block rewards in and combine it with enough pools mining blindly.....

[08-May-19 04:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Spend your BTC now in case it happens 😂

[08-May-19 04:25 AM] PTYX#6840
I doubt it will

[08-May-19 04:25 AM] PTYX#6840
If it does, it wouldn't matter. The ecosystem would change drastically

[08-May-19 04:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes true.  Scary to consider.

[08-May-19 04:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Mining to pools is baaaaad. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 will be holding up his posterboard screaming he’s been telling us all along.

[08-May-19 05:42 AM] Alright#0419
I'd love to see a reorg attempt tbh

[08-May-19 05:42 AM] Alright#0419
would be some nice 🍿

if CZ rollsback BTC, what will happen with dpow?

[08-May-19 07:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
CZ doesnt have the power to rollback btc

[08-May-19 07:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If he did, that would be scary and I would consider going out.

[08-May-19 07:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But it wouldn't happen....







would it?

[08-May-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it could only have a chance if it is well financed and coordinated from the moment of the hack, ie. if the entire thing was an inside job. hard enough to maintain 51% attack, but to have to catch up after dozens of blocks... cost would be tens of millions and not guaranteed to work

[08-May-19 07:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And for what... get back 7000btc worth 40m usd...

[08-May-19 07:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not forgetting the negative price effect a move like this would have on the entire crypto market

[08-May-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm thinking the binance hack must have been an inside job

[08-May-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
a few dozen user accounts were hacked, most of them with high withdraw limits

[08-May-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe some internal file of high value accounts was leaked

[08-May-19 08:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But also their 2FA was compromised, how can such a thing be done on such a coordinated attempt without centralized inside help?

[08-May-19 08:11 AM] LocoMB#8593
some midlevel binance security fuckwit or PR dimwit using windows got a drive by trojan when checking his email in an open WiFi at McDonalds -> patience, escalation ...
or a targeted trojan in a spoofed dl in some media player or some such

Man-in-the-browser attack

[08-May-19 08:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes, but is that on the browser side of the account that was compromised, or on the browser side of the exchange?

[08-May-19 08:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume it is a very difficult thing to do to target a couple dozen accounts with high BTC holdings and compromise each of their browsers?

[08-May-19 08:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That's why it must be a flaw on the binance side/possible collusion/insider

[08-May-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
did anyone check the stream binance did?

[08-May-19 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
no I like to sleep during the night

[08-May-19 08:55 AM] jorian#4555
there he explained the hackers were slow to gather all the information and once they h ad enough, they used all the accounts at once

[08-May-19 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe listen to it when I'm in the car for a long time or so

[08-May-19 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm then it wasnt very targeted, but rather just months/years of collecting data and waiting for the right fish to fall in the trap?

[08-May-19 09:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That’s one theory the inside job theory is another.   I was thinking of how could they have gotten around the 2FA figured that somehow they were able to switch it off while still displaying it to the user.     It’s a nice mystery  that it shakes up Binances momentum

[08-May-19 09:02 AM] klein#5233

Stablecoin you know

[08-May-19 10:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So funds are not safu after all

[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
whalebro doesnt care, moves wall up to 191

[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
192 actually, slowly moving it up!

[08-May-19 10:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Wait... is a btc rollback seriously being discussed? LOL

[08-May-19 10:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If that happens i give up on crypto

[08-May-19 10:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Justin sun of tron wants to deposit 40 mil USDT to buy BTC, BNB, TRX,... to 'help' out binance

[08-May-19 10:05 AM] Malti#3948
how is that going to help if he's just gonna buy it in his account

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it lets him get PR about being generous

[08-May-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing else matters

[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no, rollback is not happening

[08-May-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
cz shows he is not an expert in how blockchains work, but to be fair a lot of the "blockchains" he deals with allow for censoring, rollbacks, account freezes, etc

[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
im sure everyone cz talked to about a rollback immediately shot him down

[08-May-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
bribing miners with a lot of BTC could work if it was orchestrated ahead of time

[08-May-19 10:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A rollback in btc would be the worst precedent ever.

[08-May-19 10:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
it would spawn an immediate 'TrueBitcoinClassic' - chain

[08-May-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
What is really funny, is people are learning what a chain re-org is, and now they have opinions, not understanding they are a core part of the protocol necessary for normal operation
