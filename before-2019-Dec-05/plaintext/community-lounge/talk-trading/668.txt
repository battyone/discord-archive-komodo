[21-May-19 05:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
acyclovir sounds nasty -.... like it will give you kidney failure

[21-May-19 05:22 PM] LocoMB#8593

'cocaine Cowboys', for free on youtube

I need to get myself a decent gf. I broke up with her bc she was really dumb and never listened to my advices

[21-May-19 05:55 PM] Tek#5253
also not pretty

[21-May-19 05:55 PM] Tek#5253
not that*

[21-May-19 05:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Well when you tell her to invest in KMD and she doesn’t listen , best to kick her to the curb

[21-May-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
well she had all kind of issues

[21-May-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
posture issues too

[21-May-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
and I wanted to help her fix it

[21-May-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
but she just never listenend to anything and just kept eating crap and genenrally being dumb

[21-May-19 05:56 PM] Tek#5253
so I had to break up

[21-May-19 05:57 PM] Tek#5253
she was very bad at speaking / communication too

[21-May-19 05:57 PM] Tek#5253
don't think I ever had a meaningfull or even just normal casual small talk conversation with her

[21-May-19 05:58 PM] Tek#5253
tightest pussy ever though

[21-May-19 05:58 PM] Tek#5253
