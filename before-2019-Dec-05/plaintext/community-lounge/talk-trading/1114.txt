ETH is 0.01633112 BTC per coin
current supply 107,616,284 ETH which is a little bit less than KMD at the moment (115,707,775 KMD)
total supply is unknown
1 / 0.01633112 = 61.2327874634 ETH

[05-Sep-19 01:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
out of all of these choices seeing which cryptocurrency is more value to me and has more potential to go up I'd just chose KMD

[05-Sep-19 01:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let's go with that reason too

[05-Sep-19 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
KMD has no max supply

[05-Sep-19 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
```
3 KMD until block 7777777
2 KMD from 7777777-7777777*2
1 KMD indefinitely after 7777777*2
```

[05-Sep-19 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
block rewards^

[05-Sep-19 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
"rewards" mechanism stops at 7777777

[05-Sep-19 01:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so assuming if the price of each token goes 10 times of current value where do we go with that, also knowing it also depends on the market of each different project tokens'  value going up or down based on time and adoption and it's technical richness to be attractive to developers

[05-Sep-19 01:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
EOS 10x
3231.95759671  * (0.00030941 * 10) = 9.99999999 BTC

[05-Sep-19 01:35 PM] dan.#2473
they say crypto is the wild west. crypto is scarier than the wild west was. so many shit coins over the years have bled into obscurity. i.e. 2014 cmc coins. so bear markets pretty much scare every hodler.

[05-Sep-19 01:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD
15549.68123153 * (0.00006431 * 10) = 10 BTC
that's 0.00064310... 64k+ sats

[05-Sep-19 01:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess I can just avoid calculating ETH

[05-Sep-19 01:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's just 10 BTC for 10x

[05-Sep-19 01:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
0.01633112 * 10 = 0.16331120 BTC per ETH price

[05-Sep-19 01:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you have to calculate these posibilities of what level of potential each token that you hold can go to in long term.

[05-Sep-19 01:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what development it is doing to advance and delivering on it

[05-Sep-19 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what level of price it may go, and if other competing market projects can actually compete on both technical levels and price levels based on its' current and past performance in both technical and financial track records

[05-Sep-19 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are actually many things to think when selecting a project to hold

[05-Sep-19 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
from both developer and investor point of view

[05-Sep-19 01:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's really then comes to the richness of your own knowledge on the subject and then analytics and decision making skills to decide on your portfolio value

[05-Sep-19 01:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
don't be emotional and try to calculate all odds

[05-Sep-19 01:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do love KMD and develope using KMD, but I'm not emotional on KMD

[05-Sep-19 01:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
"KMD max supply is same as XMR, infinity", via a tail emission

[05-Sep-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
In that way, KMD is more like Monero than most BTC-derived coins

[05-Sep-19 01:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If you are earning fiat and living with that fiat earning that also changes your choices to make certain decisions on market
now that there are many who don't earn in fiat, but mainly in cryptocurrency they has to take different level of decisions to stay safe from volatility in cryptocurrency and survive longer if not earning much

[05-Sep-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder i feel that last statement, in the feelz

[05-Sep-19 01:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ðŸ™‚

[05-Sep-19 01:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can tell from experience mate. full time working in cryptocurrency since 2016.

[05-Sep-19 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Caglio so based on your preference and earnings that you do and living off of your earning currency you have to decide how you want to keep your portfolio value

[05-Sep-19 01:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
getting paid in fiat would be so much less stressful, but that is not the life I live

[05-Sep-19 01:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd suggest you to keep a pie chart which keeps you updated with your holding value in BTC/FIAT

[05-Sep-19 01:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
and once you get used to it, planning for bear markets gets easier. The first 1 or 2 are brutal

[05-Sep-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i estimate that in about 20 years, supply will be still less than 200 million and growing at half a million per year. technically it might be infinite, but within 100 years, the supply is still 250 million

[05-Sep-19 01:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
have a buffer of 2-3 months always in your bank account for fiat expenses, and the rest you can chose to shuffle the value based on your preference of percentage that you want to hold in each cryptocurrency token

[05-Sep-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the supply is compounding at less that max compounding rate, so we will likely end up around 170 million at height 7777777, maybe even below that.

[05-Sep-19 01:48 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder hm

[05-Sep-19 01:48 PM] Caglio#3337
u messed me up now

[05-Sep-19 01:48 PM] Caglio#3337
with ur thorough mindset :)

[05-Sep-19 01:49 PM] Caglio#3337
but i wont buy any more eos for sure

[05-Sep-19 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I did not tell you what I think of EOS actually ðŸ˜„

[05-Sep-19 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only expressed what I think in terms of you want to know

[05-Sep-19 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
a money increasing portfolio.

[05-Sep-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so a 0.25% inflation rate and shrinking at height 7777777*2

[05-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, it's "linear" growth. y(x)=x goes to infinity, but much slower than x^2 but faster than log(x). Most don't have a good grasp on O(n) notation stuff and the different types of infinity. KMD supply goes to infinity *crazy slowly*. Slower than almost all polynomials

[05-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
don't mind my math talk

[05-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dan.#2473
technically that should still be... 5k kmd a year for a NN?

[05-Sep-19 01:51 PM] Caglio#3337
i would love to buy kmd

[05-Sep-19 01:51 PM] Caglio#3337
but im way too deep in it

[05-Sep-19 01:51 PM] Caglio#3337
i have enough litecoins

[05-Sep-19 01:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
NNs earn a fixed amount of KMD per time period, right now that is 3 KMD * blocks in time period * 0.75 % ish

[05-Sep-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the tail emission is to ensure we can continue with notaries indefinitely

[05-Sep-19 01:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dan. so that 5k number will change when block reward changes from 3kmd

[05-Sep-19 01:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
as an NN, it's common to earn about 1800KMD per month, disregarding big blocks

[05-Sep-19 01:52 PM] Mark81#4505
Other note to that is how about once btc for notarizing runs out?

[05-Sep-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
we have 10 years to solve that

[05-Sep-19 01:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Caglio do not overbuy KMD if you already has enough good percentage of KMD in your portfolio. that's why I said to calculate your holdings in a pie charts and decide what percentage of what tokens you want to keep there.

[05-Sep-19 01:53 PM] dan.#2473
just notarize to something else less expensive but still more secure

[05-Sep-19 01:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but it's also good to buy to cost average if you like.

[05-Sep-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mark81 @dan. there are hybrid options, like slowing things down a bit so that we target every other BTC block to be notarized, reducing costs by 50%

[05-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Mark81#4505
I think it would be necessary to figure thay out before btc price is too "high"

[05-Sep-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
that would be better than running out of BTC to notarize, and we can do that with a lot of time to spare

[05-Sep-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mark81 notarizations do not care about BTC/USD price at all

[05-Sep-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's just about spending BTC

[05-Sep-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
this cost is denoted in BTC, not fiat

[05-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Mark81#4505
Well buying it back from market is some sort of price.

[05-Sep-19 01:55 PM] dan.#2473
@dukeleto  that makes sense to me. or even holding off using BTC as the notarizing chain at the moment...in 10 years kmd might have way more important resources needing the best security possible. if btc is 1mil (lets just be hypothetical here), the security services of dpow will be absolutely valuable

[05-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder thank u for ur time tho,never seen u write so much :)

[05-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Caglio#3337
i just wanted a bit of diversity

[05-Sep-19 01:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I used to type a lot mate

[05-Sep-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mark81 @dan. this also might be relevant, but look at the SuperNET holdings

[05-Sep-19 01:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you got the taste today ðŸ˜‰

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
not sure what... maybe ethereum

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
i have none

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if have none, not bad to have some

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
If BTC becomes crazy expensive, that is good for SuperNET, because many investments will be worth a lot. If we run out of BTC to notarize, SuperNET has assets to sell, I guess. That is not my department

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Mark81#4505
11 million kmd.

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the reason is it's the top most currencies market value wise

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
when the value from BTC will go to alts, ETH will be one of the firsts

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
BCH and ETH will likely be the first alts to start going up

[05-Sep-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
and as James' said, we have at least a decade to figure this out. Bitcoin has only been around 1 decade

[05-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Caglio#3337
i hate ver

[05-Sep-19 01:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then don't be emotional and set your sell price in mind and sell if for BTC, if you like BTC more than ETH .

[05-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Caglio#3337

HUSH is going to push out an android app soon that connects to your full node, a custom 3D-printed "cloak" for an ARMv8 node and we hope to be a shining example of KMD tech. We shall spread the good KMD word. This will conclude my shilling.
