I wait until KMD is 1% of crypto marketcap before I sell my rewards, until then I am compounding

[07-May-19 10:51 AM] Malti#3948

[07-May-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
@jl777c if u do TA what is your favourite indicator?

[07-May-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
TA is only one of many factors, clearly it cant be ignored. I have stared at market prices for so long, usually some specific number pops in my head, like $5600 the other day. I seem to be right more often than wrong,  if being within some percentage of the prediction means i was correct

[07-May-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I recently found out about OBV, that seems a very promising indicator

[07-May-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but i dont like to spend time watching charts all day, so use a much more lazy method or comparable ratios

[07-May-19 10:55 AM] Markus#5464
I think Pivots with fibonacci setting is quite useful if u want to have a idea where price could go incase it goes up or down

good example right here

[07-May-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it can always go down 90%, can always go up 10x (used to be 100x)

[07-May-19 10:57 AM] Markus#5464

ive never seen a chart like VBK chart, it seems almost a straight line down, though occasional recovery but not for long. its almost as if there is something that is creating enormous sell pressure constantly

[07-May-19 12:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
komodo did this!

[07-May-19 12:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Aren‚Äôt the pop miners operating at almost 50% loss now?

[07-May-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if the cost changed from 1200 sats which is the last number i saw posted. is the BTC mempool less crowded

[07-May-19 12:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt know

[07-May-19 12:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Given the BTC price movement as of late I would assume ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù

[07-May-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
POP BITCOIN PCT

3.8 %

[07-May-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
seems 90% reduced!

[07-May-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i think at 4% of all tx, its still more than 100x dPoW but at least it isnt thousands of times. maybe this level can be absorbed in the mempool, but a few more halvings to get it below 1% would be even better

Hi everyone:

[07-May-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
seems miners can mine VBK with very little cost

[07-May-19 02:49 PM] LocoMB#8593
@Hollowman9000  - they are tightnening the screws, this $hittrex account was  fully verified, hadn't used it for almost two years, then sold & withdrew 5BTC from selling a few WAVES 
 ... roll out the circus horses üé™ üê© üê©  , wake up the trained poodles, seems $hittrex is falling over themselves in preparation of big brother crackdown..
they are located in Seattle iirc, so they want to make sure to be good doggies, always

[07-May-19 02:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I will never use bittIRS again

[07-May-19 02:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What additional information did they request, @LocoMB

[07-May-19 03:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
harharhar .. I don't know

[07-May-19 03:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
they sent me a link to a 'questionnaire.pdf' , whichm when I followed it, sent me to their ticket support system, to which I was supposed to open an extra support account for

[07-May-19 03:01 PM] LocoMB#8593
at that point I stopped even caring about what they wanted to know

[07-May-19 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wait so you were verified, and still closed it down?

[07-May-19 03:02 PM] LocoMB#8593
like- WTF?!?! they can't even be bothered to give me access to the questions they have, and want to make me jump through hoops to even oblige their snoopiung??
no thank you

[07-May-19 03:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah, full yverified with a withdraw limit of .. not quite sure, 100 BTC per month or so
now _on top of that_ they want to know the source of funds- 10000 measly WAVES  I sold there for 5 BTC

[07-May-19 03:04 PM] LocoMB#8593
not like I moved millions through that dump

[07-May-19 03:05 PM] LocoMB#8593

Joseph Stiglitz: 'We should shut down the cryptocurrencies'
Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-Prize winning economist, says cryptocurrencies should be shut down. Still, he sees the value in digital payments systems and supports electronic use of government-backed currencies like the dollar.

@LocoMB   you don't live in the US, right ?   If they really needed to know where those 10000 waves came from, they should have asked when you were depositing them...

[07-May-19 03:13 PM] LocoMB#8593
the 'Federal Republic of Germany' is so flummoxed by cryptos, they just treat it as 'virtual assets', so that if you hold it for longer than 12 months, any gain is tax free, which seems insanely liberal, but I have a hunch that it is simply because the taxmen are totally bamboozled by this new Blinkenlichten  ...
so in spite of the real life $hitshow this place is rapidly turning into, this one aspect that is actually quite nioce over here

Cash -> BTC -> shitcoin on exchange that no longer exists -> other exchange for other a shitcoin That no longer exists -> dumped shitcoin that no longer exists into an ICO for another shitcoin that no longer exists -> traded that on a blockchain dex for another asset that got absorbed into an ICO -> moved that around a few addresses because I thought they were compromised at one point of another -> bittrex to dump

I remember as a child we were going on holiday in hardcore communist Romania, they were quite welcoming to tourists with west money-
and then there was the 'official' exchange rate, and the street exchange rate, which was 10-20x better
