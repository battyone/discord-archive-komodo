They are not buying BCH, they are mining it.

So Craig's plan is to:

Sell BTC for USD
Use USD to rent hash for BCH
Mine BCH
Profit?

[14-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Jetter73#2234
@actionslacks This is like ISIS claiming a terror attack whenever it involves someone getting hurt. Craig is just using this news to push his own agenda.

@Deleted User Yep.

[14-Nov-18 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
checked his profile in private mode, he blocked me.

[14-Nov-18 08:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
even if he sells all is btc and takes price down to 1000 or even lower, it's golden!

[14-Nov-18 08:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Please do it

[14-Nov-18 08:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'm calling it here, right now
Wall Street is getting ready to pull a reverse end of 2017
dump into New Years, bull all throughout 2019
question is are we going to test BTC ATH by the end of 2019?

[14-Nov-18 08:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
if not a Wall Street scheme, expect it to shoot up fast passed ATH when least expected

[14-Nov-18 08:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
in less than a full year

[14-Nov-18 08:49 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I don't need btc, I only need kmd, but what bothers me is the Bitcoin domination, whenever btc drops, everything else will be in red aswell ðŸ˜‚

[14-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Jax#4739
A major market crash(like 2008) has not occurred in the United States since institutions started trading crypto. I wonder if it will be used as a hedge at all.

[14-Nov-18 08:50 PM] snowdamn#2414
not only we're still linked to BTC, we have to deal with this BCH horror  ðŸ¤¦

[14-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Jetter73#2234
@Jax No it wont be used as a hedge. People will be selling to cover shortfalls in other areas.

In a long for #BTC - SL raised to prevent loss. Wish me luck and hope you guys are staying safe out there.

Any sign of a breakdown again, I will take profits and run and wait for the next opportunity.

@Deleted User the crazies in that camp, imagine if Craig gets taken out by a nutjob that lost it all.

[14-Nov-18 09:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
i will never forgive Coinbase for adding BCH without notice 
was too early to legitimize, crypto struggling ever since

[14-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I read the rumours and took a gamble

[14-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Had some nice returns there

[14-Nov-18 09:05 PM] JimD#9272
Is now the time to buy ?

[14-Nov-18 09:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
how come the BCH boys kept their BTC then?

We could dPOW bch :trollface:

trollface 

[14-Nov-18 09:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
because without it it's just another BTC fork

[14-Nov-18 09:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
they didn't risk anything

T-Shirt idea:  Coinbase goes no lube

dPOW does very well to revive dead coins ðŸ™ƒ

[14-Nov-18 09:11 PM] snowdamn#2414
what do you mean so?
they're free to do it, but they didn't risk anything 
so, claiming it's BTC is laughable
burn your BTC after chain split if you have the balls, partner! ðŸ˜€

[14-Nov-18 09:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
instead they were coming out with tools to protect their BTC lol ðŸ˜‚

[14-Nov-18 09:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The clear solution to this debate is KMD

[14-Nov-18 09:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which narrative

[14-Nov-18 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the situation at btc/bch fork was kinda like in case 1 brain's half part is taken out and put in another body.
now that brain thinks, the half which is the left one is original and the other half which is moved to another body thinks that's original.
messed up stuff ðŸ˜„

[14-Nov-18 09:15 PM] modereck#4269
How many confirmnations needs btc to be confirmed on binance

[14-Nov-18 09:16 PM] modereck#4269
it says 2 but its not confirmed with 3

[14-Nov-18 09:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Bch was a interesting concept tech wise but it got to politized and too many poisonous people started having too much power in it

[14-Nov-18 09:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Imo they were able to sustain the narrative as long as they were united, once their own community starts fragmenting in this hostile way, its game over

[14-Nov-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
have you ever compared using BCH to BTC? It's night and day

[14-Nov-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
BTC is a steaming pile of dog shit

[14-Nov-18 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
It's only good use case is storing data securely

[14-Nov-18 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
most secure way to store data in the world it seems

[14-Nov-18 09:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Like i said, its a great concept tech wise. Sadly it lost hold of the community as we can see

[14-Nov-18 09:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes. And that what i see KMD as superior than BCH

[14-Nov-18 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
the concept is the concept from the whitepaper

as of now it's insane

[14-Nov-18 09:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is the number one thing i think makes this guy so toxic. Actually believing there is some entitlement about deciding who takes the "real" intention of satoshi is outrageous.
