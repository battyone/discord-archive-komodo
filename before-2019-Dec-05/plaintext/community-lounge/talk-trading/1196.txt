I dont use no bolinger clouds but ok

[04-Nov-19 08:20 PM] Flint#6435
look at the hourly or two-hour chart with the bolinger clouds and everything will become clear - we have broken through the upper border of the cloud very strongly and after that there is always a rebound down

[04-Nov-19 08:20 PM] Lanii#8302
your data of total (1) day should provide you great fortune in the future

[04-Nov-19 08:20 PM] Lanii#8302
The irony

[04-Nov-19 08:20 PM] Lanii#8302
Use a bunch of indicators to for everything to become clear

[04-Nov-19 08:22 PM] Flint#6435
a very good tool if supplemented by candlestick analysis! it works perfectly with Komodo since the asset will not go down silly anymore - we have found an approximate bottom and now get rid of weak hands - trading volumes are growing very carefully and someone is successfully gaining a position without the risk of sweating lower after consolidation and there is also a positive news background

[04-Nov-19 08:23 PM] Flint#6435
@TonyL Yes exactly

[04-Nov-19 08:24 PM] Flint#6435
maybe we‚Äôll see another wave if the volumes remain the same and then the correction consolidation and testing of new vertices

[04-Nov-19 08:33 PM] Lanii#8302
@TonyL Ok, how will you use this knowledge to your benefit?

[04-Nov-19 08:34 PM] Lanii#8302
Is this where you buy in now because rsi went into the rsi zone?

[04-Nov-19 08:35 PM] TonyL#3577
If you trade on hour timeframes (what I'm not doing for sure) it probably might be good idea to sell on some point when asset is overbought by hourly RSI

[04-Nov-19 08:36 PM] TonyL#3577
thats how I probably use this knowledge for my benefit. But I'm just stated a fact for the discussion above it's not any "signal"

[04-Nov-19 08:37 PM] Lanii#8302
ok, so sell when overbought and buy when oversold

it works until someone doesn't follow it üòÑ

[04-Nov-19 08:38 PM] Lanii#8302
if thats the strat you've been buying the entire bear market

[04-Nov-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Also I'm using smoothed average (the order of them is matters to detect the trend). But yes - sooner or later RSI will back to the zone

[04-Nov-19 08:38 PM] Lanii#8302
and gonna sell entire bull market

[04-Nov-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
We're talking about 1hr graphs

[04-Nov-19 08:38 PM] Lanii#8302
doesnt matter, strat applies to daily and weekly

[04-Nov-19 08:38 PM] Lanii#8302
4h

[04-Nov-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
For long frames trading you have to detect the trend

[04-Nov-19 08:39 PM] Lanii#8302
well I'd say your trying to detect the trend all the time, even in ltf

[04-Nov-19 08:39 PM] Lanii#8302
ltf > leads to htf

[04-Nov-19 08:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway I'm not a trader - just my opinion. Hope you got nice profit from your strategy

[04-Nov-19 08:39 PM] Lanii#8302
then obviously depending on the trader you might use different tf's for confirmations

[04-Nov-19 08:40 PM] Lanii#8302
@TonyL ah okk

[04-Nov-19 08:43 PM] Lanii#8302
I think everyone should just ask themselves if they expect a simple moving averege or an rsi indicator to make you money in the markets

[04-Nov-19 08:44 PM] Lanii#8302
Its really simple as that

[04-Nov-19 08:44 PM] Lanii#8302
It's one thing to say "rsi is oversold, its gonna pump" and another thing to actually execute that trade

[04-Nov-19 08:44 PM] Lanii#8302
But hey, thats just me

[04-Nov-19 08:50 PM] ronyi#5719
Many good traders here, but I think few people bought under 6... and prepareted the 5.... many things is going on here. I have CEH, ECSA, OSCP, OSCE, CCNA, MTCRE.... but honestly, many project in here and I no idea what exactly doing. So I need more focus on tech. :KMD: and thanks for all developers.

[04-Nov-19 08:53 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Trading on RSI alone is not an good strategy, but can be very helpful in reading divergences and used in conjunction with support/res and trend lines etc.

and if you look globally and at higher timeframes, then we are so oversold that it would be time for us to fly to the moon, especially since there are already many fundamental factors for this and with the launch of DEX, the sleeping giant will begin to wake up

[04-Nov-19 09:06 PM] Flint#6435
and on hourly charts a great opportunity to build up a KMD portfolio using these bursts of purchases

[04-Nov-19 10:27 PM] tolken#2655

the question is does blockchain has real use cases in general

[05-Nov-19 08:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes they do

[05-Nov-19 08:14 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Crabby Paddy but what clients are using these?

[05-Nov-19 08:14 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
at the moment

[05-Nov-19 08:17 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
it's not a use case until there is a case of a client using it

[05-Nov-19 08:17 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
and 'scalable' 'mobile wallet' are not use cases üòÇ

[05-Nov-19 08:21 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@PHBA2061 it has financial use cases but beyond that not really so far

[05-Nov-19 08:30 AM] PHBA2061#2530
real world assets tokenization, but the law must allow it

[05-Nov-19 08:35 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
financial usecase itself is the biggest in the world though ( trillions of dollars at least)

[05-Nov-19 08:36 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
blockchain is still in discovering stage , much like internet in the early days

[05-Nov-19 08:37 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
governance/government is another great usecase , imo

anything that involves many people where something of value is at stake and there isnt 100% trust of all the parties involved

[05-Nov-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
to say there is no use cases for blockchain seems to imply that whenever there are many people involved in something, everybody just trusts everybody else

[05-Nov-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
time is also an issue, many years from now, who can be trusted to properly remember what happened? with deep fakes tech, this will become more and more of an issue
