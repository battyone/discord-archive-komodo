Why is KMD mooning?

[28-Aug-18 08:50 PM] BlockTech#6895
because bitcoin is mooning, and komodo bottomed 3 times. Time to get back UP, maybe presentation about "smart contrat" and "rebranding" partenership is also part of it.

@AndrewMedal Nice article on blockchain scaling.
Had you known of @KomodoPlatform, you would be writing about their state-of-the-art tech and their solution to the scalability issue that beats VISA's tps.
