@Lumbi yeah, they have been putting the word out for weeks now.  They are decommissioning the bco blockchain and bco will now reside on bitshares only.

@KomodoWorld what kind of cool tech?

[17-Dec-18 09:02 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
like graphene, wormhole, spedn

[17-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Hegelian#0018
Ah interesting, I'll have to google that. I'm only aware of wormhole but it's that just a fork of omnilayer?

[17-Dec-18 10:22 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
afaik it's a different thing, there's also a counterpartycash

[17-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Vertigo#0439
I don't remember seeing one of those in a long time.

[17-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Vertigo#0439
Specially with volume tied to it.

would be the early bottom, usually will bounce about a few times

[17-Dec-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
On Twitter crpto cobin claimed it was him. Bought 900+ btc

[17-Dec-18 01:19 PM] snowdamn#2414
lol

[17-Dec-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it was 9000 BTC, it wasnt him

üòÖ ok

[17-Dec-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it should now bounce around 3700 to 3000, the 3000 mark needs to be retested

[17-Dec-18 01:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it was on this day, last year that btc reached ATH

[17-Dec-18 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
BTC bottom might have been this weekend

LTC likely the safer play.. there isn't much air left in them there tires.

If im interpreting this TA setup correctly, LTC might be ready for a move above $1k.
