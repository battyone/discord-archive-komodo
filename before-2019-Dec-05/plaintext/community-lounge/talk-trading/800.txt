Great buy support for kmd at 14k

[21-Jun-19 05:40 PM] Markus#5464
nice walls

[21-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Malti#3948
14k seems like the absolute bottom

[21-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Malti#3948
I hope we go to 12

[21-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Malti#3948
To fuel a massive bounce

[21-Jun-19 05:43 PM] Markus#5464
a bounce to 20k just in time for news 15th of july to then continue towards 30k

[21-Jun-19 05:43 PM] Markus#5464
would be sweet

[21-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Malti#3948
10k soon

[21-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Markus#5464
btc or kmd?

[21-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Markus#5464
cause im not sure 😄

[21-Jun-19 05:55 PM] dogracer#3298
I'm puzzled... Is it just me or is KMD flat or droppimg while the rest of the market rises?  This is not intuitive to me.

[21-Jun-19 05:57 PM] grumpygoron#4320
KMD definitely my biggest red bag right now. 10k BTC soon, 10k KMD soon lol just different versions of 10k

[21-Jun-19 05:58 PM] dogracer#3298
Maybe is a sign to buy up that cheap KMD then?!

[21-Jun-19 05:59 PM] grumpygoron#4320
That’s what we always say before it goes lower 😂 and then it’ll hit 20k again, we pretend KMD is pumping, and we all get excited until it’s back down to 15k

{Reactions}
😂 

[21-Jun-19 06:00 PM] grumpygoron#4320
KMD is a cycle of excitement to 20k and terror down to sub 15k

[21-Jun-19 06:03 PM] Tek#5253
just dropped another few hundred in bitcoin

[21-Jun-19 06:04 PM] dan.#2473

[21-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Tek#5253
i saw a 300 BTC buy order on gdax

[21-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Tek#5253
12k will be the top

[21-Jun-19 06:05 PM] dan.#2473
statistically buying the top usually works out

[21-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Tek#5253
ive been buying the top the past 2 weeks

[21-Jun-19 06:05 PM] dan.#2473
cause the top has a good chance to continue

[21-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Tek#5253
and it always went higher

[21-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Tek#5253
2 weeks ago i bought the top at what, 7k

[21-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253

💪 

[21-Jun-19 06:06 PM] dan.#2473
just gotta make sure top isnt a bull trap, but at this point, id say the consensus is pretty bullish

[21-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253
even if it is and it has a pullback to 8k

[21-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253
in the grand scheme of things

[21-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Tek#5253
everything below 20k is the bottom

[21-Jun-19 06:07 PM] dan.#2473

[21-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
yeah uhm i really don't think its coming down

[21-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
once it hits $10k there will be tons of news on that

[21-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
which makes it go even higher

[21-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
12k soon

[21-Jun-19 06:26 PM] dan.#2473

[21-Jun-19 06:33 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Joe smoe got burned last time they're not  going to bet the house anymore... But i hear institutions have been accumulating.

[21-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Tek#5253
ETH finally gonna blow?

[21-Jun-19 06:42 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Didn't it blow right from inception? 😂

[21-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Tek#5253
well yeah but the BTC ratio is like

[21-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Tek#5253
very low

[21-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Tek#5253
I remember last cycle when i was still a newb and I was buying eth at 0.04 ish and sold at 0.05ish

[21-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Tek#5253
but it went all the way to 0.11

[21-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253
I don't think im selling my eth anymore

[21-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253
i'll just hold from here

[21-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253
my eth, my xmr, my dash and btc

[21-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253
oh and bch

[21-Jun-19 06:44 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I'm no trader anyway... Just building my pension...

[21-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253
i tried trading but i got burned most of the time

[21-Jun-19 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
at this stage of the cycle, best to hodl through the small up and downs

[21-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
yeah im gonna hold

[21-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
also my kmd gonna hold and hopefully can buy more lower

[21-Jun-19 06:45 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
The only reason to use ETH for me is that transport fees are much lower than BTC...

[21-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
still need to get back my baby 5k stack

[21-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
tfw

[21-Jun-19 06:46 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
And usually I end up with more BTC after transport and exchanging... LOL

[21-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
I also want to add Zcash to my stack for when I want to be on american exchanges

[21-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
but the inflation is still so high

[21-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
annual zcash inflation is 30%

[21-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
so its not a great buy

[21-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
right now

[21-Jun-19 06:47 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I'm trying to dump some shitcoins bit by bit.... At the reate it's going now it'll take me 2 months, with heavy losses.... There's still a number of coins out there that keep gradually going down, despite the BTC going up...

[21-Jun-19 06:48 PM] Tek#5253
@jl777c whats the kmd inflation rate anual base?

[21-Jun-19 06:48 PM] Tek#5253
I thought I saw 7% somewher

[21-Jun-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
6.5%, but if you collect rewards regularly, effectively it is slightly negative

[21-Jun-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
6.5% is the max

[21-Jun-19 06:48 PM] Tek#5253
right need to move my stake back to a wallet...

[21-Jun-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
actual is 4.8% last i checked

[21-Jun-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
or 4.9%

[21-Jun-19 06:49 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Made a huge loss on one, but overall my portfolio is in good shape...

[21-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Tek#5253
my most risky asset is nano.

[21-Jun-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
its quite controversial
