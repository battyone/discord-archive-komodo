yeah i have used dai and usdc. by the way, i have heard about hush but never really researched it, will check it out. also, never heard of kmdice but wondering if the presence of chip supersede its need in the ecosystem? feel like the tech behind chip can easily be  integrated into a dice game. anyway, like i said i know little about it, so will research.

Multichain decentralized cashier for gaming
It has taken many years to finally be able to put together a fully decentralized system for one of the most demanding usecases, realtime…

[29-Oct-19 11:55 AM] Oszy#5734
about CHIPS and others ^^

[29-Oct-19 11:55 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I am not big on gambling.
I am big on acquiring gambling dividends, if possible.

```In conclusion, the komodo multichain architecture is shown to solve a previously unsolved problem of decentralized realtime gaming. Additionally, even though KMD itself is not used directly, it is required to create a pegged USDK chain, so indirectly the demand for a smart stablecoin with a built in cashier, will create demand for KMD```

[29-Oct-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
for those that keep asking why there is demand for KMD, here is another reason, but it is not taxation based, rather usage based.

[29-Oct-19 11:59 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I think adding decentralized realtime gaming and adding USDk, are big.

[29-Oct-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it combines the various proven killer apps, all into one

[29-Oct-19 12:00 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I dont lend my crypto. But many do. So I'm glad to see Komodo make a move into DeFi.

[29-Oct-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX for trading, stablecoin and gambling

[29-Oct-19 12:01 PM] napa#5694
been buying and holding kmd since 2016, didn't even sell in 2017 though i regret it now:) cos i could have reinvested and own a shit ton but still one of my fav coins.

[29-Oct-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the KMD pegs dont charge interest

[29-Oct-19 12:01 PM] Privatoshi#9487
But if you want to borrow against your KMD?

[29-Oct-19 12:02 PM] Privatoshi#9487
$80 for $100 KMD

[29-Oct-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you deposit KMD, and "borrow" up to 80%. you pay back exactly what your borrowed

[29-Oct-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
$80

[29-Oct-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
no interest for the pegs mechanism

[29-Oct-19 12:02 PM] Privatoshi#9487
That's actually really big

[29-Oct-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you do accept that if your loan ratio goes above 90%, that anybody can liquidate it

[29-Oct-19 12:03 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Let me ask you, why not 75%

[29-Oct-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
however, you can replenish the balance to avoid liquidation, so i think KMD price drop that increases peoples loan ratio might increase demand for KMD to prevent liquidations

[29-Oct-19 12:03 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Borrow $75 for $100 collateral

[29-Oct-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be any percent, we chose 80%

[29-Oct-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
that seemed the largest it can be while still allowing the overall system to rebalance

[29-Oct-19 12:04 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I only asked bc it just leaves you 10 percent.. but that makes it very interesting as well

[29-Oct-19 12:05 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Anyone can liquidate anything over 90%

[29-Oct-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, 5% to the liquidator, 5% to the system

[29-Oct-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
actually a bit more than 5% to the liquidator, there is an incentive to liquidate as soon as it is over 90%

[29-Oct-19 12:06 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I want to start to talk to others about this. Do you have an idea, an estimate, od when it will be live?

[29-Oct-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
each liquidation makes the overall balance that much better

[29-Oct-19 12:07 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Or replenish and bring it back down

[29-Oct-19 12:07 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Depending on price of KMD

[29-Oct-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
#cc-pegs is discussing the actual testing of a pegged chain tied to ounce of GOLD, it is the same mechanism as for USD, also a BTC equivalent that will have 1 minute blocks and 0,0001 txfee

[29-Oct-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
we just started testing it, so not sure how long it will be before it is live, we also are starting to implement the FSM CC, with cashier FSM as a specific usecase of it. Also needing a gui... i guess it will be next year before it is all working smoothly

[29-Oct-19 12:09 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I've been in there reading since you told us about it 4 or 5 days ago

[29-Oct-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but being able to take out interest free loans where the only cost is the KMD rewards you cant claim, and txfees, it is a very good tool. of course, with the connection to CHIPS poker, we have a built in demand generator to use the USDK in addition to a basepair for atomicDEX

[29-Oct-19 12:10 PM] napa#5694
@jl777c when you say next yr, from a probability standpoint, are you think 1st, 2nd or 3rd qtr?

[29-Oct-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[29-Oct-19 12:12 PM] Privatoshi#9487
And with USDk, we can pair it with any other synthetic asset, too. And, we should try to have pairings with sUSD, DAI, xDAI

[29-Oct-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
with so many different parts needed and we done even have any gui dev for it yet, i cant give any timeframe for completion of all the parts

[29-Oct-19 12:13 PM] napa#5694
understood

[29-Oct-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
anything that is mm2 compatible can be traded with anything else, a gui could offer built in conversions between the various USD equivalents

[29-Oct-19 12:13 PM] Privatoshi#9487
For liquidity and to have a bridge into ERC20 defi

[29-Oct-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
getting all this on mobile via nSPV will allow it to run basically anywhere

[29-Oct-19 12:14 PM] Privatoshi#9487
This sounds nice.

[29-Oct-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the atomicDEX gives us a lot of field testing for mobile gui, there are literally thousands of different phone models, each a slightly different computer

[29-Oct-19 12:15 PM] Privatoshi#9487
There isnt a base that you can take for all Androids?

[29-Oct-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if that were the case, there wouldnt ever be any phone specific issues

[29-Oct-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
or network

[29-Oct-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
in reality, there seem to be

[29-Oct-19 12:17 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I thought that there would be basic hardware requirements, for any phone capable of running Android 10.0. But I guess you still run into issues with all of the other working parts

[29-Oct-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
realworld app that connects to crypto networks, seems to push the standardization boundaries, but that is why we do extensive beta and stress tests

[29-Oct-19 12:19 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I've been doing txs and it has held up well

[29-Oct-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
when nSPV fully supports all the CC, that will port right into the mobile codebase

[29-Oct-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and with the pegged chains running, all the pieces can be put together

[29-Oct-19 12:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
AtomicDex is only one of 13 apps, that I run on my secure android device

[29-Oct-19 12:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
SilentDragon, FDroid, Signal.

[29-Oct-19 12:21 PM] Privatoshi#9487
SilentDragonLite, in next few days

[29-Oct-19 12:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
nSPV will be nice.

[29-Oct-19 12:27 PM] umitkara48#6464
Yes yes silent drogon

[29-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Privatoshi#9487
AtomicDex might be one of the only major releases in all crypto, to take place first on the mobile platforms.

[29-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Privatoshi#9487
That's awesome

[29-Oct-19 12:38 PM] JimD#9272
I got a little scared when I first saw the new graphic on the discord ......

[29-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Flint#6435
How much can poker and chips affect demand? Are there any rough forecasts for gambling and poker in particular in the context of the trend?

[29-Oct-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
are you asking how much USD demand there is for poker ?

[29-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Flint#6435
yes

[29-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Flint#6435
this is an awesome idea in itself! Better can only be the integration of decentralized oracles for betting!

[29-Oct-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont know the exact amount, but the total demand is many multiples of KMD marketcap, so it is not an insignificant amount. how much of that we can capture would depend on ease of use, it would have on of the lowest rakes

[29-Oct-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
prices CC can be used for betting on prices of synthetics

[29-Oct-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a publicly available data source for something, a DTO can be created and then bets made against it. with FSM CC a new FSM can be created to handle bets from any sort of things, including oracles

[29-Oct-19 12:48 PM] Flint#6435
The decentralized betting and prediction market is a very underrated technology! Even developers can go exponentially

[29-Oct-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the big problem with scaling the decentralized betting is the need for counterparty

[29-Oct-19 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We are planning on deploying various chains once we see that KGOLD is ready for public use.

[29-Oct-19 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The plan is to have a commodities exchange embedded in AtomicDEX

[29-Oct-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We will have GOLD, SILVER, PALLADIUM, PLATINUM, OIL, NATGAS, COPPER etc.

[29-Oct-19 12:51 PM] Flint#6435
for oracles, the mechanism of reputation points for regulating manipulations is relevant - are there any practical developments on this mechanism? For example, how is it with the Augur platform, which for some reason is still stalling and developing slowly despite the prospects of this market

[29-Oct-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Later Stocks could also be done.

[29-Oct-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we could import the FANG stocks

[29-Oct-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
@Flint oracles using trusted sources need reputation, DTO dont. basically aggregated oracles that use reputations are always going to have problems

[29-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Privatoshi#9487
@Flint Just think about this.
Last 24 hrs, WINk (TRX Betting Platform) did $7.8M in volume

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.

KMD Casino app coming soon ?

[29-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  in the foreseeable future there is a working mechanism for resolving this issue or need to be created from scratch

[29-Oct-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
no need for reputation, i solved it already with DTO

[29-Oct-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a much simpler solution, much less code, much less problems

[29-Oct-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i already foresaw this
