it's the only coin in my watchlist, that actually held usd value

[05-Aug-19 11:41 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
higher lows and volume also present, quite strong in comparison to all the rest

[05-Aug-19 11:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

higher lows?

[05-Aug-19 11:52 PM] p.#1126
KMD/USD is a 45 degree angle downwards

[05-Aug-19 11:52 PM] p.#1126
higher lows on the year maybe

[05-Aug-19 11:53 PM] p.#1126
wish thisTRADING channel allowed ppl to post

[05-Aug-19 11:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
but then we would be allowed to post our charts showing KMD going to 0

[05-Aug-19 11:56 PM] p.#1126
most respected TA's are calling for 6k-7k for kmd

[05-Aug-19 11:56 PM] p.#1126
but means nothing really

[05-Aug-19 11:56 PM] p.#1126
this coin has pumps from nowhere

[06-Aug-19 12:00 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592

[06-Aug-19 12:02 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
kmd whale scooped it all up

[06-Aug-19 12:11 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Kmd has fallen a lot in ranking

[06-Aug-19 12:11 AM] Buddz1993#5380
compared to waves

[06-Aug-19 12:22 AM] Caglio#3337

[06-Aug-19 02:47 AM] AkiraX#8269
Why is it down

[06-Aug-19 02:47 AM] AkiraX#8269
I thought it was going to 25000

[06-Aug-19 02:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
they meant 1000 not 25000 üòõ

[06-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Caglio#3337
We just had healthy bounce back of 0.19% , if we sustain it for a while, we will be down only few percent on daily chart

[06-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Alexfrog#1338
$1 stable coin

[06-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Alexfrog#1338
tomorrow 0.95 stablecoin

[06-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Alexfrog#1338
next day 0.90 stable coin

[06-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Alexfrog#1338
etc

[06-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[06-Aug-19 03:53 AM] Caglio#3337
@Alexfrog so you are saying we invested in very good stable coin with healthy downward trend ?

[06-Aug-19 03:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[06-Aug-19 03:58 AM] tolken#2655
I preferred the $3 Kmd stablecoin

[06-Aug-19 03:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its way better than tether, because it has gone from a $10 stablecoin to $1, while tether remains at $1

[06-Aug-19 03:58 AM] Caglio#3337
And also gives you 5% healthy gains , which tether lacks

[06-Aug-19 04:01 AM] p.#1126
:troll_hmm:

[06-Aug-19 04:02 AM] Caglio#3337
With most stable wallets

[06-Aug-19 04:02 AM] p.#1126
just cracked the 1$ mark again

[06-Aug-19 04:03 AM] Caglio#3337
Healthy decline of only 7.55% on weekly chart

[06-Aug-19 04:04 AM] p.#1126
could be much worse

[06-Aug-19 04:04 AM] Caglio#3337
Lambda coin still above KMD tho, with 24% weekly drop

[06-Aug-19 04:05 AM] Caglio#3337

[06-Aug-19 04:14 AM] Caglio#3337
already better marketing than stable kmd coin ever had :(

[06-Aug-19 04:15 AM] Caglio#3337
shiny picture and cointelegraph article

[06-Aug-19 04:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
is that what you want kmd to do @Caglio ? buy a cointelegraph ad? you gonna chip in?

[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Sanyadurnov#9361
@jl777c  do u have some interest from the companies in using antara after launch?

[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Sanyadurnov#9361
Maybe some big companies?

[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Caglio#3337
@Sanyadurnov well I am thinking 10 Grand is a decent chip in already

[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Caglio#3337
maybe i need to put a bit more

[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] p.#1126
@Caglio  fam chill lol

[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] p.#1126

[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] Caglio#3337
so selfish of me

[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
you paid that to whoever sold you that order

[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] p.#1126
^^^^^

[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Caglio#3337
exactly

[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] Caglio#3337
seems right now everyone just sells kmd tho

[06-Aug-19 04:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
nope no one is buying or selling. it's just exchange bots trying to move to random real bids and asks

[06-Aug-19 04:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
i could move the price right now using coinbene

[06-Aug-19 04:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
likely most are staking on binance or have iron hands and are waiting

[06-Aug-19 04:23 AM] p.#1126
few not most

[06-Aug-19 04:23 AM] p.#1126
most capitulated

[06-Aug-19 04:24 AM] p.#1126
pretty sure hollowman was trolling earlier as well

[06-Aug-19 04:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
thats just hollow. and at least he's funny about it.

[06-Aug-19 04:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
volume is anemic, traders are chasing other butterflies rn.

[06-Aug-19 04:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
kmd didn't kidnap your sister.

[06-Aug-19 04:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338
actually it did, theyre demanding a ransom for her of 1M KMD

[06-Aug-19 04:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i need you all to sell to me at 1 sat each so i can afford it

[06-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Caglio#3337

fortunately in a week or so itll be there

[06-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Caglio#3337
while they send money to a binance to cash out

[06-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Caglio#3337
million will be worth much less

[06-Aug-19 04:32 AM] Caglio#3337
they should have chosen some other coin

[06-Aug-19 04:33 AM] Caglio#3337
I just got a great marketing idea

[06-Aug-19 04:34 AM] Caglio#3337
Shit ill start working on it soon

[06-Aug-19 04:37 AM] actionslacks#4072

[06-Aug-19 04:40 AM] Caglio#3337
Do you think all of those US customers will migrate to atomic dex ?

[06-Aug-19 04:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Binance USA will probably be up shortly after that

[06-Aug-19 04:42 AM] Caglio#3337
So ? nothing happens then rofl ?

[06-Aug-19 04:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
the people who know are likely trading on the info and not telling anyone since insider trading in crypto is what the cool kids do now.

[06-Aug-19 04:44 AM] Caglio#3337
Wish I could get some inside information

[06-Aug-19 04:44 AM] Caglio#3337
Except falling for the best tech memery

Komodo has a bright future ahead from what I see.   Price action now sucks.  But it‚Äôs the market and Komodo has the funds to outlast the market fluctuations.   Development  will not cease regardless of external circumstances

üëÜgetting nightsweats about cmc rankings is a waste of energy. it always goes back up sooner or later

[06-Aug-19 04:49 AM] Caglio#3337
Constant as a price drop

[06-Aug-19 04:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
it does seem to get hammered back down pretty consistently whenever it breaks out.

[06-Aug-19 04:51 AM] p.#1126
No, it doesn't,  maybe w kmd but cmonü§î

[06-Aug-19 04:51 AM] p.#1126
Team members claiming bright future , well obviously

[06-Aug-19 04:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
