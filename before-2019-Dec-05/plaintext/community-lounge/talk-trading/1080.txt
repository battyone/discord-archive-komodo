[17-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Caglio#3337
I steal everything I can, sometimes I steal gin @ supermarkets

[17-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Caglio#3337
Just saying

[17-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Markus#5464
lol

[17-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Markus#5464
Does that make u happy?

[17-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Who says no to free booze ?

[17-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Ok religious muslims that dont drink

[17-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Caglio#3337
But who else

[17-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Markus#5464
I dont understand ppl who want everything free without any effort

[17-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm ?

[17-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Caglio#3337
No effort ( :

[17-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Caglio#3337
You need to steal the gin first

[17-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Markus#5464
Why do u need to steal it in the first place

[17-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Caglio#3337
It saves you money

[17-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Caglio#3337
I need money to feed of my gambling addiction

[17-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Markus#5464
Whats ur goal with life?

[17-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm

[17-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Caglio#3337
There are few

[17-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Markus#5464
Anything not related to sex and drugs?

[17-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Caglio#3337
But they are not that worth of talking about

[17-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm thats a good question

[17-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Caglio#3337
I would like to have a happy family one day

[17-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Caglio#3337
But that involves me spitting cum into some naive chick

[17-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Markus#5464
Lets say that KMD will make u quite wealthy

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Lol, no it wont

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not that much in it to make me quite wealthy tho

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
lets say it goes to 10$ which is hard, but if it goes

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
what then

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
I earned about 10k ?

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Markus#5464
would u spend the money in a good way or waste it on something u dont need that is just for fun?

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
I would pay off debt to ukranian mobsters

[17-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats probably a good way

[17-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Markus#5464
If KMD goes to 100$ what do u do with it then

[17-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Caglio#3337
But until kmd hits that, I will already repay that debt

[17-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Caglio#3337
I wont be here if it goes to 100

[17-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Caglio#3337
I would most certainly sell most of it at 15-20$

[17-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Caglio#3337
But lets say it moons

[17-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I would try to earn money as a trader then

[17-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Markus#5464
U know dealing with money in a smart way to increasse ur wealth do not have to be difficult its all up to u how hard u make it

[17-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I would take out money I initially invested

[17-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Markus#5464
In ur case i can see that u refuse to sell cause ur down anyway

[17-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Caglio#3337
Yup

[17-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Markus#5464
But lets see like this, kmd goes to up 20k tomorrow, we both know it wont survive very long

[17-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
u sell it and buy back cheaper and u have more

[17-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
so when do u buy it back? if ur unsure abit now and then as long as its below ur sell price

[17-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Caglio#3337
Ok

[17-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Caglio#3337
Lets say kmd moons to 10 bucks

[17-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
Im gonna sell it all

[17-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
That will put me on few thousands of profit

[17-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
the road to 10$ will be long and u can make plenty of good trades on the way

[17-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
I agree

[17-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
instead of 1k kmd u could have probably 10k if u do it well

[17-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont want to trade tho

[17-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[17-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Caglio#3337
I know, you got the point there, and with all fluctuations I should have at least tripled my kmd

[17-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Caglio#3337
I agree that was a good way to do it

[17-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Markus#5464
its never too late to start even if ur down

[17-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Caglio#3337
I know that, but still I wont do it

[17-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Caglio#3337
This way I can blame the rotten crypto market

[17-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Caglio#3337
Other way, I would blame myself and my stupid calls

[17-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Markus#5464
I can say i have been doing like this

[17-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Markus#5464
sometimes i been telling myself its time to sell

[17-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Markus#5464
but in the end i didnt and missed out on lets say 10%

[17-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Markus#5464
even if i knew i was right

[17-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Markus#5464
but u learn from ur mistakes

[17-Aug-19 05:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Well I agree with you

[17-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Markus#5464
With this said u can change ur life if u rly want to, i feel like u dont give urself a fair chance

[17-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Markus#5464
if u rly want a family and get wealthy u can cause why not

[17-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Caglio#3337
Family is nice, I dont want it yet tho

[17-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Caglio#3337
But in the end of the day, yeah

[17-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Caglio#3337
And about wealth

[17-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah that would be nice

[17-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
Lets take ppl as example who are multi billionaires, probably many started off with stocks or real estate i think that is the most common what i have heard about unless its a company like Apple or Microsoft

[17-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
they all have ups and downs

[17-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
just like crypto

[17-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Markus#5464
also

[17-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Caglio#3337
I can earn a lot of money by doing illegal stuff tho

[17-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Caglio#3337
But I quitted that back in 2014

[17-Aug-19 05:38 PM] LocoMB#8593
lucky you didn't get caught

[17-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess I dont like money that much

[17-Aug-19 05:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Honestly @LocoMB you just need a good lawyer

[17-Aug-19 05:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Honestly @LocoMB you just need a good lawyer

[17-Aug-19 05:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
no, usually the 'normal' illegal stuff has abysmal risk/reward ratio

[17-Aug-19 05:40 PM] Caglio#3337
yeah, depends what you do, and how good you do it

[17-Aug-19 05:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
don't tell what you did - üê° but all the stuff i know about is not worth the risk

[17-Aug-19 05:41 PM] LocoMB#8593
and I think once you reach a certain level, other factors come into play- like spook agencies when oyu are a drug dealer

[17-Aug-19 05:42 PM] LocoMB#8593
some white collar stuff may be lucrative- but this is sort of a niche high end crime

[17-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm I dont know

[17-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Drug dealing is a good buissines
