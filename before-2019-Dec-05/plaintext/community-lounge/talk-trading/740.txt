@Tek google just had a global multi-hour outage, they are still working on their CD....

[05-Jun-19 03:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
CD is a buzzword you tell VCs to get more money

[05-Jun-19 03:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
That is all.

[05-Jun-19 03:26 AM] Tek#5253
when I said pipeline I meant the whole shebang

[05-Jun-19 03:26 AM] Tek#5253
but deployment is maybe not atttainable

[05-Jun-19 03:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
if everything was easy to write, easy to code, easy to debug and easy to test across all OS's, CD would be easy

[05-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Tek#5253
so yo using a Jenkins or

[05-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Tek#5253
doubt you are paying a bamboo

[05-Jun-19 03:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
gosh no, this isn't corporate hellscape

[05-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Tek#5253
So Jenkins

[05-Jun-19 03:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
like I said, no corp hellscape. And jenkins is just made of CVEs

[05-Jun-19 03:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
Travis CI, open source goodness

[05-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Tek#5253
uhm I just wanted to share

[05-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Tek#5253
when I worked in enterprise

[05-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Tek#5253
github was a point of failure

[05-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Tek#5253
their hosting is set up like shit too

[05-Jun-19 03:32 AM] Tek#5253
better of having a repo on your own server(s)

[05-Jun-19 03:32 AM] Tek#5253
when the github dns had issues, builds had issues. when github servers had issues, builds had issues

[05-Jun-19 03:33 AM] Tek#5253
there were days where we couldn't really do much work cause github was out

[05-Jun-19 03:33 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Think this bootstrap is going to kill winzip

[05-Jun-19 03:34 AM] Tek#5253
> winzip

[05-Jun-19 03:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm stuck trying to download verus wallet thru a tethered phone. 2hrs left

[05-Jun-19 03:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck windows everything, KMD is what it was on though

[05-Jun-19 03:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That will be changing too

[05-Jun-19 03:43 AM] Tek#5253
7k bitcoin orders flashing in the BCH order books again

[05-Jun-19 03:45 AM] Tek#5253
it doesn't look like a manual whale etiher

[05-Jun-19 03:45 AM] Tek#5253
its not some dude putting and removing a buy order

[05-Jun-19 03:45 AM] Tek#5253
its a bot

[05-Jun-19 03:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
who is insane enough to let a bot flash a 7000 btc order

[05-Jun-19 03:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i guess Roger Ver maybe

[05-Jun-19 03:47 AM] Tek#5253
doubt its roger

[05-Jun-19 03:48 AM] Tek#5253
its funy cause there was a 100 btc sell order that was pushing the price down

[05-Jun-19 03:48 AM] Tek#5253
then millionaire bot came along

[05-Jun-19 03:49 AM] Tek#5253
and bought 1k BCH

[05-Jun-19 03:49 AM] Tek#5253
from it

[05-Jun-19 03:49 AM] Tek#5253
maybe the 7k buttcoin bot is one of Jihan/Ver/andfrens.  to support the price

[05-Jun-19 03:50 AM] Tek#5253
since seemingly there's bots trying to push it down

[05-Jun-19 03:55 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Satoshi diversifying?

[05-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its whalebro, he is mad at KMD for security issue, switching to BCH üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Tek#5253
lol

[05-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and he had 100x as much btc now for some reason

[05-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Tek#5253
CSW is behind tanking of many alts

[05-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 04:27 AM] Tek#5253
I don't think im gonna sell my kmd stack

[05-Jun-19 04:27 AM] Tek#5253
It took a lot of effort to gather and store this over the past few months

[05-Jun-19 04:28 AM] Tek#5253
not gonna risk selling my potential 50x

[05-Jun-19 04:28 AM] Alecandro#1179
This will blow over in a day or so I‚Äôm sure

[05-Jun-19 04:28 AM] Tek#5253
my trust in the competince of the team has deminshed a bit tho

[05-Jun-19 04:29 AM] Tek#5253
if only we got some info about what is fucking wrong

[05-Jun-19 04:30 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
phew! moved all my assets , üòÖ

[05-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Alecandro#1179
Just give them some time. How much does it hurt to just move your coins for now. Then they‚Äôll announce what happened and we can move on from there. No use inciting mass hysteria I suppose

[05-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Alecandro#1179
But whatevs we will see

[05-Jun-19 04:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm gonna diversify into pirate and verus a little bit more but that was probably a good idea anyway

[05-Jun-19 04:32 AM] Alexfrog#1338
please incite mass hysteria, i sold first and want to rebuy super cheap at a profit üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 04:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i can only rebuy at a 5% gain right now, what is this crap

[05-Jun-19 04:33 AM] Alecandro#1179
Haha fair @Alexfrog

[05-Jun-19 04:33 AM] Tek#5253
@Alexfrog 5% is pretty good

[05-Jun-19 04:33 AM] Alecandro#1179
Buy the bloooooooood

[05-Jun-19 04:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338
5% isnt blood, 30% is blood, give me real blood

[05-Jun-19 04:34 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 04:34 AM] Alecandro#1179
