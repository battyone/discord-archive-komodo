[09-Aug-19 12:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He has used every scammers move to try to pump the price of his coin

[09-Aug-19 12:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I wonder how much of the 30k BTC he has left......seems like waves running under NAV

[09-Aug-19 12:35 PM] Markus#5464
might have btc but intention might be to not use it

[09-Aug-19 12:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
or they cashed out most of it

[09-Aug-19 12:42 PM] Markus#5464
I wonder what happened with all the bitcoins from bitconnect

[09-Aug-19 12:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Gone as soon as it entered their "exchange'

[09-Aug-19 12:43 PM] Markus#5464
Yes ofc gone but they must have gone somewhere, did anyone ever try to track them to even find out how much they could of been holding?

[09-Aug-19 03:21 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
can i get a k64 livestream tldr

[09-Aug-19 03:34 PM] dan.#2473
this is in the k64 channel that is archived:

[09-Aug-19 03:34 PM] dan.#2473
```ca333Today at 11:20 AM
We from Komodo have unfortunately not been able to validate K64's claims about a 78M EUR investment from Goldman Sachs. We have approached Goldman Sachs but were unable to verify these claims. Publicly available data also suggests Komodore64 does not meet the requirements in order to qualify for such an investment. We publicly distance from K64 and want to point out that at no time has the Komodo team been involved in these activities. Please be cautious and do your own due diligence before investing in any project.```

lol so fkn silly

[09-Aug-19 03:37 PM] Markus#5464
why the hell would goldman sachs invest into k64

[09-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Markus#5464
theres a saying "if its too good to be true it is"

[09-Aug-19 03:40 PM] Markus#5464
if Goldman Sachs would invest into something then why would they invest into K64 of all and not KMD?

[09-Aug-19 03:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
sigh, also komodo team members in total fud mode ü§¶

[09-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Markus#5464
So what does @Bitcoin Benny have to say about the 5 mil by K64 to RFox?

[09-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Buddz1993#5380
geez christ whats been happening

[09-Aug-19 03:43 PM] Buddz1993#5380
fud war now?

[09-Aug-19 03:43 PM] Buddz1993#5380
between ecosystem coins?

[09-Aug-19 03:43 PM] Markus#5464
Honestly i never felt K64 getting anywhere, when i first time watched their live stream it was a joke

[09-Aug-19 03:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
it's bad for the overall image of komodo anyway.

[09-Aug-19 03:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Everyone should clear their heads before making any public announcement tbh

[09-Aug-19 03:45 PM] Buddz1993#5380
because it can really affect us where we most likely don't want to.

[09-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I like K64 , and tbh it's a very recent project and it will take time to develop spreading fud like it has been spread today is bad really bad.

[09-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
for everyone involved

[09-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
RFOX, K64, KMD

[09-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Markus#5464
Its just K64 being idiots hyping over the investment and then doing nothing about it, even the whitepaper to blur things out so silly

[09-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yea but , it makes us look bad in the first place

[09-Aug-19 03:48 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
K64 sounds like classic Eth ico approach

[09-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Markus#5464
Either way im glad for what the kmd team did, they handled it with caution and simply took action

[09-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Ye I'm glad in a way that I keep most of my investment in KMD and a very minor fee in the rest.

[09-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I know what to count for.

[09-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but they got the investment in the first place or not?

[09-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Buddz1993#5380
because it would be  a huge investment for a small company like that.

[09-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Markus#5464
i dont know but reading it was suppose to be goldman sachs then it sounds rly sketchy to me

[09-Aug-19 03:52 PM] Markus#5464
i would understood if goldman sachs would of wanted to invest 78m in KMD, proven working tech and hard working team

[09-Aug-19 03:52 PM] Markus#5464
but thats a totaly different story then

[09-Aug-19 03:54 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I agree..

[09-Aug-19 03:57 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Now that you mentioned it would def make more sense if you see from a multi milion dollar company point of view.

[09-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A bit rough shit going on in k64 chat

[09-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Even though i am sceptical like most of you

[09-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Piling on top of each other not being able to wait to burn it down etc doesnt seem very productive

[09-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just wait for the rest of the day, if gs comes with a press release fine

[09-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If not then a lot of people lost quite a big chunck of cash which also sucks

[09-Aug-19 04:09 PM] Markus#5464
K64 shouldnt even hype it in first place

[09-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Markus#5464
hyping it like that is not very professional

[09-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yea for sure

[09-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Has a bit of carles matos vibes like that
