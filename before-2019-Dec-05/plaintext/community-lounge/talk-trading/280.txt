and anyone running Bitmains ABC will not be mining much after Nov 17th test starts so the solution is simply to switch and mine #BitcoinSV like #Bitmain will have to.  Also all exchanges need to be running SV nodes during this also.

a group perhaps linked to SV has planned a stress-test on 17

What's with the teeny-tiny blocks, @proffaustus, @CalvinAyre, @nChainGlobal?  Scared to go over 32 MB? I thought you guys could mine up to 128 MB!  

Or maybe, just maybe, with SV nodes crashing and stalling, you realize that sustained 128 MB blocks are not yet possible ye...

What are all these extra transactions that SV is mining? What is their purpose?

The ABC side needs to figure out the answer to that question FAST.

Does the streamer work for the bch chain?

[15-Nov-18 09:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder if one of the sides would pay to fill up blocks of the other side 😃

Hey guys why do I get a warning that says one or several of your utxo are not generating rewards?

[16-Nov-18 12:35 AM] Llama#1330
there are a few possible reasons

[16-Nov-18 12:35 AM] BlackJesus#6161
dude bitfcoin cash space is crazy right now

[16-Nov-18 12:37 AM] Vertigo#0439
Weird I do have more than 10kmd and the transactions been there for over 15 days

[16-Nov-18 12:37 AM] Vertigo#0439
Last time I claimed was November 1

@Vertigo  Sent your balance to your own public address ...your locktime might not be set.

Ok I claimed my 4.3kmd and now warning is gone

[16-Nov-18 01:06 AM] meatspoon#7860
I just looked at that too.  I also had a warning even though I last claimed 5 days ago.  It kind of looks like the only portion of my funds that were not generating rewards were the last bit of rewards/interest.  If that is the case, it is kind of confusing to have that warning.  I would call that a bug, low severity, but if it is constantly warning about a portion of one's KMD that by definition is a tiny percentage (less than 1 month's worth of interest), people are going to be claiming rewards more often than they should, paying unnecessary transaction fees.

[16-Nov-18 01:21 AM] Vertigo#0439
I just did that

[16-Nov-18 01:21 AM] Vertigo#0439
Lol

[16-Nov-18 01:27 AM] Vertigo#0439
Ohhh I got it is a silly bug

[16-Nov-18 01:28 AM] Vertigo#0439
Is telling me that I'm not gaining rewards on my unclaimed rewards lol

[16-Nov-18 01:29 AM] Vertigo#0439
As soon as I got a tiny reward again it popped up again

[16-Nov-18 01:41 AM] ryman112#0068
I would assume its only logical to abandon either of the forks of btch.  Why would anyone feel secure with there money invested in such a situation?  And whos to say one of these crazys doesn't do it again in the future?  I would be out and never look back.

If there wasn’t a $ this wouldn’t be happening.  Sad ducks are trying to get/kill as many $cryptos as possible. Avalanche as much as possible.

Bitcoin BCH hash war will be decided by sustained – not temporar...
With the Bitcoin BCH network upgrade on November 15, a hash war has begun with miners voting between Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC – two competing implementations of the BCH protocol.

[16-Nov-18 08:58 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
interesting to see 100$ spread on BCH among CEXes, for example Binance list BCH for 440$ while Bittrex for 360$, there is also kind of split between CEXes

[16-Nov-18 08:59 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

BAB:USD on finex is about 290$, while BSV about 125$

[16-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Don King#8901
ABC using checkpoints and rented hash from BTC pools is a bad move, SV is fighting fair at least

[16-Nov-18 09:08 AM] Mark81#4505

@Don King article comes from coingeek that supports BCHSV

I've been short btc from 7300 and eth from 240, think theres A LOT more downside ahead

[16-Nov-18 09:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
In nature there is no such thing as "fair", but there is sth like "stronger" which survives and this proces we call evolution :pirate:

[16-Nov-18 09:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
also this

[16-Nov-18 09:17 AM] jansako#3330
so what is the expectation? BAB or BSV?

[16-Nov-18 09:35 AM] snowdamn#2414
PSA: it's critical for BTC to go >= $7.5k even if it just stays there for an extended time period (years)
current levels are dangerous and can lead to very unfortunate situations

what kind of unfortunate situations are you referring to?

[16-Nov-18 09:38 AM] snowdamn#2414
$700

[16-Nov-18 09:39 AM] snowdamn#2414
with various stops inbetween, of course

[16-Nov-18 09:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
that could be somewhat entertaining

[16-Nov-18 09:41 AM] snowdamn#2414
me no likey

[16-Nov-18 09:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'd still be ahead

[16-Nov-18 09:44 AM] snowdamn#2414
sector might not survive such outcome

[16-Nov-18 09:44 AM] snowdamn#2414
it's not about our pockets

[16-Nov-18 09:45 AM] snowdamn#2414
we'll end up with a handful of projects, not a thriving sector

[16-Nov-18 09:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
not to be too cynical, but it's mostly overinflated bs now anyway

[16-Nov-18 09:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
there is very little reality, and a lot of smoke and mirrors

[16-Nov-18 09:48 AM] snowdamn#2414
if we go back to investors funding projects with fiat, no good

[16-Nov-18 09:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
the mere fact that a couple of delusional rich guys can have this big of an effect shows how fragile this experiment really is.

[16-Nov-18 09:49 AM] snowdamn#2414
don't get me started with BCH lol 😂

[16-Nov-18 09:49 AM] snowdamn#2414
or Coinbase

[16-Nov-18 10:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It doesnt have the effect. The market would have broken down with this drama or without it.

[16-Nov-18 10:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The thing is that people tend to look for "reasons" when price is not moving their side.

[16-Nov-18 10:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Reasons like "moar marketing"  ,  " because team is anonymous " or my favorite "[insert readily disprovable lie here ]"
