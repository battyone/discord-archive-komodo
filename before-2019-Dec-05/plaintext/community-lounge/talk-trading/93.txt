I never really trusted bitfinex based off that tether and all that manipulation shit people were on about

[10-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Aug-18 12:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
it's good KMD is not on Bitfinex IMO

Binance Offers First Look At Planned Decentralized Crypto Exchange...
Cryptocurrency exchange Binance unveiled the platform's first look at its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) on Thursday.

[10-Aug-18 05:51 PM] Mische#6695
KMD ded

[10-Aug-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
because binance has the equivalent of the CC assets contract to do single chain token issuance and swaps that KMD can also do?

[10-Aug-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the video shows cli commands returning JSON

[10-Aug-18 05:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
can someone save me some time and tell me what the profit model is?

[10-Aug-18 05:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
doesn't make sense a successful exchange would do this

[10-Aug-18 05:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
when you first hear about it

[10-Aug-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
a token based system would need a trusted custodian

[10-Aug-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and using a single blockchain does allow atomic swaps, but all tx are atomic on a single blockchain so it isnt saying much

[10-Aug-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
this is tech from 4 years ago that NXT had, counterparty has, bitshare has

[10-Aug-18 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and also KMD's assets CC contract also does. but binance can divert some percentage of its userbase and jump start trading volumes, but a token based system  requires somebody to hold the coins, so it doesnt change so much if binance is holding the coins

[10-Aug-18 05:59 PM] snowdamn#2414
so the DEX will have fees that go to Binance ?

[10-Aug-18 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
likely they will charge withdraw fees

[10-Aug-18 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and txfees will exist for the chain doing all this, so who knows what the costs end up being, but it could well be less than now

[10-Aug-18 06:01 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok, if they're holding the coins, withdrawal fees, tx fees, and who knows what else, they need to stop calling it a DEX lol üòÄ

[10-Aug-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the NXT/bitshares level of DEX. one step closer to the atomic DEX

[10-Aug-18 06:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'll read more about it when more info is released, but i do like CZ, regardless

[10-Aug-18 06:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
i have done fairly good in crypto, but it does sting a little bit missing out on Binancecoin
