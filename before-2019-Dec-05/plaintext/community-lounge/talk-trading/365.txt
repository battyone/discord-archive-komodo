I think kmd testing support line and after that maybe it will pump

[03-Jan-19 11:59 AM] dokrates#8987
me too

[03-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Likewise#6767
volume has dried up

[03-Jan-19 12:01 PM] Likewise#6767
so no pump just yet

[03-Jan-19 12:07 PM] dokrates#8987
yes, i also saw lot of buys spiking up, but some dumps lowering the price

[03-Jan-19 12:07 PM] dokrates#8987
i think the ask is very dry, so as soon big buys come in, the price will jump hard

[03-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Likewise#6767
I tend to follow volume on binance.

Yen climbs on safe-haven appeal amid China growth fears
The yen rallied against the dollar and euro on Thursday as investors sought the perceived safety of the Japanese currency after a shock revenue warning from Apple Inc exacerbated concerns about a Chinese and global economic slowdown.

Japan´s government is investing in their future...because they are getting old...on proved things...nothing fancy as being a super power like China... just mantaining what they have...

[03-Jan-19 09:55 PM] ver_User#6608
these financial reporting narratives are ludicrous.... especially stuff like this CNBC. Always "reasons" for the moves, like "amid growing fears of xxx" .... The spike had zero to do with considered, cognitive reasons like that, such a waste of time writing or reading that stuff....

Apple reported out of hours, massive spike across many (apparently) related markets due to low liquidity/market closed/gaps on open/mass liquidations, end of story. Ridiculous that the world can literally be pegged to one company, albeit for 5 minutes of stupid algos etc.... as if the stock market = apple, and the stock market = the economy, so economy = apple... what is going on?? markets have become a meme, no reasoning matters anymore. Yen moved on correlation, aussie moved on correlation etc, no actual reason apart from apple IS the stock market, and everything else thinks it's correlated to the american stocks.

Sometimes you have to just laugh at the absurdity of it all. Forcing people to tie their retirement funds to the stock market via 401k is a swindle.

[04-Jan-19 01:56 AM] meatspoon#7860
think about what the market cap of the dow or nasdaq would be if government didnt threaten to steal what people don't contribute to their 401k's...  Government basically says, "I am going to steal X% of your income.  But if you commit to putting some of your income into this walled garden of government-manipulated assets, we will steal less of that portion."  Of course money is going to get shoved into that area.  People aren't buying stocks because they believe in the companies they are investing in.  They buy stocks so less of their money gets jacked by .gov.  Imagine the market cap of any of the indices if government wasn't pointing guns at peoples' heads telling them where to push their money.

I for one hope that dow keeps crashing. The p/e ratio for most fang stocks is still ludicrous. I think a lot of people got pissed at wall st for the banker bailouts. It gave birth to btc. And hopefully they will try that shit again so crypto can gain even more marketshare.

You do know that Apple has lost 452 billion... since October...that's like 4 times the CMC or bigger than Facebook market cap.

I am not an economist but I think somebody is going to get fired...if not multiple people...are going to get fired if a recession do occur. I just hope more people see the crypto market as a way to punish the stock market

[04-Jan-19 02:48 AM] Hermes#6934
I wouldn't see far fetched that in the near future Crypto being adopted by corporations..

[04-Jan-19 02:49 AM] Hermes#6934
to have more transparency and community focused products...I don't think that the millenial generation are fans of the banks or wall street...so it could be positive in making this type of good faith economics corporations...

They expected to sell in big numbers a phone with no headphone jack that costed $1500... they took it too far imo... thought that they could put whatever price and zombies would buy it.

US companies will loose against China copy-paste. Tech inventions are like open source software. Knowledge/invention is easy to copy paste. China much cheaper - got no competition. No other way - western countries must share wealth with poor smart countries like China.

[04-Jan-19 10:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
China is making better things every year, no wonder Apple will lose. Investors already know which country and which shares will grow fastest.

Off topic question : why Komodo trading volume is too much low in the exchanges?? Most volume is in the binance. Before binance People where buying komodo? And why less important projects have so high volume than Komodo?

@Hermes except Gen Z have way more refined ability and tools to get lost in the ephemeral and often useless pursuits (social media and virtual worlds on TV and games), a sweet coping mechanism, better than bitcoin 😉

[04-Jan-19 11:14 AM] ver_User#6608
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 Charlie Munger (who I don't know well or have an opinion on, but heard a great lecture from) basically said that any American company these days with any sense just does not aim to compete with the Chinese. They are too proficient at whatever they put their minds to, better to specialise in something that they cannot copy... Interesting angle from a wise old dude

[04-Jan-19 11:19 AM] ver_User#6608
@mazyar_lp on topic more like.... Bittrex seems to be where most of the trading started, you have a longer historical graph from Bittrex too... other projects probably have higher volume due to more hype/pumping/better marketing/more noobs involved and wash trading bots.

[04-Jan-19 11:20 AM] blubbi#0643
the big difrence is, chinese politics make decission based  on thinkings further as only to next elections year like all western politics do

[04-Jan-19 11:29 AM] blubbi#0643
They copied infrastructure and large scal economics, producing with low costs for 30 years, buying mines, raw materials all over the world for the last 20 years with cheap money ( 98% off all rare earth mines in chinese hands), buyied up so much high tech firms arround the world the last 8 years and now and forcing at the silkroad project, after that they reducing the export of raw materials and goods and starting export the high tech with an new united Eurasia marcet

@mazyar_lp Komodo tends to have many users holding KMD off exchanges.... one of these reasons is because of rewards, the other reason is because we dont have organized pump and dump groups

[04-Jan-19 11:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
BTW, imo KMD will be a top gainer when the next bull run comes. the main reason i believe this other than how ahead we are in innovation is because of the no drama culture.

You can try to justify your stupid logic all you want. You were trying to troubleshoot the problem to recover your funds, that shows desperation not that you found out the issue and warning others. You say there are bad people out there, sure. But there is more to life than blame the victim here.

We live in a world where more and more people have no morals and do not stand for things that they should stand up for.  Blaming people for expecting people to follow the rules and have some common decency is just stupid.

`You were trying to troubleshoot the problem to recover your funds`
That was __prior__ to my understanding what happened and wile trying to figure out if I had a rouge script that I did it with (since I wasn't home at the time it happened)
`We live in a world where more and more people have no morals and do not stand for things that they should stand up for. `
And yet you act like you believe it's all unicorns and rainbows and everyone "follows the rules"
Which is it:
do you understand that "more and more people have no morals"?
or
do you believe that everyone is going to always give credit for code?

You can't have both
because, logic

"We have survived the bear so far with no drama at all.

[04-Jan-19 12:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
1. Spend your own money hiring devs to make a program to solve a big problem for the community and get raise some funds to continue investing in dev hours
2. Have the code open source to make sure that it is secure and there are no bugs
3. Spend countless hours troubleshooting with jl777 
4. Have someone STEAL the code and claim that they have done it first
5. Call out this bad behavior and get blamed for trying to help the community.

Now you tell me @blackjok3r how would you fucking feel if this happened to you? You are investing in a platform that people are blaming you for trying to help?
