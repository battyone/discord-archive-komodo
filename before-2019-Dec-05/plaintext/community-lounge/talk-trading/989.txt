without marketing

[01-Aug-19 02:35 PM] Caglio#3337
I cannot, I went dead on shitcoin marketing kmd coin

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Idk why so many people here pretend marketing isn‚Äôt important.  How the hell will we get ‚Äúmass adoption‚Äù without the masses knowing about Komodo...

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Marketing is # 1 for sure

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Caglio#3337
@grumpygoron cos they are delusional morons

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Sdunbar#5064

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Caglio#3337
Like freddy kruger

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Sdunbar#5064
many great products have surely died without it

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] grumpygoron#4320
We have a product now...why isn‚Äôt marketing in the spotlight of importance

[01-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I suspect KMD may one day run out of money anyways at this rate

[01-Aug-19 02:37 PM] actionslacks#4072
throw money at what, increasing the rank on a results board at a horse track? it's all lies and bullshit. ALL of it. fuck partnerships that lead to nowhere. And fuck all the stupid vaporware moon boy circle jerks. you wanna get in the pump party then go. see how much faster you lose your money.

[01-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Caglio#3337
Money ? We do have money ? I thought we cannot afford it

[01-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Caglio#3337
We afforded plagiarized logo tho

[01-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks we are dead coin anyway

[01-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Caglio#3337
No marketing, no future

[01-Aug-19 02:38 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@actionslacks I don‚Äôt care about the rankings I care about a marketing team doing their job of marketing the tech we have.  There are so many talking points that set Komodo apart.  They need to push that shit out there like crazy now

[01-Aug-19 02:38 PM] Caglio#3337
But they made amazing web page

[01-Aug-19 02:38 PM] Caglio#3337
Too bad noone cares about that webpage

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Like really noone, except few nerds on discord

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Caglio#3337
It took them only year and half to rebrand

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Caglio#3337
What an amazing job

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
We late

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Missed 2017

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] grumpygoron#4320
A website without marketing is a billboard on a dirt road, hardly anyone sees it except those who use that road.  Marketing is meant to get that ‚Äúbillboard‚Äù on a highway

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Caglio#3337
If they had 5 more years

[01-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Caglio#3337
Maybe something would happen

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio they have

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 they do shit, they are worthless

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But y not the patience to see it trough

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Yeah I suspect money will be a problem in a major way eventually if the price never increases

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Sdunbar#5064
gotta pay the team

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Sdunbar#5064
not sure where money will be generated from

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lol outta here

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Caglio#3337
Price is just going down

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[01-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hands down sry for saying it , you will always stay poor no matter what , even when kmd moons

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
You are a poor brainlet

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Dont oyu think I should invest more in kmd then ?

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Probably drunk

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not drunk üò¶

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio I think you should sell it

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Stop coming here

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
And go in mental institution

[01-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
But then I will miss all those talks about top 10 coin

[01-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Dont you maybe thing you should stop being delusional about ur shit coin that do shit except losing value over tiem ?

[01-Aug-19 02:42 PM] dan.#2473
kmd could still moon via USD

[01-Aug-19 02:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio for one to loose money in this ,. Someone gains you brainfart

[01-Aug-19 02:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Zero sum game etc

[01-Aug-19 02:43 PM] dan.#2473
but if you been in this space a while and know a lot of crypto, take a look at the top 300 coin charts, .... things change fast

[01-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Ofc someone who sold you kmd

[01-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Caglio#3337
that one won

[01-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Caglio#3337
cos its getting worthless day after day

[01-Aug-19 02:43 PM] grumpygoron#4320
With how low things are it‚Äôs not likely those who are selling are profiting much at all if any.  Most likely exiting KMD

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Well if bear season starts once again

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Yeah nothin much has changed in some ways over 2 years with this coin. Still get like 25-100 retweets max on twitter

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
we are going to 10 cents

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Sdunbar#5064
extremely low engagement

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Noone cares about it, but we dont need marketing

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
We need "rebrand"

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
a whole web page

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Whata amazing job

[01-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
God

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Caglio#3337
If roger ver just thought of it

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 buy more bro

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Caglio#3337
its bargain

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Caglio#3337
whats a 1$ for such amazing coin you can use for nothing

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] dan.#2473
crypto speculation != stock speculation. You can hold a stock for years, and theres a good chance it does well. The crypto numbers don't get better every year necessarily. And quite frankly, most cryptos dont have a value use case

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio allin usdc

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Literally own 60 kmd

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
the people making money investing in alts now are trading on information you dont have and talking to people you dont know. kmd hasn't kissed the ring of wall st and likely never will.

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Convert ur usdc into kmd

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ofc not

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] dan.#2473
@Caglio is blunt but I agree. marketing team is clueless. you dont just build a web page and call it a day

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Caglio#3337
@dan. exactly, whats rebranding in a whole rebrand ?

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Caglio#3337
they changed logo ( stolen it )

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Caglio#3337
thats all üòÑ

[01-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Caglio#3337
whata amazing rebrand ( :

[01-Aug-19 02:48 PM] Caglio#3337
clap clap

[01-Aug-19 02:48 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh yeah, web page, imagine that, we have a web page in 2019

[01-Aug-19 02:48 PM] Caglio#3337
Pioneers

[01-Aug-19 02:48 PM] dan.#2473
theres 2k other cryptos out there. CMC rankings are all about popularity. If popularity is KMD's goal, then the rebrand was a fail
