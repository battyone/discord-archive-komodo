A new vulnerability fundamentally breaks zerocoin security. Watch out for any zerocoin related announcements in the next few days. Don't trade OTC. PIVX, VEIL, ZCOIN and many more projects affected. It's estimated that this can't be fixed.

you mean the zcoin that used 3 year old tech at the time zcash was done and abandoned by professor green as being experimental proof of concept?

look on binance BTC markets

[26-Apr-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
-6% is middle of pack.

[26-Apr-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is best to turn off the charts until BTC is back above $10k

[26-Apr-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
by then all this "has the bear market really ended" talk will be gone

[26-Apr-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and KMD will be back to ICO price of 10k sats

[26-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe up toward 100k sats

[26-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i would say 90% chance somewhere in between

[26-Apr-19 07:14 PM] coingirl87#6489

[26-Apr-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
its just bots pushing the price down as i described the other day

[26-Apr-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
77 BTC is probably half the bots trading to themselves to push the price down

[26-Apr-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
get people to panic sell at the lower price

[26-Apr-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
more profits that way

[26-Apr-19 07:19 PM] crumb#2550
@coingirl87 stop being a drama queen and accept the fact that the whole crypto space is highly irrational. perhaps you should reduce your exposure if you get upset so easily

[26-Apr-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont have any market operations to fiddle with the market price so these marketmaker bots do the pushing the price down

[26-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
do you understand that there are people that sacrifice some BTC to push the price down, in order to buy at even lower prices?

[26-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
that very few people are actually selling

[26-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that KMD only has about 100 million coins, a lot of coins that have disproportionate marketcap have billions and billions

[26-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
that makes each coin cheap

[26-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and believe it or not a lot of people trade based on "hey its only 100 sats, it must be a good deal" type of logic
