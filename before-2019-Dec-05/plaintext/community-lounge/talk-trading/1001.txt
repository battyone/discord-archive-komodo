adaptivepow helps chains that are 100% minable. imagine if KMDICE chain is being mined by only CPU, diff is low for that and suddenly a big miner comes in with a lot of hash to mine some blocks quickly and goes for mining another chain. KMDICE would be left with very high diff and normal CPU miners will have to try for a year with CPU to get the next block. adaptivepow helps in this scenerio to mine a block with CPU within 10-15 after the big ASIC miner left the chain.

protip: don't use on-demand chains

[03-Aug-19 11:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[03-Aug-19 11:24 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

We need leveraged shorting for Komodo

[03-Aug-19 11:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Get bitmex to list it and let‚Äôs beat this bitch into the ground and get rich doing it

[03-Aug-19 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
it's possible that adaptive pow will solve all of the problems, but as of right now, on-demand chains are not a good option

[03-Aug-19 11:37 PM] p.#1126

China Could Be About To Throw Its Weight Behind Bitcoin
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have had a tumultuous relationship with China over the last few years, with crypto trading volume notoriously difficult to measure since the country banned exchanges in 2017.

I remember being warned about this behavior in a proverb as a young lad and this is how it goes IIRC

[04-Aug-19 12:26 AM] JimD#9272
Me Chinese, me play joke, me go peepee in your coke.  If you cry I don't care Ill pull down your underwear

[04-Aug-19 12:27 AM] JimD#9272
So I do believe most of use were warned in advance of the unscrupulous behavior we can expect from the Chinese

[04-Aug-19 12:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
All this positive Bitcoin news suddenly should warn you of incoming huge dump .

[04-Aug-19 12:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Screen cap this pls

[04-Aug-19 12:28 AM] JimD#9272

[04-Aug-19 12:29 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 12:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 12:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Many buy 8.5

[04-Aug-19 12:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
And I think most

[04-Aug-19 12:30 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, seems to be all the crypto channels are saying to buy now but Im not sure

[04-Aug-19 12:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
They will Al get rekt possibly

[04-Aug-19 12:30 AM] JimD#9272
might just buy more KMD since it seems to be a good deal ATM

[04-Aug-19 12:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Agreed

[04-Aug-19 12:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
But I will after the crash that I think is coming

[04-Aug-19 12:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Don't need rekt USD value

[04-Aug-19 12:31 AM] JimD#9272
Yup, Im happy to build up some cash.  I don't need to be fully invested ATM

[04-Aug-19 12:33 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
I really suspicious all this libra shit, and all this company's declaring using blockchain

[04-Aug-19 12:33 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
They forget blockchain and crypto currency is a diffrence

[04-Aug-19 12:33 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, Libra could really be the strawman they use to regulate everything

[04-Aug-19 12:33 AM] JimD#9272
or at least lock up the CEXs

[04-Aug-19 12:33 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Nobody of those will buy into btc , owned by what 5 big mining conglomerates

[04-Aug-19 12:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@JimD yes agree

[04-Aug-19 12:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Already read today

[04-Aug-19 12:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Libra might not be coming

[04-Aug-19 12:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 12:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Might be building precendence

[04-Aug-19 12:34 AM] JimD#9272
I don't think it can work because it is too centralized anyway

[04-Aug-19 12:35 AM] JimD#9272
there have been earlier attempts of alternate currencies that failed because the FED just came and raided the office

[04-Aug-19 12:35 AM] JimD#9272
BTC is powerfull because they can't really attack it at any one point

[04-Aug-19 12:35 AM] JimD#9272
but they sure as hell are sending the IRS after the BTC HODLers

[04-Aug-19 12:35 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes but still it's controlled by few

[04-Aug-19 12:35 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's not so decentralized as many claim

[04-Aug-19 12:36 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Quite the opposite

[04-Aug-19 12:36 AM] JimD#9272
The mining is but the network would stay up even if those miners shut down

[04-Aug-19 12:37 AM] JimD#9272
it has a very elastic nature even if it was in a more degraded state because high hash mining operations shut down

[04-Aug-19 12:47 AM] p.#1126
Kmd to 7k?

[04-Aug-19 12:50 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
