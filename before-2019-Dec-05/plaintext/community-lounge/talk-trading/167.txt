🚨SEC has postponed SolidX ETF Decision

[20-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Meh was totally expected tbh

[20-Sep-18 08:53 PM] WhiteWidow#8771

Big fat buy order on binance

[20-Sep-18 11:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Does the SEC actually do any work.. at all?

[20-Sep-18 11:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or is it just a government-funded extortion racket

[20-Sep-18 11:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Government, a guy with a gun demanding something

[20-Sep-18 11:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you’ve ever wondered why I hate leftists, it’s because they want more of that shit

[20-Sep-18 11:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They hunt down fraudsters.  But that's little solace .

[20-Sep-18 11:53 PM] bishop#9773
"hunt" is a bit of an overstatement

[20-Sep-18 11:57 PM] Markus#5464

[21-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
that calculates when to claim and how to maximise kmd claiming daily vs weekly vs monthly etc

[21-Sep-18 01:41 AM] yorklab#7270
It appears to be down.

[21-Sep-18 03:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
SEC is there solely to keep the little guy from getting the big guy’s cut. Same deal with DEA, ATF, DHS. the whole alphabet soup.

[21-Sep-18 03:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
Silk road was their worst nightmare. Ross Ulbricht was made an unfortunate example of what happens when you into banking cartel profits.

“Who else will run the register at 7-11?  No investing for you, plebe”

[21-Sep-18 03:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
I hope the SEC stays the fuck away from crypto forever. It doesn’t belong on wall st anyway because it’s not fake.

[21-Sep-18 03:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
😆

[21-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just need to get the IRS to do the same thing

[21-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
No soup for you

[21-Sep-18 03:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
I love the IRS. They are our benevolent overlords, and are just trying to help.

What if these sec guys are still loading bags, at this point nobody expects them to allow anything. So when they approve an etf out of the blue, imagine the explosion btc will do...

Wtf is going on with cRipple?

[21-Sep-18 08:45 AM] zatJUM#9924

[21-Sep-18 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
gate.io has 100 BTC withdraw limit without KYC

[21-Sep-18 08:53 AM] Alright#0419
I'm always weary of people trying to OTC when they have other options

[21-Sep-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
especially if they are offering a 10% discount 😉

[21-Sep-18 09:12 AM] zatJUM#9924
that's the price one wants to pay if he doesn't want to fill kyc 😉

[21-Sep-18 09:13 AM] zatJUM#9924
I'll do the post xtz-ico kyc and sell on gate.io (I didn't know that one). Thanks Alright for your suggestion

[21-Sep-18 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'm always weary of people trying to OTC when they have other options`
Says the guy that's been trying to OTC CoinX for like "forever" now :trollface:

[21-Sep-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I only KYC with people I “know”

[21-Sep-18 10:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
How much I really “know” anyone in here, or vice versa, is relative of course

[21-Sep-18 10:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
I only give blood for identity verification

[21-Sep-18 10:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Let’s just say I haven’t been hanging around since 2015 to steal a few hundred $ worth of OTC trade to run off and start a new life for myself

[21-Sep-18 10:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
There’s that angle

[21-Sep-18 10:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah, too bad you sold NEM

[21-Sep-18 10:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Deleted User can vouch, even if I can’t get shit to work for an hour or two :abusedsmily:

[21-Sep-18 10:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Not saying *you* would, but I've seen people ruin longer relationships on the internet for less $.

[21-Sep-18 10:54 AM] Alright#0419
most of it is money orders or cash in mail

[21-Sep-18 10:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
that one btc I sold last summer for 1600 still stings a little

_remembers back when post-dating a check was meaningful_

[21-Sep-18 10:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
I still use checks and the millenials are perplexed by it

[21-Sep-18 10:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
go to a grocery store and write a check

"back in my day... we didn't pay transaction fees"

[21-Sep-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I still use checks and the millenials are perplexed by it`
millenials are perplexed by giving them $20.01 for something that totals $19.76, so there's that...

[21-Sep-18 10:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
oh yeah.. the math thing. tax dollars at work

[21-Sep-18 11:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm optimistic though

[21-Sep-18 11:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
This too shall pass

Shit, just larping, I'm a millenial

[21-Sep-18 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is far enough removed from being a millennial that he only knows what "larping" is because he seen it discussed on an episode of CSI once..._
