[29-Oct-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but this level tech does take years to do

[29-Oct-19 12:58 PM] Flint#6435
different counterparties can act as suppliers with an incentive if they have blocked funds they have no incentive to play against and as oracles develop based on AI technologies that continuously add new data to smart contracts changing the contract itself as it is in the QTUM project, but in practice it will not be easy yet

[29-Oct-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
can you stop repeating things about flawed oracles

[29-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Privatoshi#9487
All of the mechanisms needed for a decentralized gaming is crazy

[29-Oct-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
please read about the DTO that avoids all this locking of funds, reputation, etc.

[29-Oct-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the chain simply requires consensus on the price to generate the next block and all nodes validate the prices, similar to timestamps

[29-Oct-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there is not need for the super complex aggregated oracles that probably will have some design or implementation problems

[29-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Since we are delving into decentralized gaming and into USDk and cc-peg, how about cc-predictions?

[29-Oct-19 01:01 PM] Flint#6435
the betting market is generally trillions of dollars and where there is a lot of money there are incentives for developers

[29-Oct-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
@Privatoshi the realtime aspect makes it quite difficult indeed, you basically need to make what is effectively a custom blockchain for each table

[29-Oct-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
cc-predictions about what?

[29-Oct-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
prices CC can do prediction based bets on prices for crypto, fiat, commodities, metals, stocks, basically anything you can make a DTO with

[29-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I have followed DAOCasino for a long time now, I have seen what they've gone through, just to get to their first testnet

[29-Oct-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but we dont have any gui for it, so people pretend it doesnt exist

[29-Oct-19 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can we mentally masturbate about one development at the time?

[29-Oct-19 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We started full on Pegs testing

[29-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Flint#6435
I'm in context DTO

[29-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Prediction markets, for like Champions League Soccer. But yes, you're right   @siu - Chainmakers

[29-Oct-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
find a freely accesible internet feed for X, a DTO can be made for X

[29-Oct-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
once there is a DTO, you can bet on it

[29-Oct-19 01:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in a few months we will have not only USD pegged stable coin, but GOLD, some other commodities, and even stocks or other cryptos like btc

[29-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Great work JL

[29-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Privatoshi#9487
@siu - Chainmakers I've been lurking in cc-pegs.. I know what's up

[29-Oct-19 01:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
pegged coins that will be exchangeable in atomicdex

[29-Oct-19 01:04 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I like this one

[29-Oct-19 01:04 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Synthetic Assets

[29-Oct-19 01:04 PM] Privatoshi#9487
And USDk

[29-Oct-19 01:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
remember that each pegged coin will need KMD underneath to get value, so it will generate demand for KMD

[29-Oct-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the DTO is setup to be able to define a synthetic price as any nested combination of an existing pricefeed

[29-Oct-19 01:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which is a topic that many people criticize about KMD

[29-Oct-19 01:05 PM] Flint#6435
What basket of fiat currencies is still planned? Yuan would be nice to add franc

[29-Oct-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
you can even make an index and peg to that

[29-Oct-19 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[29-Oct-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
millions of different pegs are possible

[29-Oct-19 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
heheh

[29-Oct-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
we will only do a handful to demonstrate how to do it

[29-Oct-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is a matter of a different command line to create a new pegged chain, and running the nodes and dapp

[29-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c   where is the most comprehensive information to read about DTO?

[29-Oct-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so once it is well documented, anybody would be able to make a pegged chain

[29-Oct-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
@Flint all you need to know is in my blog post

[29-Oct-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it was less than 1000 lines of code, i guess you can read the code too

[29-Oct-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
DTO is a building block, it provides a consensus pricefeed

[29-Oct-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
out of N of those, you can create a synthetic price

[29-Oct-19 01:08 PM] Flint#6435
ok - thanks

[29-Oct-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
"KMD_BTC,BTC_USD,XAU_USD,**/,1"

[29-Oct-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
that combines the three DTO pricefeeds  KMD_BTC, BTC_USD and XAU_USD into XAU/KMD synthetic price

[29-Oct-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and the peg is to that synthetic price, backed by the value of the KMD deposited to back the issuing of the stablecoin

[29-Oct-19 01:11 PM] Flint#6435
clearly you show an example of creating and binding and then it‚Äôs up to the investigators of the instruction

[29-Oct-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, change the XAU_USD in the above into XYZ_USD price and you have a synthetic price of XYZ in terms of KMD, which can then be used for the pegged and backed chain

[29-Oct-19 01:12 PM] Flint#6435
Yes, in this case, demand will increase without any taxes

[29-Oct-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as there are use cases for these pegged chains, yes, KMD demand will be proportional to the amount that wants to be transmuted to different form

[29-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Flint#6435
But please remind me how much today the average inflation is up to cutting the block reward? and how will the cutback of rewards affect deposit?

[29-Oct-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the atomicDEX creates a lot of automatic demand and i think a well done mobile poker dapp will also drive a lot of demand. when people get the fever to play poker and you say they need to deposit X amount of KMD to get their playing chips, most will accept this

[29-Oct-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
inflation is about 5% per year, not sure that has much effect

[29-Oct-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
dont understand what you mean about cutting the block reward

[29-Oct-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
block reward is 3KMD for next 10 years

[29-Oct-19 01:15 PM] Flint#6435
for these synthetic assets will stress tests be needed soon too?

[29-Oct-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
for poker it will need a stress test, but the pegged chains are purely blockchain so it wont really need any specific stress test

[29-Oct-19 01:17 PM] Flint#6435
I realized that the effect of inflation is not significant

[29-Oct-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0137% per day likely has zero effect when people want chips to play poker with

[29-Oct-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the USDk coins dont need to be created by the poker player, they would just get it via atomicDEX, but all the USDk that is in demand will create the demand for others to create the USDk as it will likely trade at a slight premium if there is a shortage

[29-Oct-19 01:20 PM] Flint#6435
since we are talking about poker - how is it with projets like K64 and are there any other people interested in using our chain in traditional gaming consoles for example? And then there is very little information on progress in this area - because it is also extremely useful for the project - it is a very good and undervalued market!

[29-Oct-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
K64 i dont think is around anymore

[29-Oct-19 01:22 PM] Flint#6435
need more impeccable pokers GUI for mass adoption

[29-Oct-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS discord has people testing poker gui

[29-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Flint#6435
ok thanks for the informative conversation I‚Äôll go to consider DTO

[29-Oct-19 02:00 PM] willofleo#7505
@jl777c c who holds the peg and how is it verified

[29-Oct-19 02:00 PM] willofleo#7505
and interest will go to peg holder I am guess

[29-Oct-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean by "holds the peg"?

[29-Oct-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the pegged price conversion is via DTO pricefeed -> synthetic price via blockchain

[29-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Neko#5830
@jl777c sounding like Satoshi with decentralized poker

[29-Oct-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no interest charged with the peg

[29-Oct-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
decentralized poker needed a totally new way of dealing cards, i used a modified form of coinshuffle

[29-Oct-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
sped up by using curve25519 primitives directly

[29-Oct-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
betting in stablecoin puts a known reference at stake and seems the best thing to bet

[29-Oct-19 03:00 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I did some reading last night, on DaoCasino. And coincidentally,  it explained every programmable action that takes place by the dealer, over a few hands of blackjack. It's so much.

lol, how times have changed. I remember when poloniex was the binance of earlier yrs. only if their support team wasn't so terrible, they might still have been players in this current times. I had a support ticket that took 11 months to get a reply and 12 and a half months to resolve. That a good majority of my trading funds locked up for 1yr cos they fucked up.

very good. if you earn some fiat from some sources already, buying crypto is the only best investment you can do right now.

if not, the best only you can do is NOT selling any crypto.

BREAKING 

Local Guangzhou gov just announced a 10B RMB (~$150M USD) government funding dedicated in "blockchain subsidy" for "outstanding blockchain projects"  

More details below 

I believe all other local govs will follow, overall capital subsidy can be massive
