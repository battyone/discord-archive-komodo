It does not have a fast marketmaker by the way, Binance now 9460 sats, Bilaxy 9340 sats

[10-Nov-19 02:22 PM] Neko#5830
still bellow pre rebrand pump

[10-Nov-19 02:35 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Road to 10K sats is pretty clear again, last night there were a lot more sell orders up to 10K.

@ZUL  What price can that ad have?  How much has something raised in Ico?  How long can they maintain that strategy?

[10-Nov-19 02:44 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Ill take volume based on tech, real working project over what basically is bought short term interest/volume

[10-Nov-19 02:46 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Imagine the negative effect when people come to understand their coin is not doing so well as advertised. Not only they sell (or maybe hodl to get breakeven and then sell) the negative impact is even bigger (telling friends about it and sorts). Eventually the real projects will arise, and my best guess is that KMD will be one of those.

[10-Nov-19 02:47 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Burning money to buy TV time is stupid in my opinion. If your project is good enough, the media will eventually give you free airtime on a programme and not in the TV-break.

[10-Nov-19 02:49 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Short terms gains (to keep hodlers happy) is a red flag in general. That means no long term vision and lack of trust in their own product/skills

[10-Nov-19 02:50 PM] CoinKing88#1540
In many project we see a very slow exit strategy happening right now, portions of locked coins getting sold in a slow manner to keep prices stable.

[10-Nov-19 04:36 PM] ZUL#5637
@costa2439 don't know how much, these depend on time on screen, how many times it airs, what time slots it airs, what time of the year it airs, and finally how much it cost to produce the commercial. I would say probably around 100k? Don't know

[10-Nov-19 04:42 PM] ZUL#5637
@CoinKing88 that's the same logic of the "if you build it, they will come" and in the real world, outside of the coding niches, doesn't really work. That's why they hired Benny a while back.... to give KMD some visibility outside the usual market niches. Now, depending on the KMD strategy (that I know nothing about), at some point in time advertising will be needed, either by tv, specialized press articles, social media or whatever media is the best to target the desired market

[10-Nov-19 07:34 PM] richardt#2807
The issue with KMD is they didn't raise much during the ICO, so funds/resources are pretty limited. The next best step is to have significant revenue flowing in from the products (AtomicDEX, Antara, etc.).  This is what's being worked on, but it remains to be seen if enough revenue will flow in

[10-Nov-19 07:37 PM] nocturnal#2177
blockchain application seem largely restricted to finance

[10-Nov-19 07:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
so not much to advertise unless its as an investment

[10-Nov-19 07:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
but its future as an invetment is pegged to blockchain havng application outside of finance

[10-Nov-19 07:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
catch 22

[10-Nov-19 07:40 PM] nocturnal#2177
for the time being anyway

[10-Nov-19 08:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@richardt unless im mistaken, ico funds are mostly used for btc notarizations for the coming xx years 🙂

[10-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dev funds come from other places I think

[10-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont quote me on that though

[10-Nov-19 08:17 PM] CoinKing88#1540
He means compared to something like EOS, the KMD ICO brought a relative low amount of money.

[10-Nov-19 08:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How much did EOS actually raise though. There are suspicions that they used ico funds to buy coins in the open market to pump/boost price

[10-Nov-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So what the net amount raised is is unclear

4.1 billion

[10-Nov-19 08:26 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Ah oke did not hear about that one. Makes sense though, everything Dan Larimer (don't know if i spell it right) does smells fishy.

[10-Nov-19 08:34 PM] CoinKing88#1540
EOS will end just like his other projects Steem and Bitshares

[10-Nov-19 09:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Jep

[10-Nov-19 09:34 PM] richardt#2807
@Cryptoon what other funds do you think there is?

[10-Nov-19 09:35 PM] richardt#2807
Developing and Marketing costs alot of money

[10-Nov-19 09:37 PM] richardt#2807
I think the team is likely only willing to work for little pay or for free for so long. And I wouldn't blame them

[10-Nov-19 09:40 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
last time I checked I thought Komodo was well funded

[10-Nov-19 09:42 PM] crumb#2550
well funded, yes. for development that is.

[10-Nov-19 09:43 PM] crumb#2550
tv spots for komodo just sound totally ridiculous

[10-Nov-19 09:43 PM] richardt#2807
That's pretty much just for the devs who are currently working on KMD. In order to bring in more devs for sustained periods of time, that's a different story

[10-Nov-19 09:44 PM] richardt#2807
And then not including marketing, etc.

[10-Nov-19 09:44 PM] richardt#2807
Ultimately, KMD will need to bring in revenue

[10-Nov-19 09:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[10-Nov-19 09:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Revenue generation is being worked on

[10-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@richardt best to ask in #ask-jl777 but I believe supernet is also funding some stuff

[10-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And not SuperNET the asset/fund

[10-Nov-19 09:57 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
what's the best wallet for Pirate? every time I open agama I have to reindex for pirate to work .... is there something I'm missing in the .conf file?

[10-Nov-19 09:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I use verus agama

[10-Nov-19 09:57 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
that's what I'm using

[10-Nov-19 09:57 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I get error trying to sync only way it works is if I reindex

[10-Nov-19 09:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last version?

[10-Nov-19 09:57 PM] richardt#2807
If I'm not mistaken, supernet just funds itself and holds it.  Not for development

[10-Nov-19 09:58 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
5.9.2

[10-Nov-19 09:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Never had that problem... best to ask in support and ping oink

[10-Nov-19 09:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@richardt as i said not the asset

[10-Nov-19 09:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There is more to supernet than just the supernet/unity asset

[10-Nov-19 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But as I said... dont understand everything muself

[10-Nov-19 10:00 PM] Jimm B.#9993

```On November 11, Chuangshi Capital announced that it will complete the multi-
million RMB increase in Komodo (KMD)
at the second level to support its ecology. Construction and development.``` google translated

[11-Nov-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it does seem the theory that chinese money is flowing into KMD, is confirmed

[11-Nov-19 09:58 AM] willofleo#7505
Interesting is this legit?, and do they plan to invest purely in KMD or KMD and it project  @jl777c

[11-Nov-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it does appear legit, i am not sure the exact meaning of the statement as it is a google translate of that post. Chuangshi Capital appears to be an investment fund, but again not sure, maybe people here can do a bit of research and report back

[11-Nov-19 10:05 AM] jspook16#3059
Wow

[11-Nov-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
for those that concluded the recent price increase was just the ordinary price action, it seems this contraindicates that as a large influx of funds from china into kmd is not ordinary

[11-Nov-19 10:07 AM] jspook16#3059
That is awesome news.

Either way, this is some great news, the theory of natural attraction of chinese market to kmd because of its malleability

[11-Nov-19 11:39 AM] Neko#5830
multi-million investiment in kmd

[11-Nov-19 11:40 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
6 mil RMB ~ 1 mil KMD

[11-Nov-19 11:40 AM] Neko#5830
this is huge

[11-Nov-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
its only about 100 BTC

[11-Nov-19 11:42 AM] Mark81#4505
Is that investment to development or to coin itself?

[11-Nov-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is from that single vc, on bilaxy the KMD market is fourth highest volume

[11-Nov-19 11:42 AM] Neko#5830
the coin to boost development

[11-Nov-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
their theory is that a higher KMD price helps development. i can confirm that it does

[11-Nov-19 11:43 AM] Neko#5830
and it leads to good marketing wich creates a positive circle

[11-Nov-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so here we have another way that KMD creates demand for KMD, to allow chinese vc to help the development and ecosystem with a 100 BTC purchase in the open market

[11-Nov-19 11:44 AM] jeezy#3408

keep in mind this is an unconfirmed story, but it is in two chinese press websites. not that being mentioned in the press is any proof. however, recent market volumes did happen.
