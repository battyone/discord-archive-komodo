[20-Jun-19 09:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I agree

[20-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jansako#3330
now if a bunch of holders/traders are doing the same thing (not necessarily coordinating in person, just on painting the right TA patterns...)

[20-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jansako#3330
yes there are cycles, like with every coin/kommodity/economy you name it

[20-Jun-19 09:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe it is just me since i cannot see how people can sell the coin at such low valuations clouding my judgement but even if it pumps i would question why

[20-Jun-19 09:29 AM] jansako#3330
hard to resist the 'rebuy lower' opportunity when you sen the cycle a few times

[20-Jun-19 09:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
True

[20-Jun-19 09:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But going back to what Grewal has said, the ecosystem coins are always going to have a price relationship with KMD and what its relationship is with BTC

[20-Jun-19 09:32 AM] jansako#3330
I thought he was arguing the opposite, that they do not... of course the 'jl-coins/assets' certainly do, the more independent ones not as much

[20-Jun-19 09:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think at the end of the day, there is a bond and that cant be broken unless a project gains greater liquidity than KMD

[20-Jun-19 09:33 AM] jansako#3330
in which case I think it would be pulling KMD along

[20-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jansako#3330
as long as the tech is flowing down from KMD to 'smartchain' (see how good I am at picking up the new buzzwords :-)), they will remain interconnected. KMD may become the smaller brother one day though.

[20-Jun-19 09:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes i agree with that. I dont think there is going to be the ecosystem coin adoption without KMD coming along for the ride

[20-Jun-19 09:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was arguing that ecosystem are not necessarily pegged to KMD, but since they emerged from KMD itself, just a psychological thought I guess traders might have that it is pegged KMD, and for the better chance of having KMD pairs for those KMD ecosystem projects, which affects that thought.

[20-Jun-19 09:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
example, when I first bought PIRATE, I had no option to buy those with BTC, not much traders, I bought using KMD.
Now it's on exchanges, I don't think it matters if it's in BTC or KMD, I also bought it with BTC

[20-Jun-19 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that personal experience of mine is saying it is unlocking itself from the value pegged mindset to just KMD

[20-Jun-19 09:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just look at ARRR for example, the BTC price influences the KMD pair price as the markets arb any premiums any side would have. So if i can buy with BTC and can sell it for KMD then KMD to BTC and make a profit, the market will.

[20-Jun-19 09:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So there is this kind of sell and buy pressure from the ecosystem coins

[20-Jun-19 09:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If i can buy KMD and then KMD to ARRR then sell to ARRR/BTC and make a profit, someone probably will

[20-Jun-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yea, there is sometimes arb opportunity with the prices of KMD and BTC base pairs to X other ecosystem project coin pair :abusedsmily:

[20-Jun-19 09:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So in that respect, there is always a relationship between the 2 ðŸ˜›

[20-Jun-19 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in that sense it also had relation with ZEC ðŸ˜‚

[20-Jun-19 09:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think like most coins, the ecosystem coins price is tied to BTC once they have sufficient price discovery and liquidity. But they will always have another KMD pair to price their coin in and there will always be market makers that pumps or dumps depending where the free money is

[20-Jun-19 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz I did convert direct from ZEC to KMD to buy some PIRATE ðŸ˜„

[20-Jun-19 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
instead of ZEC to BTC to PIRATE

[20-Jun-19 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz that KMD route was cheaper

[20-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Malti#3948
and faster to transfer to DP prolly

[20-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Malti#3948

[20-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Malti#3948
when you buy arrr

[20-Jun-19 11:33 AM] Markus#5464
i think we will have to let btc moon first then dump and then start to consolidate then alt season can begin

[20-Jun-19 11:33 AM] Markus#5464
i think this is a pre halvening rally for bitcoin

[20-Jun-19 11:34 AM] Markus#5464
and there was just 20 ma crossing 50ma on weekly on btc chart so i expect it to bring a significant pump

[20-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
tdammn

[20-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Markus#5464
There is also litecoin halvening pretty close

[20-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Markus#5464
and btc tend to pump if litecoin pump

[20-Jun-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want to dump KMD for whatever reason, i am in the market to buy OTC at current prices, but only for largish amounts. no time for small trades

[20-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@Malti it always helps the more exposure the better. Unless it's a shady exchange.

[20-Jun-19 12:04 PM] Sherdogz#6731
If you haven't sold at 17 or 18 you muat be stupid to sell at this stage.

[20-Jun-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i make no insult to your intelligence!

[20-Jun-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it could drop to 10k sats, better to sell now and buy back lower!!

[20-Jun-19 12:05 PM] Markus#5464
ofc its possible

[20-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Sherdogz#6731
I was talking in general it could get lower ofc but risk reward isn't worth it. But for others it maybe.

[20-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody?

[20-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
I can buy on binance and sell u 10% over market price :troll_king:

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜„ 

[20-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Malti#3948
in order to buy what jl want's to buy i think you would need to buy up quite some of the binance order book

[20-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Malti#3948
bumping the price up

[20-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Malti#3948
so there goes your 10% profit already

[20-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Markus#5464
np if i bump up price to 20k i add 10% on that price :troll_lol:

[20-Jun-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i said at market price

[20-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Malti#3948
WTB KMD @ 0.00000777 BTC

[20-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Malti#3948

[20-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Sherdogz#6731
If is see JL offering to buy i immediately think dont sell reverse psychology? ðŸ˜„

[20-Jun-19 12:17 PM] p.#1126
Yea seems like a good bluff, now dump af

[20-Jun-19 12:17 PM] p.#1126
9k sats

[20-Jun-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i just dont mind buying at market bottoms +/-

[20-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Markus#5464
U seem pretty confident that price will go up alot?

[20-Jun-19 12:19 PM] p.#1126
Or selling in half mil chunks at atime :3040_suspepe:

[20-Jun-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i see what you see

[20-Jun-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like James, I'm confident that KMD value will go up, as more projects joins the ecosystem.

[20-Jun-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it drops to 15k and then goes up from there

[20-Jun-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I just lack liquidity to buy any new KMD ðŸ˜¦

[20-Jun-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the downside risk vs upside potential seems a good risk/reward

[20-Jun-19 12:20 PM] p.#1126
ðŸ¤”

[20-Jun-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i read if you can find 3.5x the reward/risk ratio, it is a good bet

[20-Jun-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
like getting pocket aces

[20-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
what about the 10k sats @jl777c u said it would hit

[20-Jun-19 12:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess that was a joke ðŸ˜„

[20-Jun-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i think about the same chance it will hit 35k sats

[20-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
so a very good chance

[20-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
it really depends onn buttcone
