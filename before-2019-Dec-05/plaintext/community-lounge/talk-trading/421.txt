Why is KMD pumping?

[17-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Cryptofist#7504
My theory is someone really wants the weekly candle to close in a good spot, so they are market making

[17-Feb-19 03:01 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Theres def been some whale wall action for the last 2 weeks

[17-Feb-19 03:01 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I had more to say up^ there

[17-Feb-19 03:01 AM] yorklab#7270
They have been busy developing the platform the previous year, and I think between now and the end of this year we'll see the fruits of their labor.

[17-Feb-19 03:04 AM] yorklab#7270
I suspect we'll be hearing a lot from Komodo over the next 10 months.

8$.50 cents sounds more like it

[17-Feb-19 03:18 AM] Sdunbar#5064
that would be amazing lol

[17-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Likewise#6767
on longer term if it gets traction, sure why not. Look at what ETH did in 2017

[17-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Likewise#6767
not saying it will, but the possibility is there once and when a sustained bull run in crypto land starts.

[17-Feb-19 03:36 AM] KSanJuan#9608
Comparing ETH to KMD isn't even quite fair. They are such different projects with one already near its maximum potential, while KMD is just now getting out into the wild and ready to show itself and its limitless potential to the world.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I noticed you're a lot more focused on trading lately. Throw in the towel on mining business?

[17-Feb-19 03:58 AM] Likewise#6767
he better not, he'll be broke in no time lol

[17-Feb-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
I can't tell if you're playfully provoking him or actually mad at him

[17-Feb-19 03:59 AM] Likewise#6767
playfully provocing 😉

[17-Feb-19 03:59 AM] Likewise#6767
I dont get mad

[17-Feb-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
I think anything genie gets involved with he will be good at

[17-Feb-19 04:00 AM] Likewise#6767
20 years in asia teaches u that getting mad serves no purpose at all, however taking the mickey out of hin I like. Well I  am waiting for his results, I can show mine.......

[17-Feb-19 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
If he focuses on learning day trading, he'd be a pro within a few months. Dude does not do things lightly

[17-Feb-19 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
either all in or nothing it seems

[17-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Likewise#6767
day trading hey, hmm, most day traders lose their asses. Lonmger term swing trades are usually better RR

[17-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Likewise#6767
been in the trading game since 2006, live off it since then so do know my way around I suppose.

[17-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
day trade, swing trade

[17-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419

[17-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Likewise#6767

[17-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
sideways is what I want

[17-Feb-19 04:09 AM] Likewise#6767
However I jsut noticed that he is on the dev list, hmm, not a good way to insult your investors, hence why I see he is a kid still.

```what will happen after the 10 months?```
LOL, yea I guess the way I stated it, it does sounds like it ends after that.  Only meant if you follow what the team has been posting they plan on releasing some important projects between now and end of year. Next year is too far in advance to know what will be next. So course the answer is...it continues to grow.

@meatspoon If you create an atmosphere in which Genie can do no wrong and is allowed to be rude and aggressive to everyone.... and he posts constantly in all channels...  you are setting the tone for this discord

@Alexfrog why don't you offer your help so "this" have a better chance to make it. I'm i none coder. Here are 3 things that a none coder can do to help a project.
1: translation
2: paying for a cloud pc like one from digitalOcean for testing 
3: offer to help beta test new apps

2019 is not going to be a bull year. There’s a lot of recovery needed from the 2017 crash.

[17-Feb-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
next BTC halving is likely the rally point for next bull, as usual

@Likewise What team dev did you see "insulting investors"?

[17-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if genie is way out of line feel free to point him to his bulshit, but don't expect not to get backlash. I also think that a lot of the stuff he says is to provoke people like saying btc is crap

[17-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
btc is not the best crypto it can be, but nonetheless it currently is the big daddy of the entire crypto marktet from a price pov

[17-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And one could start argueing about that etc, but to what point

[17-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Better to invest your energy in other stuff

[17-Feb-19 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Everyone is entitled to his/hers/their opinion and everyone is free to debate and critisize other people's points of view

[17-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just try be be somewhat kind to one another and dont start calling names etc

[17-Feb-19 12:45 PM] yorklab#7270

While the 1st bit may be true, the 2nd isn't part of that; I truly despise BTC
