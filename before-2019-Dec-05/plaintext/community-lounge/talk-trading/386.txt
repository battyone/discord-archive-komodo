[24-Jan-19 06:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But when you are sick you will always get help and in most cases wont have to pay anything

[24-Jan-19 06:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or only a fraction of the amount

[24-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Most schools are private but just get subsidies per student

[24-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Same for uni

[24-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A year at uni costs like 1000‚Ç¨ tuition

[24-Jan-19 06:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
High end uni

[24-Jan-19 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
1000‚Ç¨ barely covers books in the US, let alone tuition (not even to a shitty "2 year college")

[24-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thats the cost to student

[24-Jan-19 07:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cost to govt is 10k+ a year prolly

2 days after the article comes out, who'da tunk it that someone would try it? :trollface:

[24-Jan-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there isnt financial gain from the attack, just a nuisance thing. still i guess people might try it

[25-Jan-19 07:36 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
@jl777c If someone can harm a currency then there is a financial gain to be made.

i was surprised nobody really cared there was no early blockchain blocks for XRP

i guess it didnt really matter as the validators were all ripple nodes and they could change any balance for any address

who comes up with such silly ideas?

[25-Jan-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
###
Any ICO projects that want to be listed on the CryptoProfile platform will be required to pay $100k for marketing. In exchange, CP tokens of the same value will be allocated to the startup and locked in an escrow account for six months or until the native tokens of the startup are listed on an exchange. The startup will then be required to allocate 10 percent of their tokens to CryptoProfile.

[25-Jan-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
$100K and 10%, but the ICO project gets due diligence for this!

[25-Jan-19 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The Knights are also well known for their insurance program with more than 2 million insurance contracts, totaling more than US$100 billion of life insurance in force.[13] This is backed by $21 billion in assets as of 2014.[13] This places it on the Fortune 1000 list. The order also owns the Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors, a money management firm that invests in accordance with Catholic social teachings.
