@markus i understand your logic but it cant be true because kmd walk from 40 to 71 on cmc...that means round about 30 coins overtake kmd althouhgt they had a smaller cap

[07-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Markus#5464
Ur thinking short timeframes

[07-Aug-19 03:04 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok sorry

[07-Aug-19 03:04 PM] coingirl87#6489
On long terms we are no longer top 100

[07-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Flint#6435
What about the big venture investors? Does anyone besides hamsters invest in Komodo?

[07-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Markus#5464
Also if kmd is rank 71 and there is over 3000 other coins, its bad?

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] coingirl87#6489
Omg

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
cmc doesn't aggregate all exchanges. kmd is lower on coinpaprika

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] coingirl87#6489
Look where we comong from

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] coingirl87#6489
When kmd come from 300 to 71 its very good

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] coingirl87#6489
But 40 to 71...?

[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] coingirl87#6489
What are you thinking?

I get it that it hurts to see ur portfolio suffer, who does not? but if market overall is suffering then i dont worry very much

[07-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Flint#6435
there are projects that a year ago were in 1000th place with a capitalization of $ 1,000,000 and now they surpass komodo! but there are those who are in the bear market immediately after listing are many times more! Take the same cosmos - why is it better than komodo?

[07-Aug-19 03:07 PM] coingirl87#6489
You dont understand my arguments

[07-Aug-19 03:07 PM] Markus#5464
40 to 71 is fine

[07-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Markus#5464
when market sentiment changes who said we cant go from 71 to 40?

[07-Aug-19 03:08 PM] coingirl87#6489
When all coins  dump its ok for me...than kmd has to stay in range of cmc 40

[07-Aug-19 03:08 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Guys please all sell so i can fill my bags @ 50 cents or something

[07-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
tbh if you look at top 50 cmc, there are several coins that just 1000x pumped on random exchanges the past months

[07-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so pretty safe to discount that shit as well

[07-Aug-19 03:09 PM] coingirl87#6489
Problem is: from 40 to is a fact and from 71 to 40 is dreaming

[07-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Markus#5464
it can happen in a week

[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Markus#5464
we can be 50 tomorrow

[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...it also can happened that kmd goes to mumber 1 in 1 day üôà

[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Flint#6435
@Buddz1993  why does this prophet not own the world ??? believe in technical analysis for cryptocurrencies?))) we have already seen many similar forecasts on komodo but each time we fall even lower! (

[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway

[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Caglio#3337
I think we should invest in me now

[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Markus#5464
Ye sure if u get a billionare to invest shitloads then sure top 5 easy

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Caglio#3337
As I told you yesterday, I am new KMD prophet

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Neko#5830
this pain is because people believe and understand the potential of thte coin otherwise they wouldnt be here

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Caglio#3337
If they dont want to buy our coin

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cosmos, V Systems, Hedgetrade, Egretia, Paxos, BTT, Energi, Lambda, EDUCare, NASH

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Neko#5830
i wouldnt

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Caglio#3337
We will make them buy our coin

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
all crap that pumped the past few months out of nowhere

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes markus...you say it...its stupid...

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Buddz1993#5380
lol indeed people are getting crazy its normal

[07-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464
Who said its not possible @coingirl87  ppl invested hundreds of millions into stocks

[07-Aug-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464
where is the difference if crypto become main stream

[07-Aug-19 03:13 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok ok...accepted you are right...from where people know about komodo?

[07-Aug-19 03:13 PM] Markus#5464
if i were rich looking to invest into something new obviously i would look for something with best possibility to grow and have outstanding tech compared to others

[07-Aug-19 03:14 PM] coingirl87#6489
At this point no demand...nothing...means for ne nobody knows komodo

[07-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Markus#5464
cause market sentiment is not focused on alt coins at this moment

[07-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Markus#5464
does not mean ppl dont know about kmd

[07-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Flint#6435
GUYS pleases one thing that on June 9 we also grew very well for no reason as we are falling now - the lower the drop, the higher the increase! but the whole difficulty is that we can fall for a long time while bitcoin dominates - we need a rollback of bitcoin or better sideways movement!

[07-Aug-19 03:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...flint you are right...the pump on 09.06 was very mysterious

[07-Aug-19 03:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd price was 0.0001

[07-Aug-19 03:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Someone knows more about that?

[07-Aug-19 03:16 PM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe an insider?

[07-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Flint#6435
@coingirl87  then on the Korean stock exchange there were a lot of purchases....

[07-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Flint#6435
I think that someone intentionally wanted us to believe in flying to the moon and then the dump started....

[07-Aug-19 03:20 PM] dan.#2473
fat finger market buy is all that was

[07-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Flint#6435
but someone is just waiting for the lower price and has already decided on the minimum price - the project has value and will not miss such an opportunity!!!

6. Financial crisis should be ending soon
7. Buy into stocks and real estate
8. R...
