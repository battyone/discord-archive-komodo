Ive been watching it for a while.  There is a lot of exploitation but really as long as you can convince the masses to go to work and be productive there should not be too much disruption.

[10-Sep-18 01:19 AM] JimD#9272
AKA the economy runs on faith and good engineering

[10-Sep-18 01:21 AM] JimD#9272
There is also the question of whether any given society is Eugenic or Dysgenic but that kind of talk hurts peoples feelings

Well, stupid people do a lot of stupid things too.  Obviously there is more to a human than raw intelligence, behavioral proclivities would be an important factor also.

[10-Sep-18 01:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I heard IQ score doesn't mean what ppl think it means

[10-Sep-18 02:14 AM] JimD#9272
it certainly will help you make the right decisions if we are talking math/science

[10-Sep-18 02:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
As a sufferer from an enormous IQ rating, I understand üòû

[10-Sep-18 02:15 AM] JimD#9272
but some people can be smart and choose to be degenerate drug addicts in spite of all the intelligence

[10-Sep-18 02:16 AM] JimD#9272
