we're refining the app, and securing the core, the migration to decentralized solution will be the next steps

ah ok! needs a bit more work - but I think this is the way to go

basically we want to allow a bridge for assetchains to make devs consider coming to KMD tech, and providing tools like what will happen with Tortuga 😉

[22-May-19 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
A ton of other features will also come, like a discord swapbot / Mobile app, and many more

[22-May-19 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
once we get everything set, as our approach is modular, we will be able to replace the current core by a DEX version, but this will take time

well doesnt have to be trading fees- but there will be some profit defo in it for you

[22-May-19 03:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, but don't forget that even if we want to tend on a DEX mode, the ability to go fast and get experience was crucial, so we wanted to design a system that can be modular enough to replace any part without problem

[22-May-19 03:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
**For Assetchain, it is set in stone, if the AC is dpowed, we won t ask for any fee for listing**, KMD is the reason am in crypto today, so I want to keep AC as a safeheaven

any coin can decide to use the templating tool

just see tortuga as Barterlly's duplicate app with different branding

[22-May-19 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
but the branding does not stop with the website, if we take Tortuga's example, when the UI will be finished, even the app will be branded Tortuga, with all designs

[22-May-19 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
the app, being the future release of mobile apps

@Deleted User I don't understand 😦

a coin that decide to get the templating done will have its own branding, but will get the benefits of the shared liquidity pool

[22-May-19 04:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
as of now, we got a defined method and a "logical path" handling offers and trades. But some options are very interesting, like the ability to skip entering your addresses via a portfolio manager : Users will have the ability to enter every address they want to receive funds on, addresses they got full control, so when a user will issue a swap, or answer to one, if he filled his Portfolio section, the app will give him the option to get a "shortcut" when filling a  trade

That's one of the thing we will develop, like profile pages for people wanting to show their rating

[22-May-19 04:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or allowing fasttrades with prefill option

[22-May-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Don't forget that on the user side, Barterlly is JUST a webpage, so it s integrable to anything, from a wallet to a mobile app, to a chrome plugin

[22-May-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
and so on ^^

[22-May-19 04:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
the core being totally independent from the app, even if the UI is down, the trading mechanism is still up ! (and for example, using the API will also work)

[22-May-19 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Deleted User I don't know if that s what you wanted to say, but are we acting like exchange, the answer is yes **and** no.
We handle funds during the trade processing, but as every trade is bound to a new and fresh generated address, there is no way to deposit funds on the platform if there is no trade involved

is csw satoshi? : D @jl777c

[22-May-19 06:41 PM] Alexfrog#1338
If he was, he wouldve demonstrated it by moving the satoshi btc.  Therefore he isnt.

[22-May-19 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
at this point, even if he did, i wouldnt believe it

[22-May-19 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it would just mean he somehow got a hold of some early block privkeys

abusedsmily 

[22-May-19 06:45 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if he did that, it would mean he was part of a group that was satoshi

[22-May-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
not necessarily. i saw an advertisement where someone was willing to pay money for any early bitcoin block privkey, even if it had no funds left in it

[22-May-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so, if a single such miner sold his privkey, then whoever bought it could sign an early bitcoin block and pretend he is satoshi

[22-May-19 06:53 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i think youre right

[22-May-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
even if he signed every single block, i still wouldnt believe he is satoshi, but that he somehow stole satoshis privkeys instead

[22-May-19 06:53 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it would mean satoshi gave it to him so they would stop looking for him

[22-May-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
no, if he just signs 3 addresses, it means 3 early miners sold it to him for $5000 each

[22-May-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
only if he signs 100,000+ worth of addresses, would it prove he has access to satoshi keys, and that just means that he obtained them in likely some illicit way
