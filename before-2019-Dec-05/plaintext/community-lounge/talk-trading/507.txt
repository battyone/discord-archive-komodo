[02-Apr-19 03:26 PM] Markus#5464
when everyone else being bullish u gotta be bearish üòâ

[02-Apr-19 03:27 PM] Markus#5464

0,00002450 btc price

[02-Apr-19 03:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Their price was set at 7M usd to raise in capital

[02-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Markus#5464
0,00002450 is 0.12$

[02-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because of the 20% pump today, they will receive less btc should they sell out compaired to yesterday?

[02-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Unpopular opinion - Btc rally was a whale getting ready for the vbk ieo :troll_thuglife:

[02-Apr-19 03:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Or it was vbk stocking up for btc fees also :troll_thuglife:

[02-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Ar least we recovered to 26 k sats level .

[02-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Markus#5464
could be that the team itself buys the coins if nobody else do

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So should they sell out they will raise 1715btc

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How long will that last them to notarize?

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A year?

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Tek#5253
@Markus you know, I read 10 bear posts

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Tek#5253
against my 1 bull post

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Tek#5253
everyone thinks its going down

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Tek#5253
not up

[02-Apr-19 03:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Will be interesting to see if bittrex out performs binance launhhpad. Eg everyone registered actually gets some tokens

[02-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464
@Tek  reason for pump is we got a inverse head and shoulders on daily chart, but its not always guaranteed, last time it was similar but we fell instead of pump

[02-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Tek#5253
> inverse head and ...

[02-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[02-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Tek#5253
reason for the pump was a pattern

[02-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[02-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was a short squeeze, nice and simple

[02-Apr-19 03:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
If history repeats we should see gradual gains for the year imo until that ultimate fomo starts.

[02-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
500M usd in short liquidations

[02-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362

gradual gains for a year sounds like we would have one epic year of alt rallies

Let's just say that BTC is ready for another run straight up. Has the scaling problem been fixed so that it is at least as fast and cheap as, e.g., a credit card? The answer is, incredibly, no!

[02-Apr-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Markus if 350 people bought the max individual cap of 200.000 vbk they sell out 70M

[02-Apr-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Customers who wish to purchase more than the maximum number of coins may purchase coins through the Bittrex OTC Trading Desk. The minimum purchase amount on the Bittrex OTC Trading Desk will be approximately US$100,000. VBK sold through the Bittrex OTC Trading Desk may be sold at a lower cost per coin than the public sale and are subject to additional terms and conditions, including trading lock-up. Information for the Bittrex OTC Trading desk, including how to request OTC trading approval, can be found here.

[02-Apr-19 04:09 PM] Markus#5464
lol

[02-Apr-19 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is this included in the 70M or excluded?

[02-Apr-19 04:09 PM] Markus#5464

[02-Apr-19 04:09 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

[02-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Alecandro#1179

[02-Apr-19 04:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They surely know what they are doing.

[02-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Considering KMD already shits all over their IEO

[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
