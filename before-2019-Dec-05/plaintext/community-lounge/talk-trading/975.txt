NANO over KMD?

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Tek#5253
both are equally a gamble

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Tek#5253
KMD attracts nerds

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Actually no

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Tek#5253
NANO attracts stacies

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
KMD is stable AF

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Tek#5253
there are more stacies than nerds

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Look at the chart

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Ethereum is full of nerds

[27-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Komodo is full of IDGAF'S

[27-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Tek#5253
ETH was the first smart contract platform so you can't compare

[27-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Tek#5253
also when I quit my last job, the stacy in HR knew about Bitcoin and Ethereum

[27-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Tek#5253
Ethereum has name and it will stay forever

[27-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Tek#5253
i also have ETH just for this reason

[27-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
You sure are a follower

[27-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Tek#5253
what do you mean follower?

[27-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
You let other people's trends decide ur port

[27-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Tek#5253
I buy before the followers

[27-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Tek#5253
and sell to them

[27-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Tek#5253
i do real life market research

[27-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Tek#5253
stacy hasn't bought ethereum

[27-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Tek#5253
but when she decides to finally, in 3 or 4 years buy a crypto

[27-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Tek#5253
she'll buy ethereum

[27-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
You buy from the leaders & lead the followers

[27-Jul-19 09:33 AM] Tek#5253
yeah. I can't compete with the nerds okay. being before the group of nerds is much more difficult and most projects don't actually make it

[27-Jul-19 09:33 AM] Tek#5253
much more risk

[27-Jul-19 09:33 AM] Tek#5253
so i don't buy kmd ecosystem coins

[27-Jul-19 09:33 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Lol it's like me saying I don't buy ERC-20

[27-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Tek#5253
m currently holding a portfolio of  pretty much safe bets

[27-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
@Tek it's all good bro. I'm just messing w/you

[27-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
I'm glad you're here

[27-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Being genuine too

[27-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Tek#5253
I almost got financially destroyed with gambling on early projects

[27-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Tek#5253
I made it out with huge profit

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
but if I didn't sell I would have been destroyed

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
so yeah

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
i dno't want to go through that anymore

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
It sounds like you made some bad decisions to begin

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
Yes I bought some absolute crap when I started out

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
in mid 2017

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Everyone has done it

[27-Jul-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
didn't even watch a chart before i bought my first shit coin

[27-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
which was OMG

[27-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
(you can imagine)

[27-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
And u think KMD ecosystem coins are shit lol

[27-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
OmiseGo lol

[27-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253

[27-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
They still have no mainnet

[27-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
Im glad I sold 2 months after for the 2x btc run

[27-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
I'm not trying to hear all of that lol

[27-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
I just want to be cautious that I dont' get fucked over again

[27-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
therh's many projects with great promisis

[27-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Set a fucking SL

[27-Jul-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
90% will not deliver

[27-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
It's simple

[27-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Tek#5253
setting a stop loss means I'm speculating

[27-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
You buy.
You then set an amount, that if triggered, will automatically sell.

[27-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
No it means you are being safe

[27-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
It's a market

[27-Jul-19 09:38 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Shit happens in all markets

[27-Jul-19 09:39 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
This is called securing your investment

[27-Jul-19 09:39 AM] Tek#5253
i've found the good projects now

[27-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Even good projects have tough times

[27-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
true but if I just buy and hold to sell in ~2 years

[27-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
I'll be fine

[27-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Not my money, I could care less lol

[27-Jul-19 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
and if I actually have all the good projects I don't need to sell

[27-Jul-19 09:41 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Good doesn't always equal value

[27-Jul-19 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
i disagree

[27-Jul-19 10:13 AM] Markus#5464
holding is such a huge loss of gains

[27-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Markus#5464
if kmd goes up 50% in 1 day it wont stay like that we all know that so why not take advantage of that and increasse ur stack

[27-Jul-19 10:15 AM] Markus#5464
its same like btc... it went up idk 300%, if u sold in sort of right moments which all were quite obvious then u might have instead done 450%

if you trade/speculatyou pay a 33% to 50% tax around here

[27-Jul-19 10:25 AM] Tek#5253
if you do not speculate you pay 0 tax

[27-Jul-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
or u dont pay taxes and let nobody know

[27-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Tek#5253

[27-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Markus#5464

https://t.co/NqHOlld58s  why America is still great and probably doesn't need to be made great again? Because despite being a monstrous empire its government and regulators are still flexible, and support innovation.

kmd sort of decoupling from btc? btc dumps 4% while kmd stays the same

[27-Jul-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
thats something new

[27-Jul-19 02:29 PM] richardt#2807
That's because everything has become a stablecoin while BTC dances around

[27-Jul-19 02:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
Btc has got the rhythm of a drunk white girl.
