[16-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So the question is whether or not it will be different this time and alt prices will decouple from btc valuation

[16-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And we won't see another year of BTC doing nothing and alts bleeding as well

[16-Aug-18 08:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Especially when alts have the tech going for them

[16-Aug-18 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
um... i think you are getting cause and effect reversed

[16-Aug-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC has been the vast majority (or simple majority) of overall marketcap, so as BTC goes, the overall marketcap must follow, with just small exeptions

[16-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yes, that's why I said that it would be interesting to see the variations, meaning the total mcap without btc

[16-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but not sure if you can pull that from cmc

[16-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
let me check, I thought that was possible

[16-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[16-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Still kind of correlated

[16-Aug-18 08:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If I compare the last 2014 - 2018 years, I think in that bull and bear runs, I should have sold my alts for BTC while those were still up, even in the middle of bull or bear run.

[16-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
only that btc precedes altcoin prices

[16-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
With the knowledge I have now I could probably have had 10-1000x more to what I have now

[16-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But hindsight is a cruel mistress :p

[16-Aug-18 08:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I still don't have the knowledge.... üòÑ

[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
haha I meant more in the sense of btc peaks dec 23rd

[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
even after years, I feel I haven't learned much...some but not enough....

[16-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Can you ever learn enough

[16-Aug-18 08:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if I can feel like, that I'm Okay this bear run or bull run, that will make me feel, yes, that's okay kinda learnt... üòÑ

[16-Aug-18 08:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

trading wizards.... what is the possibility of KMD's price going to almost half of what it is now? in btc terms ?

[16-Aug-18 09:34 AM] WhiteWidow#8771
37.46% :trollface:

[16-Aug-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't been to local bitcoin meetup in months. I usually got such conversations and help from those meetups. miss them now.

[16-Aug-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To me it seem at the floor, if we dump further in btc from here IMO we are in big trouble.

[16-Aug-18 10:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It always happens, if my experience from NXT days applies here.... ü§î

[16-Aug-18 10:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but then again have to wait for alt bull season....

[16-Aug-18 10:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in that case the value goes beyond expectations.....

[16-Aug-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
since we are in long bear market, my trouble is keeping my monthly expenses fine and portfolio in shape....

[16-Aug-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I found it hardest to do since I entered this space....

[16-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I always focus on self improvement during these times
