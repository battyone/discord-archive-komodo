‚ö† Warned `mrtzmp3#2896`

[28-Sep-19 07:22 AM] Audo#5667
mrtzmp3 was banned as he also had a long history of childish behaviour combined with the disrespect he showed today.

Anyone who misbehaves with a history of excessive foul language and childish behaviour will get banned without warning.

Any data scientist or ML expert here? need some guidance on trading strategy to be used on a model. Please let me know

[28-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Caglio#3337
@Audo he was a well respected member of community, I dont really know what he wrote, but I cannot believe he got ban after one warn...

[28-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Neko#5830
he was a bit on the angry side but yeah

[28-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Caglio#3337
I really think you should get him back here

[28-Sep-19 01:53 PM] crumb#2550
it seems that banhammer comes down too easily. it's a fine line to determine what is abuse, but if bans come too easily, it does not encourage the healty discussions we need to have. 

we need to see as many sides as possible on all issues. even if we don't necessarily agree with them.

The issue is not that ppl discuss, that would be completely fine. The issue is disrespecting other ppl in the community and childish behaviour like @Audo previously stated. Talking in such way just bring negativity to others and make the atmosphere in the channel pretty bad.

[28-Sep-19 02:00 PM] joe2x4#5987
True, discord is not a personal punching bag

[28-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
A good example is the talking about bad marketing when KMD was dropping in price for quite sometime.

[28-Sep-19 02:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
there should be generous warning given, but I have to admit that I don't care much to be lectured about the 1001 different names of feces, and I think that really reduces quality of a discussion

[28-Sep-19 02:05 PM] joe2x4#5987
Would you talk to your mother like that rule. Kmd discord is growing up to business casual.

I searched his message history and it was full of this type of stuff

[28-Sep-19 02:52 PM] crumb#2550
ok, if there is history of abuse, personal attacks and namecalling then there are justifications.

[28-Sep-19 02:52 PM] crumb#2550
justifications for banning that is

[28-Sep-19 02:53 PM] crumb#2550
but there are some people who only express themselves with foul language

[28-Sep-19 02:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
that's like half of the people in here

[28-Sep-19 02:55 PM] yorklab#7270
I don't know what he said, but I'm glad there's finally some rules to follow. I got sick and tired of people talking about there sexual fantasies or personal attacks. You have to draw the line somewhere and there are plenty of other channels/places to talk about that stuff. This and other channels have topics and we should at least try to stay on that topic.

i have politely pointed out to some people, totally publicly and not in DM-s, that sometimes it is ok express strong emotions, but if it repeated curses every 20min then it's not ok. 

that persons reply to me was: go f*** yourself

so i just stopped replying to him and engaging in any way. hope to see that now it's being handled in some way

[28-Sep-19 03:14 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Shall we move this into #talk-other-topics and keep this channel for trading related discussions?

[28-Sep-19 03:14 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
KMD holding this 7k sat range pretty well

[28-Sep-19 03:16 PM] Audo#5667
good note @Bernz - Selling LABS , also #discord-feedback is a good place to leave feedback about the discord moderation policy

[28-Sep-19 03:17 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
LABS had a huge volume spike on graviex, someone bought ~25k :labs: considering circ supply is under 2m

At least there's no chance $BTC will follow NOKIA's path and complete the full hyperwave, returning to its "phase 1". No chance. Nokia's second peak hit $42, then eventually came down to $1.63. Human psychology is much more rational in the cryptosphere. Nothing to worry ab...

i find the constant quest to find a comparative narratives quite amusing. but pay no attention to me and carry on ...

[28-Sep-19 04:30 PM] richardt#2807
It's just human nature to compare things and look for patterns

[28-Sep-19 04:31 PM] crumb#2550
even if most of the time, they aren't there

[28-Sep-19 04:31 PM] crumb#2550
correlation /= causation

[28-Sep-19 04:31 PM] richardt#2807
I agree.  Just people trying to make sense out of things they don't understand

[28-Sep-19 04:33 PM] crumb#2550
signal to noise ratio is so out of balance that quite often it's hard to find any signals at all. it's all drowned out by the massive barrage of noise

[28-Sep-19 04:38 PM] richardt#2807
trading patterns and historical data aside, one thing that's always for certain is supply and demand.  In my view, this dip is just another bear trap.  Next halving is just 8 months away

[28-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Caglio#3337
@Audo messages you post about bitcoin dropping are not a lie at all

[28-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Caglio#3337
As I think @Markus said bitcoin dropping is manipulated

[28-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Caglio#3337
And he commented as "no shit Sherlock"

[28-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Caglio#3337
what is wrong in that ?

[28-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Its normal that people are nervous about constant money loss on crypto

[28-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Caglio#3337
He really didnt do anything wrong, and I say that, as a guy that fought mrzmpt3 a lot

[28-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Caglio#3337
He always defended komodo, even in the darkest days

[28-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Caglio#3337
So I find that ban totally unreal and undesreved

[28-Sep-19 04:52 PM] Caglio#3337
I understand people have problems with me saying stuff, but it is who I am, and I assure you, I would talk like that even to peoples faces... He didnt deserve ban, not for that if nothing

[28-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337
As far as I recall futures dropped bitcoin and all coins price twice already... Obviously looks manipulated, we can pretend its not like that, but it is

[28-Sep-19 04:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, this is trading topic, I dont want to spam, but I think ban like this was completely undeserved

@Caglio I have been watching and frequenting the trading channel in Komodo discord for the last couple of years and in recent months the content and talk has been offensive, to a point where I have avoided it, as probably others have too.

Beligerence, foul language and constant references to drugs and prostituion and many other topics are not befitting of a project like Komodo.

[28-Sep-19 06:56 PM] Caglio#3337
@digital bullion but ƒërztmp3 didnt do any of that?

[28-Sep-19 06:56 PM] Caglio#3337
mrztmp3

[28-Sep-19 06:56 PM] digital bullion#8223
Yes he has on numerous occasions been beligerent.

[28-Sep-19 06:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Well are we talking about past now ? or the new rulings of kmd discord ?

[28-Sep-19 06:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Because I dont remember him doing anything after Audo explained new rules

[28-Sep-19 06:57 PM] digital bullion#8223
As  @Audo stated it was to do with previous conversations, not just the recent one.

[28-Sep-19 06:57 PM] Caglio#3337
I still think its too harsh, he got warning, and that warning went to insta ban

[28-Sep-19 06:58 PM] Caglio#3337
What is the point of warning if it insta bans you ?

[28-Sep-19 06:59 PM] digital bullion#8223
Well it sets a new precedent, maybe people will think twice about being vile, beligerent and using foul language.

[28-Sep-19 07:00 PM] grumpygoron#4320
As much as I love reading this stuff, if we‚Äôre talking about following guidelines I doubt talking about someone being banned belongs in this channel

[28-Sep-19 07:00 PM] digital bullion#8223
Sure.

[28-Sep-19 07:00 PM] Caglio#3337
@grumpygoron true, lets take it to talk off topic, or whatever its the name of it

$DOGE the leading indicator for every major alt season.

Been in accumulation for 100 days at around 20-25 level and probably soon to see another cycle to the upside. 

Constant cycle in this range for over 2000 days....

I joined chat channels for SuperNET in 2015. my first intro to such kind of communication medium after early days of chats like IRC and Yahoo Chat etc.
Learned a great deal of things about cryptocurrency and trading.
Plethora of knowledge spewed by people in #trading channel was the most priceless thing I have ever learned and practice in real life.
Please keep trading channel absolutely concentrated with trading and wealth creation talks.

$KMD One of my favorite setups at the moment. Still in pre-breakout, so it could spend a bit more time inside the range first.
