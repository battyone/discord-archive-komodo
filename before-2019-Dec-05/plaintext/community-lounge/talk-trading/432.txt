Greetings @Caglio - Have you met @Hollowman9000 ?  He's our resident purchaser of noods.   Usually about 100KMD for a set.

[21-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Caglio#3337
Wait what, 100KMD is like a big money here

[21-Feb-19 12:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Then your noods better be spicy

For 100KMD I will wear a wig, and call myself Nancy, the german barely legal teen

[21-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Caglio#3337
@FishyGuts so how are you sir, I seen you have been a little bit more active @ twitter lately

[21-Feb-19 12:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'm very active usually on PirateChain tho.

[21-Feb-19 12:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Im great, yourself?

[21-Feb-19 12:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Not bad, I am glad to see you active here and there , ur cool fella

[21-Feb-19 12:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Plus Im gonna give you a % of kmd when @Hollowman9000 decide on type of nudes he wants to buy

[21-Feb-19 12:39 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He already pays me 10% of the price as his agent.  

Thanks for the nod.  The gospel of the dPoW is strong.

[21-Feb-19 12:40 AM] Caglio#3337
Haha, hollowmans avatar is almost scary as mine, he probably takes KMD from other users by bullying them üò¶

[21-Feb-19 12:46 AM] Zoroaster#5093
Any ideas when the KMD rebrand is going to happen? Do you think they'll announce it beforehand or will we just have it happen one eventful afternoon?

[21-Feb-19 12:48 AM] Caglio#3337
They will anounce it for sure

[21-Feb-19 12:48 AM] Caglio#3337
Announce *

[21-Feb-19 12:49 AM] Caglio#3337
And I remember rebrand was schelduled for the end of 2018 tho

[21-Feb-19 12:50 AM] Markus#5464
ye something like that

[21-Feb-19 12:53 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Rebrand is a continuing process. It is still continuing at this point. As you can notice, there is more awareness about KMD nowadays than in the past.                                               
TL:DR Rebranding is a continuing process

[21-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Does port need to be specified in a conf file for addnode?

[21-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Addnode=1.2.3.4 or addnode=1.2.3.4:5678

[21-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or will the daemon attempt connection on the standard port of the coin if not specified?

[21-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And I‚Äôm out of the noods markets

[21-Feb-19 01:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sorry

[21-Feb-19 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... Should use port of the assetchain

[21-Feb-19 02:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thx

[21-Feb-19 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like I mean you dont need to specify it

[21-Feb-19 02:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[21-Feb-19 12:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think the rise is having to do with other crypto communities indirectly giving relevance to technology that KMD already has.

[21-Feb-19 12:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Someone said something about making LN more secure using notarizations.

[21-Feb-19 12:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Then Dan Larimer is saying that the future is multichain networks.

[21-Feb-19 12:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So here we are, with years of experience in these two camps, but just now big personalities in crypto are noticing this is actually the way to go.

[21-Feb-19 12:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Although, these people are completely ignoring or giving no credit at all to KMD.

[21-Feb-19 12:34 PM] dokrates#8987
what happens

[21-Feb-19 12:34 PM] dokrates#8987
why such dump

[21-Feb-19 12:39 PM] Likewise#6767
hmm, that is obviously not good for the uptrend if we go below 2310, we need to bounce and continue the uptrend. If not, mor delay I suppose to reach higher prices.

[21-Feb-19 12:41 PM] dokrates#8987
i think some traders expecting btc dumping, and they selling profits

[21-Feb-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_would be OK with a bounce off 2190_

[21-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Likewise#6767
yeah I had 2166 as  ultimate

[21-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Likewise#6767
but that would delay us again

[21-Feb-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
weekly wont break resistances so easily

volume still around 410 BTC on binance, high compaired to what it used to be.

Hey guys need your opinion, we will put a vote on twitter a pull request
few people contributed to put this together thank you

[21-Feb-19 01:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
regarding the issue we have had with the founders CC causing a small inflation of supply,
we have reached out to JL777 who is fixing this issue as we speak. We have had multiple opinions on what to do with the funds, 
from keeping them in our reserve for future developments, to a complete coin burn of all additional coins.
There are currently ""31,742,881"" coins which have been minted from the founders CC out of a total circulating supply of around 130,000,000.

We would like to reach out to the community and find a solution that works with everyone, while furthering
the vision of √ò CryptoUnion. One of the ideas and feedback we have received is that we should make use of the
 funds in a fair way that  benefits everyone (Early investors, Komodo holders, OCU, New investors and Development)


We have taken into consideration the % of inflation, the current low price of OUR, the fundraiser investors, and the effects
that these extra tokens will have on the price action. We would like some more feedback on whether this would be an appropriate solution and would 
like to hear back from you, whether here or in private DM.

[21-Feb-19 01:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
‚Äî 45% airdrop to current OUR holders, to offset any losses if we were to not burn the coins, allowing the early investors to stake and grow their OUR;

‚Äî 15% airdrop to Komodo holders, to gain more interest in the project, to spread the supply out more evenly ensuring fair distribution without having 1 or 2 people holding most of the supply, 
as well as a thank you for the platform which has made this whole project possible for us;

‚Äî 5% reserved for twitter contests and discord drops, to thank you all for being in this community and to have small giveaways and contests;

‚Äî 25% Auctioned off in 30 lots of 250,000 OUR for BTC, the BTC of which will be held in a publically viewable address, with the BTC funds dedicated solely for the purpose of
coin listings and advertisement in the future. This would be a better solution than the current model of asking for donations to list on bigger exchanges, as well as giving everyone a chance to get
some more OUR at cheaper rates. This allows us to receive BTC without having to sell our native token, or causing downward price pressure while solving the issue of raising BTC for exchange listings;

‚Äî 10% Founders to use for further development of the platform.

This small early inflation would also lower the entry point into our OCU investment and loaning platform, allowing more people to get a higher membership tier for the same amount of OUR held.

[21-Feb-19 01:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
With the very low liquidity, we dont think this additional supply would have much of an impact on price, taking into account our marketcap is below 1,000,000 atm and very low trading activity
it is more of an interest/publicity problem, and the airdrop will definitely help with that
I think that, along with burning any additional funds on top of whatever is currently in that address, would be a good solution


We think that auctioning off "additional" supply minted for BTC for purpose of furthering listings only and allowing more investors in really makes it work out to be a very good thing if it goes ahead

`25% Auctioned off in 30 lots of 250,000 OUR for BTC`

[21-Feb-19 01:56 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
As long as theres no "minimum" or "set price" i think a few private auction would be pretty good, better than them dumping these coins for btc or beg cucking to get listed on shittopia or something

[21-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Fab√ò#8941
I share this view &  open to suggestions

[21-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
the ones participating in the fundraiser atm are more donating to help the project than buying tokens from what I see, price:token wise when its much cheaper on digitalprice

[21-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
oh theyll be back

[21-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

@Fab√ò as long as transparency is top priority, I think it should work out

thanks @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[21-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
ive got a decently stack, and this is better than burning the coins imo. Yeah I/we might get a bit less stake once more people join, but this outcome gives free coins to komodo, helps further the fuckton of shit you guys are planning on doing

given the space within a space that your product(s) are in, transparency would be the only real stumbling block to moving forward as long
as you maintain that and ethics, people will be generally OK with how things get dispersed
