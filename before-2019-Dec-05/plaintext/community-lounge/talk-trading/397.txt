@Crabby Paddy so true about doing what others want to. I think I spend half my time in interviews and in conversations trying to play down our offerings a bit.  Almost all problems that come up, we reply with, 'we can already do that'. Now comes the time for us to show it. Its getting exciting now

[03-Feb-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha ... Trying to start a chain in #kmdlabs  right now that pays ntoaries per ntoarisation as part of the coin emissiion... this changes a lot if it works. 😄

@Crabby Paddy  this is what you need to use for staking with PoS64

[04-Feb-19 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it requires a speical daemon currenlty probably doesnt work with Agama.. you should be able to split with agama though... jsut not run the staking script itself.

lol most of them are definitely not here. they have their offices and frontmen doing their dirty work.

[04-Feb-19 02:41 PM] PTYX#6840
Coinapult for example "operates from Panama" but there are no offices to be found. I remember Ira Miller being the one running it some time back but he cut ties with them.

[04-Feb-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
did anyone see a corpse of the dead guy?

[04-Feb-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Someone already alleged here that he might just have taken off with it

he dies mysteriously at the age of 30, on a trip in India....

[04-Feb-19 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
nothing shady 'bout that

[04-Feb-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Faked his own death

[04-Feb-19 03:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
lol right

[04-Feb-19 03:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
must be

[04-Feb-19 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, btw, he had the only keys to $150M USD in cryptocoins, totally unrelated

[04-Feb-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just wonder, did he even tell his wife, or is he lying to her too?

[04-Feb-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty risky for her, she probably doesn't understand transparent address blockchain analysis

[04-Feb-19 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*If* he is dead, I can't discount the wife's claim on just face value
If/when I die, there's 100% chance that my wife would have to enlist help to access my wallets

[04-Feb-19 03:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
my gf doesnt understand anything about crypto

[04-Feb-19 03:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But she knows where to look and who to contact if shit hits the fan

[04-Feb-19 03:04 PM] PTYX#6840
maybe death certificates are just cheaper in india
