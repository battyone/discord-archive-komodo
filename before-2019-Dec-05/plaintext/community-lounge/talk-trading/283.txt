[17-Nov-18 03:17 PM] snowdamn#2414
wait, are we talking about SEC going after Komodo?
i don't believe the recent SEC news apply
sorry, was talking about the projects that they can go after in US jurisdiction
most they can do is get us delisted from US CEXs and forbid US citizens from having accounts abroad

@hernzzzzzz Bitcoin Cash ABC miners are also making considerable daily losses, even larger losses than SV miners, according to our estimates.

[17-Nov-18 03:53 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
not sure about SV - if they actually should mine two chains right (their own + ABC to kill)? so their losses bigger ?

[17-Nov-18 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if SV is actually trying to attack, then yes, they need to 51% the ABC while continuing with the SV mining

[17-Nov-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
we are talking exahashes being added to ABC and SV. didnt look up the nicehash cost for SHA256, but bitmex cant be too far off the mark

[17-Nov-18 03:56 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
how long this money burning can last you think?

[17-Nov-18 03:56 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
assuming some guys on both sides are at least a bit reasonable ?

[17-Nov-18 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if they were a bit reasonable, it would never have started

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as the exchanges select one or the other fork to be the BCH, it seems pointless as there are two chains

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
its not like having more hashpower will make the other chain go away

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
yes but we can count the initial phase of demonstration of self confidence

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
the claim is that they're burning BTC, which to them is useless

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but some resume should come from their brains now

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if they need hashrate and the BTC gets them hashrate, it seems not so useless

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
so useless that they kept every single dime after BCH split :trollface:

[17-Nov-18 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`miners are also making considerable daily losses` this was announced as an intention, why is anyone surprised?

[17-Nov-18 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the fekwits at the "top" have have said that they are going into loss to force other side to loss, why anyone bothers to think they aren't going to be at the bottom and at a loss is feken beyond me

[17-Nov-18 04:02 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
BSV is not on CMC

[17-Nov-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If 2 of us said that we were going to each put 100M sols on KMD even if it cost us daily losses, would it surprise anyone that it would be a loss for "regular" miners to mine KMD?

[17-Nov-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[17-Nov-18 04:03 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if they wont negotiate in a week situation shuoldf be clear (in terms ob branding), except taht ABC will be in danger untill the get dPOW ?

[17-Nov-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if ABC keeps adding checkpoints, they are in no danger from being overwritten

[17-Nov-18 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
adding dPoW to any side would invalidate the notion of consensus, imo

do you really want replay prots added to a contentious fork? Isn't that akin to saying "OK, we concede that we may lose"?

[17-Nov-18 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I mean that adding prots proactively adds the ability for some random exchange to make the decision based on econ and avoid consensus

[17-Nov-18 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
imo, if you set aside the millionaires at the top swinging their diks at each other, this is how consensus is **supposed to** work

[17-Nov-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but they are on different forks

[17-Nov-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a single chain they are fighting over

[17-Nov-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont seem many people pointing this basic fact out

[17-Nov-18 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
but that's the point, whatever chain ends up being the "winner" should be the decider of what the "real protocol" is when the users of the "other side(s)" finally concede; actual decentralization

[17-Nov-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but both chains will live on as it has forked and both forks are being mined

[17-Nov-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
at some point, the average Tom, Dick, and Harry will all run out of funds and pick a "winner"

[17-Nov-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yet, both chains will still exist

[17-Nov-18 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
It is like BCH vs BTC (ignoring the replay protection part). nothing will make either chain disappear

[17-Nov-18 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
true, there's no "easy" answer with out some modicum of centralization

[17-Nov-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an arbitrary decision which fork is declared to be the real BCH

[17-Nov-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
more based on public opinion than anything else

[17-Nov-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow they setup the contest to be which chain has more hashpower

[17-Nov-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`more based on public opinion than anything else` <- but isn't that how a decentralized protocol is meant to be?

[17-Nov-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess that the only purely objective metric that exists, so probably better than other means, but it is still arbitrary

[17-Nov-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
"generally accepted"

[17-Nov-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
well, the central exchanges will be determining the winner of this

[17-Nov-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so having centralized exchanges centrally deciding things doesnt seem very decentralized
