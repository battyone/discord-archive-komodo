Z- cancelation?

[28-Jul-19 04:00 AM] bishop#9773
Removing zaddrs from KMD

[28-Jul-19 04:18 AM] Hermes#6934
Market action is now based in popularity contests....based on that ,Libra is lifting more eyebrows than most of the Altcoins.

[28-Jul-19 04:30 AM] Caglio#3337
lets go holloway

[28-Jul-19 04:31 AM] peritonlogon#7708
Hold on,. Is this something small, or is KMD no longer going to be a z coin?

[28-Jul-19 04:33 AM] bishop#9773
Zaddrs are no longer part of KMD, the coin. They exist as asset chains on the Komodo Platform however (like ARRR)

[28-Jul-19 04:34 AM] bishop#9773
There is supposed to be a pegged coin that allows KMD to move to it for privacy but I have no idea if that's still an idea with pirate

[28-Jul-19 04:35 AM] Caglio#3337
I love how some people dont even know kmd stopped being privacy coin

[28-Jul-19 04:35 AM] Caglio#3337
Just tells about how good work our marketing is doing

[28-Jul-19 04:36 AM] Caglio#3337
noone knows shit about kmd

[28-Jul-19 04:36 AM] Caglio#3337
not even kmd holders

[28-Jul-19 04:37 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Assetchains even less known, I envision an ARRR/KMD flippening at some point, especially if KMD doesn't kick into gear soon, ARRR fundamentals are too stronk

[28-Jul-19 04:37 AM] Caglio#3337
^ tru

[28-Jul-19 04:39 AM] peritonlogon#7708
I'm not in this discord all the time, but seriously, why the fuck would we get rid of privacy?  I feel betrayed.

[28-Jul-19 04:40 AM] bishop#9773
It was announced back in November iirc with the fork date in Feb.

[28-Jul-19 04:40 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
KMD existance and presence allows the true privacy coin to flourish, with the added security of the KMD platform and bitcoin itself

[28-Jul-19 04:40 AM] bishop#9773
James foreseen issues with KMD being a privacy-oriented coin, especially with regulators

[28-Jul-19 04:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
1) low anon set 2) security liability 3) closed off certain large markets

[28-Jul-19 04:42 AM] bishop#9773
Sounds like someone needs to head over to digitalprice.io and exchange some of their KMD to ARRR at less than 1/10th the price of KMD

[28-Jul-19 04:42 AM] peritonlogon#7708
Bernz, how do?

[28-Jul-19 04:42 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I literally have 0 kmd

[28-Jul-19 04:42 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
at the moment

[28-Jul-19 04:42 AM] peritonlogon#7708
How so?

[28-Jul-19 04:42 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
assetchains

[28-Jul-19 04:43 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
of which I can then in the future trade for more KMD/ARRR depending on the current state of the market

[28-Jul-19 04:44 AM] bishop#9773
@peritonlogon You don't still have some of your KMD shielded by chance, do you?

[28-Jul-19 04:44 AM] peritonlogon#7708
No

[28-Jul-19 04:44 AM] bishop#9773
good

[28-Jul-19 04:45 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
If you're asking how KMD allows ARRR to flourish, its because they were basically given a jumpstart compared to a developer, say on Ethereum attempting to do the same thing, KMD being a Z-cash fork allows ARRR to have zk-snarks and the benefit of dPow

[28-Jul-19 04:45 AM] bishop#9773
There's about 85k locked

[28-Jul-19 04:46 AM] peritonlogon#7708
I think I need to just get out of Altcoins.  They require too much time and effort just to stay up to speed with the basics, let alone be ahead of the curve.

But too late now

[28-Jul-19 04:48 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I mean, we may be biased, but you've made it to the right place in my honest opinion

[28-Jul-19 04:50 AM] peritonlogon#7708
I mean I read a decent amount in a daily basis, and I follow a half dozen discords, but not often enough apparently, and I miss a pretty big change in a community I've been taking part in since NXT.

[28-Jul-19 04:51 AM] bishop#9773
End of last year, early part of this year, it was discussed quite frequently. Not sure what your schedule was then but it was regularly posted

[28-Jul-19 04:51 AM] bishop#9773
The most important thing to remember is that privacy still exists on the platform
