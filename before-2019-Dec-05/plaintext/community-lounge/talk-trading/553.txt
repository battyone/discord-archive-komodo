cost of living goes up and you just live in a concentrated space where your high salary only means something as soon as you step out

the number of perpetually "poor" people that live in the US and actively plan and strive for their own future: 0

[16-Apr-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then that's the __active choice__ they make
a "crisis" that does not make

`All those baby boomers sitting on land with taxes of the late 70s.`
and that impacts someone from getting a job and moving how?

[16-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
problem is that often you get taxed on property that was already bought with taxed money

@Deleted User I posted the link to a thread in telegram and I got banned for 'asking for votes"

property tax is a yearly thing in the US

[16-Apr-19 03:39 PM] jansako#3330
similar to 'council tax' in the UK

[16-Apr-19 03:40 PM] Malti#3948
heritage tax, same thing

[16-Apr-19 03:40 PM] jansako#3330
it's how cities raise money to pay for services

[16-Apr-19 03:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so is in belgium and most of europe @jansako

[16-Apr-19 03:40 PM] Malti#3948
money was taxed by earner and is taxed again by (passive) recipient

[16-Apr-19 03:40 PM] jansako#3330
so it has nothing to do with how you bought the property as

@jansako no property tax in belgium is something different from regular city tax here... City tax is for services rendered by the city like waste disposal, roads etc

[16-Apr-19 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
property tax is a federal tax that goes into the bottomless pit that is the government over here

Woah a new tidbit of info on CG

Federal/income tax no thanks

[16-Apr-19 03:42 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Other places have fewer bridges? I'm not sure why they don't move out of state to find better living. Just wanted to point out not easy to buy land and build affordable living areas when each purchase has the tax hike to make up for the people paying very little for decades.
