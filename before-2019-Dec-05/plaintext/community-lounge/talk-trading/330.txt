during the entire year

[05-Dec-18 09:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah.

[05-Dec-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
including being able to buy more EOS with the funds from sales

[05-Dec-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so how much did they actually raise?

[05-Dec-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the fact they cant answer this question is a big red flag

[05-Dec-18 09:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is the tricky question heheh

[05-Dec-18 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
ETH or BTC address, how hard can that be?

[05-Dec-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, they could have just sold a couple billion of EOS after it started trading, so actually end up with more than $4 billion

[05-Dec-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
quite the trick

[05-Dec-18 09:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There was a site that listed ico holding

[05-Dec-18 09:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont find it yet

[05-Dec-18 09:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
zcash gets listed on coinbase and subsequently drops 10%... that can't feel good.

Yea getting listed on Coinbase doesn’t mean much in this market lol

[05-Dec-18 09:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Interesting. Eos shows no data

[05-Dec-18 09:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It says they raised 640k eth or something like that but no follow up and no information of what haa been done with the coins recently

[05-Dec-18 09:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
seems like the sec would have dropped a nuke on eos by now.

[05-Dec-18 09:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They are not in the US

[05-Dec-18 09:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like its not an easy task

[05-Dec-18 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the whole world is in the US, how do you not know this?

[05-Dec-18 09:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I know. But one thing is that, the other is working and having proof a specific crime was commited to jsutify extradition

EOS ICO review, all information about token sale EOS (EOS) | ICORating
EOS is software that introduces a blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved through an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built. It is developed by the Block.One team.

[05-Dec-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody from USSA bought EOS in ICO?

[05-Dec-18 09:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you notice, the only ICOs being indicted by the sec are US established

[05-Dec-18 09:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, but its not easy to prove there has actually been fraud or any crime commited.

[05-Dec-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
EOS feels like the most expensive DB ever

😂 

[05-Dec-18 09:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[05-Dec-18 09:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Still no mention of holding address anywhere

[05-Dec-18 09:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What still blows my mind about eos is that you have to actually buy an account

[05-Dec-18 09:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its like if you had to buy a btc address

[05-Dec-18 09:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
WITH PAYPAL

[05-Dec-18 09:43 PM] tolken#2655
Kmd got a “high” hype rating on that site. Hah

[05-Dec-18 09:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

buying virtual  RAM + staking for CPU usage aswell ...

[05-Dec-18 09:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But why do you have to buy the account

[05-Dec-18 09:45 PM] tolken#2655
Don’t you effectively have to “buy” an eth addr with gas when you create a new wallet? Or do you mean you actually need to buy eos addr with PayPal?? 😉

[05-Dec-18 09:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I could understand the ram and cpu stuff... not like it, but its they revenue model.

[05-Dec-18 09:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The thing is that you need someone to hand you the address/account

[05-Dec-18 09:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its technically free... but if you want the free one you have to wait something like a month to have access to it or somethjng like that

[05-Dec-18 09:46 PM] tolken#2655
Maybe they mail it to you on paper certificate.

[05-Dec-18 09:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So a market exists for accounts like domain names

[05-Dec-18 09:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What i dont understand is why would you need to pay or wait for an account to be used if there is no funds in it.

[05-Dec-18 09:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You then have to go and buy eos to put in that address... doesnt that break the whole purpose?

That's not how coinbase listing pumps should work right? $ZEC

Like when a new restaurant opens 😂

[06-Dec-18 12:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Just bought 2 ZEC just for the novelty of buying them directly with usd

[06-Dec-18 12:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think i might actually use zec as gateway coin now

[06-Dec-18 12:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
traitor 😡

[06-Dec-18 12:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why! What?

[06-Dec-18 12:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You're supposed to gateway COQUI, not ZEC :trollface:

[06-Dec-18 12:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The day coqui gets added to CB ill do it

[06-Dec-18 12:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:trollface:

[06-Dec-18 12:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
Enjoy waiting a week for coinbase to let you send “your” coin

[06-Dec-18 12:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
Maybe thats just btc though.

I can trade it in cb until dec 11 😅

🤑 🤑 🤑

[06-Dec-18 12:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont know why im very happy that zcash is in cb

[06-Dec-18 12:54 AM] Llama#1330
omg zec is in cb??

[06-Dec-18 12:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I guess it is because it opens that slight possibility that in the future kmd could get there

🙏🏽 

[06-Dec-18 12:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[06-Dec-18 12:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
Coinbase scares me a little. I try to do as little business w/them as possible but it’s a necessary evil at this point.

[06-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Torankoku#4818
lol they list zcash

[06-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Torankoku#4818
before xrp

[06-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Torankoku#4818
tell me that is not market manipulation

[06-Dec-18 01:01 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why would it or why would it matter?

[06-Dec-18 01:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
waiting for them to release my coin is a recent development. Used to be way faster.

[06-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Torankoku#4818
they should list all coins compatiable with erc20 first since they eth chain up

[06-Dec-18 01:02 AM] Torankoku#4818
but who am i to argue. i dont use coinbase xD

[06-Dec-18 01:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I guess there is much more behind the scenes than just hype of the release

[06-Dec-18 01:05 AM] Torankoku#4818
well actually it makes sense they pick zec actually

[06-Dec-18 01:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Legal stuff, logistics, banking, etc etc etc

[06-Dec-18 01:05 AM] Torankoku#4818
gemini, i think, has zec too

[06-Dec-18 01:05 AM] Torankoku#4818
zec has privacy as option no?

[06-Dec-18 01:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[06-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Torankoku#4818
ah, yes. kmd looking quite hopeful then

[06-Dec-18 01:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For now you can send from zaddr to cb

[06-Dec-18 01:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But you cant create zaddr from cb

[06-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Torankoku#4818
personally, i think pure privacy coins like monero dont stand a chance but niche market

[06-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Torankoku#4818
but with dex, things may change

[06-Dec-18 01:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think they do stand a chance

[06-Dec-18 01:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
As recent as a couple weeks ago the btc was there  to send as soon as payment cleared. You would think with the price dropping they would be pretty flush with coin at the moment. Something more to that i’m sure.

[06-Dec-18 01:07 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If market is there eventually they will get there.

[06-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Torankoku#4818
why? coins listed on coinbase dont usually go up, i think

[06-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Torankoku#4818
only effective on binance

[06-Dec-18 01:08 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
About lock days? That is just protocol for fraud security

[06-Dec-18 01:08 AM] Torankoku#4818
except bitcoin cash crazyness

[06-Dec-18 01:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
On coinbase they dump on the first days, months, but eventually they grow a lot

[06-Dec-18 01:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Especially when the bull comes full force. the coins that get the most injection of fresh money is the ones on cb or similar fiat gateway services

[06-Dec-18 01:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

meh

[06-Dec-18 01:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also zcash works very well in bdex 🙃

[06-Dec-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I always thaught that z-cash being added to large fiat gfateways was a honey pot to see who uses privacy options

[06-Dec-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Becasue z-cash does not enforce privacy its easy for them to tell who uses it and who does not.
