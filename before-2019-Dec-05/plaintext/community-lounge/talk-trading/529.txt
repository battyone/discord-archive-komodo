i disagree, fiat price doesnt matter, i only care about BTC price because that indicates the total % of the crypto space that KMD is

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but there are market making bots on binance that are targeting fiat price

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so it might not matter to you, but that is all that matters to those bots

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i only care about BTC price` 🤦🏽

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
we need to buy all the KMD from those bots

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
until the mispricing gets too big and the bot operators change the settings

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] Caglio#3337
I offer myself to buy all kmd from those bots

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
also there is a bias setting, where the bots can push the price down over time

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Unless they have more than 39 of them

[10-Apr-19 07:08 PM] Caglio#3337
I cannot afford more than 39

[10-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338
fiat is more of a shitcoin than btc is

[10-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Caglio#3337
Its not tho

[10-Apr-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yet, that is what these bots appear to work on

[10-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Caglio#3337
You can put btc on fire

[10-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Caglio#3337
Cant*

[10-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you cant make infinite btc

[10-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Caglio#3337
I cant make infinite fiat either

[10-Apr-19 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alexfrog What happens to your evaluation method if BTC dies? what's your next god in line?

[10-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Magic the gathering cards @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[10-Apr-19 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😂

[10-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
nah i traded all my magic the gathering cards for monero in 2016 😄

[10-Apr-19 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tarot

[10-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
thats how i got into this market 😄

[10-Apr-19 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders about grown men trading "magic cards"_

[10-Apr-19 07:11 PM] Caglio#3337
And few days ago, I saw interesting video, where Rudy ( one of the biggest MTG dealers ), received a collection, bought solely by crypto

[10-Apr-19 07:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC saw my rising wedge comment earlier and told me to go fuck myself

[10-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Annoyed

[10-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Caglio#3337
Seems like a guy earned a lot of money during bull run 2017, and when it started to go down, he changed it all into MTG reserve list cards

[10-Apr-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
you were only a little wrong

[10-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Time to go pester mark hanna on twitter about KMD price

[10-Apr-19 07:15 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if only i was a whale and could buy all the komodo right now

[10-Apr-19 07:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure there's an ocean big enough for that whale

[10-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Caglio#3337
I would pimp out my gf for kmd rn

[10-Apr-19 07:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Genie is right

[10-Apr-19 07:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[10-Apr-19 07:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Send pics

[10-Apr-19 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you couldn't buy "all" of it at $12, it's a hard sell to pump it from $1.10 to more than there

[10-Apr-19 07:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
10 KMD per visit

[10-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Hollowman ( : ❤ hopeless romantic ( :

[10-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i would just buy it all until it wasnt in the low 20ks anymore

[10-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Caglio#3337
I need 380 more KMD

[10-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Caglio#3337
so my collection is valid

[10-Apr-19 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if only math worked that way

[10-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Caglio#3337
I hope I will get those

[10-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pump Tezos to $1000 and I’ll buy more kmd

[10-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Kthxbai

[10-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Alexfrog#1338
pump KMD to $1000 and ill sell and rebuy more KMD on the dump 😄

[10-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Caglio#3337
Btw, I am happy to see Vote tokens will be in mobile wallet

[10-Apr-19 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`pump KMD to $1000 and ill sell and rebuy more KMD on the dump`
Why, you only evaluate on pure BTC, so when BTC drops to $3k, you'll just lose $400k on the deal anyway :troll:

[10-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if i could manage to have 400k worth of something to lose, that would be great 😄

[10-Apr-19 07:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
whut?

[10-Apr-19 07:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if i could manage to have 400k worth of something to lose, that would be great`
said no one that could math (except for a calculated tax deduction) ever

[10-Apr-19 07:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You might as well be saying
> this having means thing sucks, I want to wake up tomorrow and be poor

[10-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Alexfrog#1338
no i was saying i wanted to wake up and have 400k

[10-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and then try not to lose it

[10-Apr-19 07:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and I was saying that if your evaluation system of a currency is based only on BTC and BTC/USD drops, you will fail

[10-Apr-19 07:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and be poor

[10-Apr-19 07:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD is worth 26% more in USD at the current 21-22k sats than it was a month ago at 24k sats

[10-Apr-19 07:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
And I dont give a shit because id rather have KMD dominate crypto.   Rising against USD doesnt matter because USD is shit.  The only real competition is in crypto.

[10-Apr-19 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
man you really don't understand the "currency" part of "crypto**currency**", do you 🤦🏽

[10-Apr-19 07:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i think you just dont understand my statements 😛

[10-Apr-19 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to wholly discount fiat is to live in a bubble waiting to burst

[10-Apr-19 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that you don't get that is why you dream of having 400k and would `try not to lose it` if you had it

[10-Apr-19 07:52 PM] Alexfrog#1338
crypto winning against fiat is just inevitable.   i care more about cryptos with good tech winning against shitty cryptos that are all marketing.

[10-Apr-19 07:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`crypto winning against fiat is just inevitable. `
not in your lifetime

[10-Apr-19 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
those who will see crypto "win against fiat" haven't been born yet

[10-Apr-19 07:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[10-Apr-19 07:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers guide me

[10-Apr-19 07:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
crypto is crushing fiat, it improves by an order of magnitude every 4 years

[10-Apr-19 07:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wherever its going, it needs to take a break

[10-Apr-19 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`crypto is crushing fiat`

[10-Apr-19 07:57 PM] Alexfrog#1338
its called looking at a long term chart

[10-Apr-19 07:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c you ever get your KMD order filled?

[10-Apr-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
show me on this chart where I can buy everything P2P with crypto that I can buy with fiat (and in as may locations)

[10-Apr-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
crypto is tiny little niche right now

[10-Apr-19 07:58 PM] Alexfrog#1338
in the future after some more 4 year periods where it gains an order of magnitude

[10-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A few will

[10-Apr-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`after some more 4 year periods `
yes, about 20 of them

[10-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Burgertokens for hamburgerchain won’t

[10-Apr-19 07:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don’t buy worthless shit

[10-Apr-19 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
burgerchian burgers were crunch and had a heavy iron taste

[10-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yes and this is why i care about the satoshi price...because i care about KMD being one of those winners

[10-Apr-19 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because i care about KMD being one of those winners`
but, you really don't though, or you just literally don't grasp how currency works

[10-Apr-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
not yet. still WTB 50 BTC of KMD, maybe 100 BTC

[10-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Alecandro#1179
You serious you whale bro beans?

[10-Apr-19 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still isn't selling at a paltry $1.20_

[10-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Alexfrog#1338
jl777c, im pretty sure you could sent those btc to binance and get filled at these low prices very quickly

[10-Apr-19 08:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Alexfrog I dont think jl will want to do KYC 😄

[10-Apr-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont use CEX

[10-Apr-19 08:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
he can withdraw 2 btc a day for a month though

[10-Apr-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i prefer to have control of my money

[10-Apr-19 08:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
*i dont use CEX* 
Only SEX

[10-Apr-19 08:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
😂

[10-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you could deposit 2 btc, buy, withdraw, daily for a month then 😄

[10-Apr-19 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
With a CEX, you are literally giving your currency away, every time

[10-Apr-19 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not about amount, it's about not giving it away to someone in exchange for nothing more than a promise

[10-Apr-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and having to mess with things daily for such small amounts

[10-Apr-19 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you learn nothing from those "magic cards"?

[10-Apr-19 08:07 PM] modereck#4269
