Wow, sellers are really hitting that bid hard.

[24-Feb-19 02:16 PM] yorklab#7270
Bitcoin's small dump has just turned into a big dump.

[24-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Likewise#6767
BTC taking a dump

[24-Feb-19 02:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that's a big one  ....

[24-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what . I sold just before a dump üòÑ

[24-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no way

[24-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not possible

[24-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will definatly instantly rebound

[24-Feb-19 02:18 PM] yorklab#7270
Yep

[24-Feb-19 02:18 PM] yorklab#7270
Happening now.

[24-Feb-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wow it did like $500 down from the price I cashed out fiat in holy shit that was lucky

Everyone unloading on that kmd bid.

BTC erased it's 4 days progress in 15 min. So much for the mini bull

Btc is a fickle mistress.

[24-Feb-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that red candle on BTC is crazy

[24-Feb-19 02:25 PM] yorklab#7270
Two-thirds of that bid got wiped out. We'll see if the sellers end up regretting that.

[24-Feb-19 02:26 PM] dxer666#8963
16 btc @ 2550 buy side

[24-Feb-19 02:27 PM] yorklab#7270
Yea, it was 45 btc just a few minutes ago.

[24-Feb-19 02:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[24-Feb-19 02:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe not

[24-Feb-19 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will cleary bounce becaseuI sold at the top, there is no way I'm that lucky.

That s4f sounds like a use case for KV on a assetchain

[24-Feb-19 04:26 PM] Markus#5464
alot of action on binance this sunday, looks like koreans are not up for a run their volume is not the way it use to be

[24-Feb-19 04:32 PM] yorklab#7270
Just saw the tweet that says new Komodo chins will soon have the ability to be Quantum resistant. I would think the entire Blockchain world would be interested in this. I wonder if this is having any effect on the kmd market.

[24-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Markus#5464
strong sellers

[24-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Markus#5464
25.5 wall getting melt

[24-Feb-19 04:33 PM] yorklab#7270
Yea, it's about to disappear.

[24-Feb-19 04:33 PM] yorklab#7270
and there it goes.

[24-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Markus#5464
i sold a small portion at 27 to upgrade my kmd stack, looking to buy back around 24 if possible....if not then 25 is fine also

[24-Feb-19 04:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Retest of newly formed supports now. If this holds, then we might be in a good healthy pullback before higher moves up

BTC is continuing down which probably has a lot to do with .

[24-Feb-19 04:39 PM] Markus#5464

3500 for the most beautiful bear trap.

Failure of tapping high followed by sharp move down shows likelyhood whales are looking for liquidity provided by sellers, further build their position to dump in the 5-6k range.

Maybe I'm wrong, but if nobody else is doing this, and this really is as big as it seems, I would think Marketing would be telling the world........maybe soon?

[24-Feb-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
to be fair i only started on this over the weekend, so it came together really quickly

[24-Feb-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
and the initial dilithium CC is more a proof of concept, to make it a fully functional blockchain payment system that is 100% quantum resistant will require a few more days work, and some GUI support too

[24-Feb-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is some demand for this, I will do it, but I was just helping a student do his homework

[24-Feb-19 05:29 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
JL after yo ufinish write a handbook "DIY: quantum resistance within a weekend" üòõ

[24-Feb-19 05:37 PM] yorklab#7270
Ah, didn't know this was so new. Over a weekend? A few more days? This sounds like something a team of scientists have to create....just amazing. Well jl77c, I suggest you finish your homework. üòÅ

it isnt ready for a fully quantum resistant chain as change isnt supported, so just a proof of concept using CC for rapid development. latest research crypto algo in a live blockchain, over the weekend

[24-Feb-19 06:22 PM] Markus#5464
would been nice if we also had a kmd/usdt pair on binance ^^

also get the background story of the kids homework. Sounds interesting

[24-Feb-19 06:45 PM] tolken#2655
Nah, I‚Äôn about a year, another project like Neo, Eos, or Tron will claim they have the first quantum resistance chains.  @yorklab

[24-Feb-19 06:45 PM] CHMEX#0686
your inverse sha256 algo might be useless soon hollowman

[24-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
This is troubling

[24-Feb-19 06:47 PM] tolken#2655
@CHMEX I believe the proper technical term is ‚ÄúInverse sha256‚Äù don‚Äôt mix the two, potentially catastrophic results.

[24-Feb-19 06:48 PM] CHMEX#0686

[24-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
This is double trouble

[24-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there are a variety of quantum resistant algos being submitted to NIST for the post-quantum era

[24-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
dilithium is one of these new algos

[24-Feb-19 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
since CC allows to add new consensus rules to komodo chains, i made it so you need to have a valid dilithium signature to be able to spend funds

[24-Feb-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
since komodo architecture allows a custom CC chain to inherit all the rest, in literally a weekend, I created a chain that is able to generate dilithium keypairs, send funds to a pubkey and spend those funds using a privkey

[24-Feb-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
unlike other quantum resistant algos, dilithium appears to allow pubkey reuse

[24-Feb-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
will dilithium be the officially selected algo? maybe, maybe not. if not, i will have to spend another weekend adding a different algo

[24-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
Can you dumb this down for me? What additional protections would this offer? Would this only be helpful in the event that sha256 is broken?

[24-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So I need to ditch my closet full of illicit quantum computers and make you all witness to the power of my fully armed and operational multiverse computer?

[24-Feb-19 06:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
how can anything be quantum resistant before quantum computing?

[24-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The theoretical capabilities of a quantum computer are known

[24-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Therefore, you create schemes difficult enough to hinder them

[24-Feb-19 06:56 PM] nocturnal#2177
how many qbits are assumed??

[24-Feb-19 06:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
moreover how can you encrypt strongly enough with a classical computer that cant be cracked with a quantum computer
