Waiting for 100k sats

[16-Mar-19 10:07 PM] Markus#5464
That will have to wait quite sometime then :troll_thuglife:

[16-Mar-19 10:10 PM] yorklab#7270
Maybe. Who knows really.

[16-Mar-19 10:11 PM] Markus#5464
If it happen before rebrand unless some rly big news appear then it would be strange to go almost 4x

[16-Mar-19 10:47 PM] jspook16#3059
Rebrand is coming..

[16-Mar-19 10:48 PM] Markus#5464
sure but isnt that planned for like Q3 Q4 or something like that?

[16-Mar-19 10:57 PM] crumb#2550
depends in what order they roll it out. remeber that this rebrand is not just new visual identity, but complete overhaul of explaining what komodo is / does / consists of

[16-Mar-19 10:57 PM] crumb#2550
all this is done over period of time

[16-Mar-19 11:00 PM] ph03nix#3115
kmd was at 120k sats a few days ago :troll:

[16-Mar-19 11:01 PM] crumb#2550

I meant Winter is coming..

[17-Mar-19 12:26 AM] KS_AMS#8403
@jspook16 we are already by winter, but I think that with Bittrex, Huobi... and the success of the Team with next Timeline... the coin will back to 90k sats

[17-Mar-19 12:27 AM] Markus#5464
he was not serious about winter xD

[17-Mar-19 12:27 AM] KS_AMS#8403
@ph03nix you mean a few months ago, like one year?

[17-Mar-19 12:27 AM] Markus#5464
it was 120k few days ago on huobi

[17-Mar-19 12:28 AM] KS_AMS#8403
Yes, because it was opening, this is normal for every exchange when it is opening but not a real price

[17-Mar-19 12:28 AM] Markus#5464
not rly opening, rather a pump

[17-Mar-19 12:29 AM] Markus#5464
pretty sure they did that to make ppl deposit and start trading komodo on huobi

[17-Mar-19 12:29 AM] KS_AMS#8403
yes but just a few seconds or minutes

[17-Mar-19 12:30 AM] KS_AMS#8403
one thing I can sure you... the coin is come to a better position

[17-Mar-19 12:30 AM] KS_AMS#8403
but it requires more volume

[17-Mar-19 12:30 AM] Markus#5464
was 2 hours actually

[17-Mar-19 12:30 AM] Markus#5464
xD

[17-Mar-19 12:32 AM] Markus#5464
volume will come by itself when they start announcing rebrand step by step when ppl will start realizing what they have really made

[17-Mar-19 12:41 AM] KS_AMS#8403
this was just an opening door

[17-Mar-19 12:41 AM] KS_AMS#8403
it's not a real volume

[17-Mar-19 12:41 AM] KS_AMS#8403
normally this is very badly interpreted

[17-Mar-19 12:42 AM] KS_AMS#8403
Maybe the reason why is dumping

Total Market Cap:

Steadily rising volume since January, and we've now broken out of a 15-month downtrend.

Bears in disbelief.

if march closes above, april will form support and it will be a matter of time before we do a huge move up

supposedly, the bear was pushed by the gox sell off (not sure how much positive belief I have in that theory, but that's how the theory goes)

[17-Mar-19 02:45 PM] bishop#9773
@Cryptoon I'd like to see that Patel chart get above the pivot high of Feb/March before confirming this as a breakout of the downtrend.

hilarious- for starters, using the term 'haircut' is illegitimate..

[18-Mar-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
it's a stretch to go from a loan/leverage term to use for deposit holders, but not really "illegitimate"

[18-Mar-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
at a core level, your deposit is, in fact, collateral

[18-Mar-19 03:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
lol .. it is silly metaphor in the first place, and in this context it is downright derisive and cynical

[18-Mar-19 03:22 PM] LocoMB#8593
buuut: not your keys, not your coins ... ‚ò† collateral is what fiat deposits have become in preparation of expropriaton, so why not call it that in centralilzed crypto too

[18-Mar-19 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
well CEXs are banks, so there's that

[18-Mar-19 03:26 PM] LocoMB#8593
'haircut' implies an evenly applied cropping over a whole  topology (human head), usually not understood to raze each and every hair down to a Bhudda like bald skull, but an even takeback with some residue

[18-Mar-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`usually not understood to raze each and every hair down to a Bhudda like bald skull`
agreed, but that's inherent in the risk factor of the space as a whole
