all those pretty lines 😮 👏🏽

[11-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Keppie#5156
is ARRR/KMD closed on DP or just 0 volume??

[11-Jun-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
0 volume as nobody wants to sell at such current prices and many are dealing with KMD refunds to be able to buy up the cheap ARRR

[11-Jun-19 02:16 PM] p.#1126
Where is best place to buy ARRR

[11-Jun-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
with KMD, digitalprice has the most liquidity

[11-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Malti#3948

[11-Jun-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
Does anybody know how long withdraws have been disabled on DP?

[11-Jun-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
KMD:
Withdrawal temporary disabled for this coin
Deposits have been disabled for maintenance
```

[11-Jun-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
next week it will be enabled

[11-Jun-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's my own fault for not checking, but I am angry it let me deposit and didn't tell me

[11-Jun-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
I never leave my coins on an exchange more than a few hours. This is my own fault, and yet, as a DP customer, I feel that it's very scammy and shady

[11-Jun-19 03:10 PM] tolken#2655
How does a cex prevent one from depositing? You mean there was no warning that deposits wouldn’t be accessible?

[11-Jun-19 04:09 PM] nael55#5863
they can't stop you from "depositing", but they can make it so the deposit doesn't show up/isnt' spendable from your login

[11-Jun-19 04:09 PM] nael55#5863
a few weeks ago binance disabled deposits but you could still send to the wallet and the deposit would credit

[11-Jun-19 04:11 PM] private guy#0631
Does anyone know when coinexchange.io will allow trading again for Komodo assets? They’re in maintenance, since shortly after the vulnerability discovery.

[11-Jun-19 04:13 PM] nael55#5863
don't hold your breath for CE

[11-Jun-19 04:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[11-Jun-19 04:13 PM] private guy#0631
@dukeleto what exchange is DP an abbreviation for? can’t be double penetration, although that’s probably how it feels

thanks, although Dong felt right. Is Phrasing a thing here?

[11-Jun-19 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`although Dong felt right. `
that's called "an over-share"

@MadMaX were you going to be sending notary dividends to all of the compromised addresses that voted for you? :abusedsmily:

[12-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol good point

[12-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i guess notaries that pay rewards for voters need to get info on where to send

[12-Jun-19 04:08 AM] Alecandro#1179
How is it that trading volume is so low on KMD??

[12-Jun-19 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody wants to sell at this price

[12-Jun-19 05:26 AM] Alecandro#1179
How is there no buy volume either though?? Haha

@Keppie you cant withdraw from dp, and cant deposit on other sites, so arbi not really possible atm

For many kinds of work there are three phases:

1. When nothing's working.

2. When it's working, but only your initial users/audience realize that.

3. When everyone knows it works.

Phase 2 is the most fun. Enjoy it while it lasts, because you'll miss it in phase 3.

[12-Jun-19 11:45 AM] Malti#3948
