@Cryptoon (Cryptoon#3362)
You rained **5 KMD** onto 250 online user(s)
**(0.02 KMD)** each

[17-Nov-18 01:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
pls dump your vrsc bags into my orders thank you

[17-Nov-18 02:00 PM] lancelott#6785
@Cryptoon woot nice, thanks bud

[17-Nov-18 02:02 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
Mooorreeeee kmd

[17-Nov-18 02:02 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
Thanks so much, I love you a little bit

[17-Nov-18 02:03 PM] snowdamn#2414
@jl777c do you think almost all BTC used to rent hash (for BCH wars) is being sold for USD by the renters?
i wonder what the immediate effect will be once they stop renting for this specifically
but who knows where BTC/USD will be by then FML

[17-Nov-18 02:03 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
I remember when someone rained 777 kmd

[17-Nov-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it is an insignificant amount. $1 million per day is a lot to burn for bragging rights

[17-Nov-18 02:07 PM] javadth#4536
thanq for raining

[17-Nov-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but compared to the billions per day of trading it is less than 0.1%, so what meaningful effect can that have?

{Reactions}
üëÜüèº 

[17-Nov-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems that after months of keeping the price stable, whoever was doing that decided to stop and maybe it just adjusted to what it would have been, just all at once, like an earthquake

[17-Nov-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
or they pushed it down so they can buy more OTC at a discount

[17-Nov-18 02:09 PM] snowdamn#2414
yeah, you're right, i asked the wrong question
if anything, the sell pressure is for covering big miners' costs (due to currently dumped price)

[17-Nov-18 02:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont think the fall had anything to do with the BCH fork drama

[17-Nov-18 02:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if there was selling of BTC it was not the day that the market collapsed.

[17-Nov-18 02:13 PM] snowdamn#2414
do you guys think big miners will have to start pulling the plug on some of their hash power?
has anyone looked at the #s?

[17-Nov-18 02:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes... not the big ones though... the smaller operations

[17-Nov-18 02:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the operations that started in 2017/2018 are at loss now.

[17-Nov-18 02:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
big ones have deals with big powerplants

[17-Nov-18 02:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
very very very cheap power

[17-Nov-18 02:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or even free

[17-Nov-18 02:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They have contracts to take the excess power generated by hydroelectric or nuclear facilities

[17-Nov-18 02:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also big one build their own miners... like bitmain. Which help them get a big advantage over the overall market

[17-Nov-18 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this was expected though

[17-Nov-18 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it didnt make sense that hashrate kept climbing while price has been going down.

[17-Nov-18 02:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Cryptoon  no such thing as excess power,  electricity is a flow not a static thing.   @siu - Chainmakers  not all farms,  been up for only a month about halfway recovered , thank you pirate üòÉ

[17-Nov-18 02:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*a* move was a expected

[17-Nov-18 02:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
up or down

[17-Nov-18 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@polycryptoblog im referring to BTC mining specifically

[17-Nov-18 02:19 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes

[17-Nov-18 02:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@polycryptoblog sure there is

[17-Nov-18 02:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Oh yea those guys are screwed lol

[17-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
more electricity can be generated than is consumed

[17-Nov-18 02:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it is a good thing that miners turn off their miners for some time though

[17-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
By processes that you dont necessarily control such as water movement

[17-Nov-18 02:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
a diff adjustment would make sense to give some breathing room for later.

[17-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok you can shut down the valves and build up water for a while

[17-Nov-18 02:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But why would you do that if you could use it to power bitcoin miners instead

[17-Nov-18 02:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because the marginal cost is next to zero

[17-Nov-18 02:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hydro plants dam water to create enough head to generate force to move the impellers.  But that isn't storing power though.   If a generator isn't tapped at max capacity it isn't wasting power,  it's just that not being used to its full potential.   Basically every load that gets attached increases the amount of current drawn ( how parallel circuits work ) ,  generator windings can only handle so much current .  You push it you break the generator.   Force to turn impeller increases with amount of current drawn due to Fleming right hand rule.  Only ways to "store" electric is batteries and capacitors both have limitations on heavy sustained load applications.

[17-Nov-18 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm not saying you force them to generate more

[17-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm saying if demand is lower than what can be generated

[17-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
excess is nearly free

[17-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and gives you bitcoin with nearly zero marginal cost

[17-Nov-18 02:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If you are generating your own yes that works.

[17-Nov-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'd my ping just the tip not?

[17-Nov-18 02:37 PM] yorklab#7270
I've been hearing a lot about how the bear market is going to kill off a lot of bad projects; but I think this could kill off many more:

How SEC's Paragon Ruling Could Send Many Crypto ICOs to Bankruptcy
The recent crackdown on Paragon and AirFox by the SEC could lead to many blockchain and crypto projects declaring bankruptcy in the coming months.

[17-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Why would a government be Able to stop a thing which is unregulated and outside of their control?

[17-Nov-18 02:41 PM] yorklab#7270
Just saying that the combination of bad projects, bear market and  government rulings will weed out a lot of projects.

[17-Nov-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not this one

[17-Nov-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm about to put my face on this... Australian gov can eat a dick

[17-Nov-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Build a system they can't control

[17-Nov-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Fuk em seriously

[17-Nov-18 02:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A lot of those targeted by sec are companies

[17-Nov-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot or all?

[17-Nov-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Kmd isn't a target?

[17-Nov-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and most seem to be ERC20 without their own blockchain

[17-Nov-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If btc is... We have issues

[17-Nov-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If not rt he. No

[17-Nov-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
btc is in the clear

yassinkomodo 

[17-Nov-18 02:45 PM] yorklab#7270
A lot, not all. I think the SEC is going after many that are US related and ICOed after the SEC had come out with some basic guidlines. I think Komodo is safe by that standard.

[17-Nov-18 02:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Some are individuals,  not sure about this round of busts . but I do remember them going after like shrem and shavers individually but not 100 percent positive on that.

[17-Nov-18 02:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think that KMD will stand out in this fight because of the capability of doing mined coins.

[17-Nov-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Btc to 1000 has always been somethig. I'm prepared for

[17-Nov-18 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i think shrem already signed some agreement where he agreed not to do any more fund raising in crypto, then he raised more funds

[17-Nov-18 02:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ICO crackdown will bring people back to the old mining shitcoins days.

[17-Nov-18 02:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
yeah, telling projects they need to go back to a model without a token is an overreach
but if your company is in their jurisdiction they can do whatever
probably end up only with fines, can't see how they can force the no token model

[17-Nov-18 02:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
none of the things happening have to do with bitcoin... it has more to do with ETH and the shift in mentality we saw happening in 2016 - 2017

[17-Nov-18 02:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we knew this would happen... and even if it is bad now, in the long run it will be good.

[17-Nov-18 02:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
fines for having received funds, tax+penalty
only projects under a company model

[17-Nov-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But s fine is only a tobe if u pay it

[17-Nov-18 02:50 PM] snowdamn#2414
rephrase please lol

[17-Nov-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah soZ.. A fine is only a fine if u choose to pay it

[17-Nov-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Every fine given to me I took to court

[17-Nov-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Even of if it was pountless

[17-Nov-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And I would lose

[17-Nov-18 02:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
imo after ETH erc20 tokens came out, it was like if everyone forgot what blockchain was.

[17-Nov-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It breaks their system.

[17-Nov-18 02:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, but most will to continue operating, especially if SEC lets them keep the tokens

[17-Nov-18 02:52 PM] yorklab#7270
In the end, all the crap could be weeded  out with Komodo benefiting from the fallout.

[17-Nov-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Komodo will win.. Becuz we have working g solutions s

[17-Nov-18 02:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's not the token that's the issue,  but the fundraising that was done for it .    I think we will be fine,  if Ethereum falls under the exemption they did then we sure as hell do and we have been proactive and sought a legal opinion on Komodos status.  Also big issue with prosecuting since no company,  person or persons who did ICO is known and there isn't any defined jurisdiction .

[17-Nov-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was with a millionaire tonight fro. China when I described kmd to him he asked me if it was the next bill gate's

[17-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
True

[17-Nov-18 03:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
this is how i see it
they say well you accepted funds without registering
that's a no no
you have to pay tax+penalty
fine (pun)
ok, now in order to continue operating you need to end tokens
not fine
most will pay fine and switch jurisdiction
will be a cheap way out for projects that held ICO when BTC price was low
suicide for all others

[17-Nov-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
S d I day no

[17-Nov-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
