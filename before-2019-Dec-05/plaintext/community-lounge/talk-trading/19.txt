Pron isn't a worldwide event that costs billions of dollars to put together so a few teams can play each other.

cuck: antiquated term brought back in 2016 and slung more *by*  more people the term defines than *to*  people the term defines

[24-Jun-18 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If you can't mine equishash with elect under $1 USD and still make profit, then you need to get a haircut and a real job before you attempt any investing, period

[24-Jun-18 04:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Never looked into actually mining with hardware though. But if you say its profitable il take a quick geez

[24-Jun-18 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
