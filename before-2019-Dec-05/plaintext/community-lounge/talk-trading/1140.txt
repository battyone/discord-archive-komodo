[15-Sep-19 05:29 PM] jorian#4555

@LocoMB are you bald?

[15-Sep-19 05:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
sounds like you are watching the wrong type of movies

[15-Sep-19 05:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
but, I have been mistaken for Bruce Willis occasionally after barber visits

`>> bullying a 40 year old man

When a troll gets trolled, you're supposed to feel sorry that the troll got trolled?
🤔

[15-Sep-19 05:34 PM] Tek#5253
they made my fren & serverdad leave discord

[15-Sep-19 05:34 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Sep-19 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you have no friends

[15-Sep-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
nice projecting

[15-Sep-19 05:35 PM] LocoMB#8593
let's wait for conclusion of k63 drama

[15-Sep-19 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@LocoMB don't hold your breath waiting for that; you'll die of lack of oxygen

[15-Sep-19 05:36 PM] LocoMB#8593
good point - I have no skin in that game, so I won't ..
but will be interesting to see exactly how long this will drag out

[15-Sep-19 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most don't but that doesn't stop them from spinning up more shit about it

[15-Sep-19 05:37 PM] LocoMB#8593
crypto is notoriously sensitive to these shenanigans coz fallout of that stuff unfortunatley can do a lot damage to legit projects

[15-Sep-19 05:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and if he left all of the space "over drama" in select discord servers then he needs to dust the sand out of his panties

[15-Sep-19 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's kinda hard to use that as an excuse when you're one of the people that's started drama for fun over the years 🤷🏽

[15-Sep-19 05:39 PM] Tek#5253
he left because his reputation was ruined

[15-Sep-19 05:39 PM] Tek#5253
thats what he said

[15-Sep-19 05:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he had one?

[15-Sep-19 05:39 PM] Tek#5253
dunno, i don't care about kmd discord

[15-Sep-19 05:39 PM] Tek#5253
it's the least interesting discord im in, in all honesty

[15-Sep-19 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from my chair, his "reputation" was a shit starting drama queen (and that's what I liked about him)

[15-Sep-19 05:40 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[15-Sep-19 05:41 PM] LocoMB#8593
oh come on, the current drama levels are nothing compared to 2014-2016

[15-Sep-19 05:42 PM] LocoMB#8593
* I don't miss that shit really, but it seems like era of exciting new tech icos is mostly over

[15-Sep-19 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's only the new folks who believe that emmanuel cannot start as much drama as he pretends to try to stop 😛

[15-Sep-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253
i don't even know what you old men r talkin bout

[15-Sep-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253
i never seen any drama here

[15-Sep-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253
>> old man drama

[15-Sep-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253

[15-Sep-19 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[15-Sep-19 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I would, but it was too shitty to finish watching the 1st time

[15-Sep-19 05:47 PM] LocoMB#8593
yaaa... second half drags on a bit I think- I'll check out some new stuff

[15-Sep-19 05:48 PM] LocoMB#8593
lol... what about Terminator 6 or whatever it is, Arnold being over 70 now-
and then they serioulsy did another Rambo, and Tom Cruise still pretends to be 25 in yet another Top Gun movie

[15-Sep-19 05:49 PM] LocoMB#8593
Even Jason Statham is over 50- and you can see it in the latest megashark movie

[15-Sep-19 06:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Terminator series ended with T2

[15-Sep-19 06:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[15-Sep-19 06:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Had a wedding party this weekend so missed a lot of drama it seems 😃

[15-Sep-19 06:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Emman left because his reputation was tarnished what is that all about?

[15-Sep-19 06:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Even left oot discord while he was a dev there? Wtf

[15-Sep-19 06:51 PM] tolken#2655
Terminator series ended with the first terminator. In other words, there really wasn’t ever a series.

[15-Sep-19 06:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Silence, heretic

[15-Sep-19 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

💔 

[15-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But how was his rep tarnished then besides how he was throwing in his own windows by publicly defending k64 for example?

[15-Sep-19 07:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(Not that theres anything wrong with that)

[15-Sep-19 07:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But he was VERY persistent
