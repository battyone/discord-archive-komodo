yeah it normally retrace, but during the bear market, but we'll never know whether it has actually ended or not

[20-Dec-18 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
it will never go up vertical straight after a fierce downtrend

[20-Dec-18 06:08 PM] Vertigo#0439
Things like BCH pumping makes me angry at the crypto space... It should be dead after all they've done.

it is deinflating

I think 10% per day gain would be possible, any more than that ane likely it will pullback and even 10% per day is very steep rising

with a 90 block gap, how is SV still a thing?

[20-Dec-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
because it is a different chain and chain length is irrelevant

[20-Dec-18 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
so sv ignores sv of "longest, most secure chain"? :trollface:

not sure why such variance month to month

[20-Dec-18 07:26 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

maybe part of the reason for recent price action, but it seems too good to be true

not sure how CCID scores on each criteria, but compared to last  month, the criteria Komodo that improves the most is "Innovation"

[20-Dec-18 08:40 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[20-Dec-18 11:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
after 1 year the wallet is still very buggy, and doesn't have the possibility to run as light node ...

[20-Dec-18 11:44 PM] tolken#2655

i love the agama wallet and the  "claim" button

[21-Dec-18 09:20 AM] dokrates#8987
its better than staking because its adding coins each few seconds to the claim amount

[21-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Vertigo#0439
Yeah the claim button is like a mama bird feeding its baby with delicious komodos.

[21-Dec-18 10:54 AM] ver_User#6608
looks like a pretty serious setup on daily for a good run now in kmd, would not be surprised if this goes above 50k sats

altbtc setups are primed across the board IMO

[21-Dec-18 10:58 AM] dokrates#8987
honestly im in strat since long time, but i also look for nice projects

[21-Dec-18 10:58 AM] dokrates#8987
i found komodo some months ago, and i started to realize how cool it is

[21-Dec-18 10:59 AM] dokrates#8987
and i was a little disapointed with the waves and stratis bullrun of past days/weeks in relation to komodo

[21-Dec-18 10:59 AM] dokrates#8987
i don't think komodo deserves to have such low price

[21-Dec-18 10:59 AM] dokrates#8987
It is very undervalued

[21-Dec-18 11:00 AM] dokrates#8987
i also have some pirates, and really like the project, born from komodo devels

[21-Dec-18 11:00 AM] dokrates#8987
komodo and every project around it i think have a very nice future

[21-Dec-18 11:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Waves pumped 400% because someone invested 120m in a private chain. Investors do not realize that even if that were true........it means they will focus more on the private chain and utility that would have gone to waves, will not.

Obviously someone/people front running it since news were just released yesterday it seems.

[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] ver_User#6608
@dokrates also it may help to just think of those bullruns as a warmup... some pairs getting twitchy when they see what's coming for the whole space... also pump and dump groups/whales (and just experienced traders) will want to cycle and take profits from one and put into another, so consider the possibility those pumps just serving that purpose ;)

you'll see similar behaviour in USD forex pairs. USD index may be ready for a sell off, but some pairs will move ahead, some will lag, but eventually they all correlate on some level during major USD moves. 

as hyperdex says there seems to have been some news to use, but often news just serves as a means to an end that would exist with or without news IMO

[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Plus this is basically Ardor lol

[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah it's kind like how people think a bank would actually use their xrp as means of exchange on their private setups. delusions abound

[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
In any case, once people take profits from waves, they will look into getting coins that have not pumped.

[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] dokrates#8987
yes, looks like waves and stratis now are going down, many sells of big amounts i see

[21-Dec-18 11:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So sooner or later KMD will get its day. But i would rather people buy in knowing what KMD can do, rather than blind faith that we are due for a pump because we have not pumped.

Personally I reckon it'll be years or even decades before crypto volatility dies down to reasonable levels. Still too young, speculative, emotional and not enough hedgers or large interests milking every opportunity both directions with liquidity to support them

[21-Dec-18 11:26 AM] ver_User#6608
Plus large holders still can push market very easily, intentionally or unintentionally, wealth is not dispersed enough
