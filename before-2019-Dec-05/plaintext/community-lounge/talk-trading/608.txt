morning

[07-May-19 09:01 AM] Tek#5253
@Markus well well, look at butts, seems like it broke whatever line you had in mind as "heavy resistance"

[07-May-19 09:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
ouch

[07-May-19 09:17 AM] Tek#5253
kmd still stuck at 1860

[07-May-19 09:17 AM] Tek#5253
not sure what to do, bought at this price yesterday

[07-May-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
sell at 1861 for massive profits

[07-May-19 09:19 AM] ph03nix#3115
rebuy at 1862

[07-May-19 09:24 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[07-May-19 09:25 AM] Tek#5253
it does look like its about to make a decently sized green candle upwards

[07-May-19 09:26 AM] Tek#5253
on the hourly atleast

[07-May-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, then wait patiently for 18630

[07-May-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD basically went sideways as BTC went up 5%

[07-May-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the sell bots dont have enough inventory to push through a small 15BTC fence, so they avoid it

[07-May-19 09:41 AM] klein#5233
nah sell now

[07-May-19 09:42 AM] klein#5233
buy back at 18599

[07-May-19 09:46 AM] klein#5233
@Tek if the underlying reason why you bought hasn't changed, don't be concerned with people opinions here, unless it  is something fundamental like the zcash vulnerability

[07-May-19 09:47 AM] klein#5233
sounds like you are trying to flip coins for a few thousand sats

[07-May-19 09:48 AM] Tek#5253
for some extra KMD : D

[07-May-19 09:48 AM] klein#5233
which is like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller when you are trading an instrument that can move 30% in day

[07-May-19 09:48 AM] Tek#5253
if it drops 30% bc of the buttcoin run though.

[07-May-19 09:54 AM] klein#5233
yes that is always a possibility, make your own decisions and make your own mistakes not someone elses

@LocoMB unverified account?

[07-May-19 10:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Those got the axe two years ago

[07-May-19 10:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Binance has 2btc/day withdraw limit for unverified

[07-May-19 10:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I wouldnâ€™t bother with bittIRS anymore

[07-May-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
@Markus first $5500 was the really hard to get past resistance, then it was $5800. what is the next one?

[07-May-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the price of BTC seems to go up without news, which is indicative of bull market, just as going down without news was indicative of bear market

[07-May-19 10:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
5900, 5950, 5975, 5999, 20000, and finally a mcafee-penis-saving 1000000

[07-May-19 10:15 AM] Tek#5253
some dude on biz predicted $5300 in april

[07-May-19 10:15 AM] Tek#5253
he said $9000 in july

[07-May-19 10:18 AM] Markus#5464
@jl777c never said anything about 5800 as far as i can remember beside it being on top of the channel which then retraced to 5500. Biggest resistance is yet 6-7k.

[07-May-19 10:19 AM] Markus#5464
Sure we can break it but we can also get fucked and find out all this was a massive bulltrap

[07-May-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so BTC $1800!

[07-May-19 10:19 AM] Markus#5464
anything is possible ðŸ˜„

[07-May-19 10:20 AM] Markus#5464
what goes up must come down

[07-May-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
only if it is cyclical

[07-May-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
even with gravity you can reach escape velocity

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘Œ 

[07-May-19 10:21 AM] Markus#5464
well anything can happen but it would be abit strange if bull market begins like this, we broke through 4.2k and never tested it again and also never tested support from 200 daily ma

[07-May-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
did you adjust for fiat inflation?

[07-May-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 200 ma is a bit different if inflation is taken into account

[07-May-19 10:22 AM] Markus#5464
adjust what

[07-May-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the USD values

[07-May-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if they doubled USD money supply during the 200 days, it seems nonsense to treat all the values with the same weight

[07-May-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
not saying they doubled the money supply, but I never trusted the official inflation rate numbers

[07-May-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it is usually a lot higher in reality

[07-May-19 10:23 AM] Markus#5464
USD printing is not rly a new thing so why should it affect so much now and not before

[07-May-19 10:23 AM] Tek#5253
it looks like the next few days might be a alt + bitcoin run

[07-May-19 10:23 AM] Tek#5253
guess the bottoms on alts are all exhausted

[07-May-19 10:24 AM] Markus#5464
I feel like there is too much moon hope, lets first see what will happen to 6-7k resistance and take it from there

[07-May-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
just because I believe bear is over does not mean i believe BTC $20k is around the corner

[07-May-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
my sense is that BTC will just gradually climb the "wall of worry"

[07-May-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
and it will take its time to retrace back up to $20k and it wont be in any straight line either

[07-May-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so the normal 10% to 15% corrections along the way

[07-May-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
Ppl start to talk about BTC reaching 10k end of summer its taking it way too far too quick

[07-May-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why I said a pullback to $5600 is fully expected

[07-May-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and it came very close

[07-May-19 10:26 AM] Markus#5464
U think we will break 6-7k resistance in 1 go?

[07-May-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
seems very unlikely

[07-May-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is stairstepping now

[07-May-19 10:27 AM] Tek#5253
it all depends on how the short positions are man

[07-May-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it does a 10% jump up, but more likely 3% to 5% each "step"

[07-May-19 10:27 AM] Tek#5253
if there's huge shorts to be rekt in 6k to 7k it might shoot up in a day

[07-May-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
with a pullback of half or so within each step

[07-May-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464
when it comes to shorts thats just manipulation then from bitfinex/bitmex

[07-May-19 10:28 AM] Tek#5253
big candles only happen when shorts get rekt.

[07-May-19 10:28 AM] Tek#5253
( for bitcoin )

[07-May-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the up move on daily seems like it isnt to the halfway mark yet though, so not so crazy to get to $7k in the next month

[07-May-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
$1000 is "only" 1/6th 16.67%

[07-May-19 10:29 AM] Tek#5253
I watched order books of various alts for hours yesterday. they are (for the onces I watched) all super exhausted

[07-May-19 10:29 AM] Tek#5253
no sellers

[07-May-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so three 5% days in a row and we are there

[07-May-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, it can easily correct 15% at anytime

[07-May-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so we can be back at $5100 or pushing $7000 at about the same likelihoods

[07-May-19 10:30 AM] Markus#5464
Whats your take on stochastic RSI being topped out for so long, can we enter a bullmarket with such condition?

[07-May-19 10:30 AM] Markus#5464
on weekly

[07-May-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
such things are only valid if the total supply of funds in the system is relatively static

[07-May-19 10:30 AM] Tek#5253
I think indicators like RSI are useless in crypto

[07-May-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
if fiat world funds start to flood in, then throw away all the rsi and whatever other indicators

[07-May-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but even in mainstream press, they are now making fun of the "bitcoin is based on nothing" critics

[07-May-19 10:31 AM] Tek#5253
I'm thinking the next run will be the last one where you can easily 10x

[07-May-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and with the recent change (intentional) of the crypto press from "end of the world" to "bull market again" they are working to condition the new generation of newbs to buy

[07-May-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
this is my main indicator of why i think we are in bull market, the press bias is for the most part bullish now

[07-May-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
which means the people that pay for press changed from paying for bearish articles to bullish

{Reactions}
ðŸ’¯ 

[07-May-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
Shouldnt forget that when everyone are being bullish often the opposite happen to make new investors get rekt

[07-May-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
like in 2017 everyone was hyping bitcoin many ppl bought 15k+

[07-May-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
all got fucked

[07-May-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
after the years of bearish press, it will take more than a few months of bullish press to reverse it

[07-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
takes 6 months of sustained conditioning to get people to adapt to the "new reality"

[07-May-19 10:34 AM] Tek#5253
@jl777c what price would you like for KMD to have / achieve?

[07-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at the price and while bear market is over, we are only recovered back to Nov 2018 price, so we cant really feel this is "everyone is bullish" mode yet

[07-May-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
in the long term, I would be happy with KMD having 1% of overall crypto marketcap, but that is totally arbitrary, it could be that the komodo ecosystem garners 10%+ of overall crypto marketcap in the coming decades, will KMD have 10% of the ecosystem marketcap? more ? less?

[07-May-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
I think at 1% of crypto market cap, I would think about start selling my rewards

[07-May-19 10:37 AM] Malti#3948
And get us al rekt

[07-May-19 10:38 AM] Malti#3948
:troll_king:

[07-May-19 10:39 AM] Tek#5253
okay

[07-May-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
In any case: buy bitcoin.

[07-May-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
And then some KMD

[07-May-19 10:41 AM] Tek#5253
whalebro wall is being dumped into

[07-May-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
its over, bail out while you can
