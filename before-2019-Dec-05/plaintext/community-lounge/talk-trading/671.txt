Costco only has black and blue left :troll:

Shoulda got more pirate...

[22-May-19 03:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Itâ€™s stalled at the moment

[22-May-19 03:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Choice is yours

[22-May-19 03:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Decent chunk at 1286

Marketing lol

[22-May-19 05:42 AM] Bittersweet#9376
@Tek disappointed by your little talk yesterday â˜¹

[22-May-19 06:18 AM] Malti#3948
As a belgian i can understand (to a point) where tek is coming from, however I see it as a responsibility to myself to go to work and not rely on benefits even though I dread being in an office from 9-7.

[22-May-19 06:24 AM] jorian#4555
had to scroll back to see what kind of profiteur tek is ðŸ˜„

[22-May-19 06:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I just hate that I have to pay for that kind of shit that profit from the system. But in truth if such a thing is possible then the system is flawed

[22-May-19 06:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Haha idd

[22-May-19 06:25 AM] jorian#4555
same happens in NL though, the hard working paying for those lazy feks

[22-May-19 06:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And itâ€™s a lot worse in brussels/ the southern side of the country

[22-May-19 06:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
25% unemployment in brussels etc

[22-May-19 06:26 AM] jorian#4555
southern side of belgium are french right?

[22-May-19 06:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah

[22-May-19 06:26 AM] jorian#4555
that explains lol

[22-May-19 06:26 AM] jorian#4555
those are really lazy lol

[22-May-19 06:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Some are I guess

[22-May-19 06:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Some mean well and are fed up as well

[22-May-19 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But the problem is when some are exploiting the system, that doesnt really motivate others to go out and work hard when they see that others are just taking advantage

[22-May-19 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So itâ€™s a system that enforces itself

[22-May-19 06:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Like Tek says, â€˜if others are doing it why shouldnt I do it?â€™

[22-May-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
like a mining system where the ones with the lowest hashrate gets the block

[22-May-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a bit backwards

[22-May-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but as automation takes over more and more jobs, some solution is needed for the unemployable, which will become the majority of people

[22-May-19 06:31 AM] jorian#4555
unemployable implies that you can't work. Tek seems fit to work

[22-May-19 06:31 AM] jorian#4555
just chooses not to

[22-May-19 06:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
i think with more automation, the entertainment industry will become a main growth driver

[22-May-19 06:31 AM] jorian#4555
Europe also faces the fact that in 20 years 30% of the population will be too old to work (unemployable) and the younger generation will need to find a way to pay for their pension

[22-May-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but how will people pay for the entertainment?

[22-May-19 06:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Work in entertainment!

[22-May-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
when most all office jobs are totally automated...

[22-May-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and physical labor is also automated...

[22-May-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you are creating the automation, there are not so many jobs. not sure how good robots would be at being a chef, so maybe restaurants are safe for a bit longer

[22-May-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be people that in all past generations would be very productive people, but cant compete against the automation.

[22-May-19 06:34 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Tek is my Ahmed

[22-May-19 06:35 AM] Bittersweet#9376
I'll just put it like that

[22-May-19 06:35 AM] Malti#3948
being a barber seems to be a safe choice tbh. Wouldn't want a robot to shave me (aka be with a sharp knife in the face/neck area) lol

[22-May-19 06:35 AM] Bittersweet#9376
The system has its flaws but that's a fact

[22-May-19 06:36 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Also no reward is a bit of an exaggeration

[22-May-19 06:36 AM] Bittersweet#9376
You can expect 100% salary increase in 10-15 years

[22-May-19 06:36 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Not much but more than the 0 he gets

[22-May-19 06:37 AM] Bittersweet#9376
That's true everywhere in Belgium when you play your cards half right...

[22-May-19 06:38 AM] Malti#3948
but again, you have to be able to do your job for 10-15 years, for a 'measly' double in wage

[22-May-19 06:39 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Sure just saying 0 isn't exactly a good goal either

[22-May-19 06:39 AM] Malti#3948
and with 'being able to', i mean trying not to go mad

[22-May-19 06:39 AM] Malti#3948
office politics, annoying colleagues, shitty bosses...

[22-May-19 06:40 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Also Belgian SS allows you to quit your job and keep an income while starting your own business/activity

[22-May-19 06:40 AM] Malti#3948
the amount of times I fantasized of just standing up and walking out of there, you can't imagine

[22-May-19 06:40 AM] Malti#3948
@Bittersweet I don't know about that? you gotta be fired to get on benefits

[22-May-19 06:41 AM] Malti#3948
if you quit yourself there is a 6 month waiting period before you can get beneftis

[22-May-19 06:43 AM] Bittersweet#9376
I've once arranged with my employer to be released and that's how I started my company in BE

[22-May-19 06:43 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Not entirely sure of how common it is

[22-May-19 06:43 AM] Malti#3948
Thatâ€™s a good employer

[22-May-19 06:44 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Now I work in LU and manage said company

[22-May-19 06:44 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Without it I wouldn't have been able to

[22-May-19 06:44 AM] Malti#3948
What are your activities if I may ask?

[22-May-19 06:44 AM] Bittersweet#9376
It and insurance

[22-May-19 06:45 AM] Bittersweet#9376
My point is that it's not that balcj and white especially in BE where there is so much "interpretation" of the system

[22-May-19 06:45 AM] Bittersweet#9376
I'm not paying taxes for ahmed and a nigga

[22-May-19 06:45 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Like Tek said so elegantly

[22-May-19 06:47 AM] Bittersweet#9376
That's another debate altogether, say what you want but immigration is the only short term median population age controller

[22-May-19 06:47 AM] Bittersweet#9376
So I don't worry about that

[22-May-19 06:47 AM] Bittersweet#9376
When I compare Sweden/Germany with Japan

[22-May-19 06:48 AM] Bittersweet#9376

@Bittersweet dont forget the subsidies and tax cuts for every single thing in Belgium

[22-May-19 06:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if you are good you can game the system and take advantage of most of them

[22-May-19 06:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
while a lot of people/companies dont put in the time and effort and just pay the full amount of taxes

[22-May-19 06:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so the benefits go to the lucky few

[22-May-19 06:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
better off just making the system easier, cutting out all the exeptions and lowering taxes for everyone

[22-May-19 06:55 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Yes that one I'm on the fence over ðŸ˜…

[22-May-19 06:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
might cut down on administration while you are at it

[22-May-19 06:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
no more exeptions, no people that have to make sure it's done 'right'

[22-May-19 06:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
At this rate I'm pretty sure the country will be bankrupt in 10 years anyway so whatever

[22-May-19 06:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also pretty sure my generation will not get any type of pension whatever, so better make sure I accumulate enough to take care of myself when the time comes

[22-May-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
all the fiat countries are inflating at roughly the same rate and fiddling inflation numbers to pretend they arent

[22-May-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so the standard of living goes down across the board, slowly

[22-May-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
boiling the frog

[22-May-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
few notice

[22-May-19 06:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
not just inflation, national debt in belgium is already at 104% of the national product, and increasing 2% each year...

[22-May-19 06:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean wtf

[22-May-19 06:58 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Safe to say we will work until 75 at least

[22-May-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
they copy the USSA. just print more money

[22-May-19 06:58 AM] Bittersweet#9376
So they better cure aging

[22-May-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
dont forget to fiddle the inflation numbers so people dont panic

[22-May-19 06:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Any company that has 220billion in income every year (like Belgium has) and where they cant even make a profit, would fire the entire management and board of directors

[22-May-19 06:58 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Yes @jl777c no question about that

[22-May-19 06:58 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Still gotta live in this system somewhat though

[22-May-19 06:59 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Not going to be a leech because shit will hit the fan

[22-May-19 06:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If Tek's hero Kristof Calvo becomes prime minister I'm selling my company and moving to komodo island tbh
