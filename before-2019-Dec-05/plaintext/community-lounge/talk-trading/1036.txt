guys Im sorry to break the trend

[07-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but I just bought more KMD üòÆ

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Buddz1993#5380
:KMD: üçÄ

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
@Buddz1993 thank you sir

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Its ok

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Buddz1993#5380
well it was only 500

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
I will buy more when we go under 60 cents

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
and probably more when we get to 1k sats

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so can't push the price much higher.

[07-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
just for the memes

[07-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Flint#6435
and you admit the idea that we will fall by another 40-50% and then the recovery may take several years while Bitcoin will continue to grow to 50K, who will invest in a risky asset then? 2017 drove everyone crazy with the boom of ICO, but those days are over and this will never happen again!...

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] debaas#3337
thank you for your sacrifice

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] debaas#3337

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
maybe this is the reason kmd is not pushing marketing?

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
cause if we pump now

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
it will just dump again

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
but if u wait for market change when alts start to recover

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
it might be different

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] debaas#3337
they are not pushing with marketing because they first need businesses to use antara

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] debaas#3337
when they got people using their software. then they can monitize

[07-Aug-19 02:44 PM] debaas#3337
simple

[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
they ar enot pushing marketing cos they are bunch of nerds that dont know how to properly push marketing

[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] debaas#3337
doesnt happen this month, or this year maybe

[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Markus#5464
Yes also but market situation is not for alts either way, we can pump to 15k easily but we will fall below 10k in this market situation again

[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] debaas#3337
they are building a product, not a tool for you to get rich. remember that

[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
they will love to have kmd at more $$

[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
to pay devs and all

[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] Caglio#3337
noone wants coin not to be worth a dime, whata stupid statement that was

[07-Aug-19 02:46 PM] debaas#3337
they can pay devs, that's a drop in the bucket

[07-Aug-19 02:46 PM] debaas#3337
no worries there

[07-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Caglio#3337
they can for now

[07-Aug-19 02:47 PM] debaas#3337
even at 50 cents they can

[07-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Markus#5464
idc what the team does but i can tell u that @jl777c alone can get kmd to top 20 easily, just look at those innovations he make from ideas to reality sometimes in matter of a few hours

[07-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Flint#6435
better ask yourself who will invest a billion dollars in KOMODO if total regulation and delisting begins? Bitcoin may not be affected, but altcoins will face regulatory death! they can pull the most advanced and technological projects like KOMODO

[07-Aug-19 02:48 PM] coingirl87#6489
idc what the team does but i can tell u that @jl777c alone can get kmd to top 20 easily, just look at those innovations he make from ideas to reality sometimes in matter of a few hours  ....lol...how that?

[07-Aug-19 02:48 PM] Markus#5464
why do u need exchanges if u got a dex where devs can build on it and it will generate multiple dex's with same liquidity pool?

[07-Aug-19 02:48 PM] Markus#5464
its even better then current exchanges, u can have 100 exchanges and all share same orderbooks

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Markus#5464
thats insane

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] debaas#3337
komodo can be traded by US residents

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] debaas#3337
it will not get delisted

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
guys this is just speculations

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Flint#6435
enough collusion between bankers and the European Union, the US and China will regulate the industry to death and ban businesses from using cryptocurrencies under the threat of court and fines!

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
for KMD to"die" , it would need much more than what you are saying.

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and it won't be likely to happen.

[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I see blood in the streets

[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Markus#5464
@coingirl87 this is all planned for years

[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
everyone is getting rekt

[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
what a great time to buy just be glad I did

[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] coingirl87#6489
@Markus  komodo in top 20 or what you mean?

[07-Aug-19 02:51 PM] coingirl87#6489
I know that jl777 is very optimistic but i dont know why

[07-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Markus#5464
@coingirl87 KMD was a privacy coin, the team decided to remove privacy feature before it reaches larger adoption and get issues cause of its privacy feature by regulators

[07-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Markus#5464
thats thinking multiple steps ahead

[07-Aug-19 02:52 PM] coingirl87#6489
At current situation it looks very bad...no demand, no volume so i dont know what jl777 sees

[07-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Markus#5464
kmd is not alone

[07-Aug-19 02:52 PM] dan.#2473
are there any kmd moderates in here. such a vast amount of polarization

[07-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Markus#5464
so no worries

[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] debaas#3337
dgb even trading at 82 sats üòÉ

[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] debaas#3337
everyone loves dgb

[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Flint#6435
for komodo to be in the top 20 you need real DOLLARS of infusion into the project! and not bitcoin transfusion - no one will sell bitcoin for the sake of komodo if bitcoin continues to grow! all these capitalization figures - speculation and fake! you need to look at trading volumes with the dollar - where exactly are the dollars entering the market!

[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] debaas#3337
ehmm flint.. no

[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Markus#5464
u have stable coins on dex

[07-Aug-19 02:54 PM] debaas#3337
all crypto is used for trading, nothing else at the moment. so if traders think they can make more money with komodo than with bitcoin, they will shift

[07-Aug-19 02:54 PM] debaas#3337
this is how it has been for the past 10 years

[07-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Flint#6435
there are no volumes - the coin is not interesting to anyone now - nobody buys off when a new minimum is reached! (this is a bad sign

[07-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Markus#5464
this is what we have discussed past hour

[07-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Markus#5464
and its not kmd only

[07-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Markus#5464
u all just focus on kmd

[07-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Markus#5464
when its all alts

[07-Aug-19 02:56 PM] coingirl87#6489
No

[07-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380
most atls are bleeding , kmd is just bleeding more

[07-Aug-19 02:56 PM] coingirl87#6489
Thats not true

[07-Aug-19 02:56 PM] coingirl87#6489
Tezos,  lisk for example

[07-Aug-19 02:57 PM] coingirl87#6489
Also alts

[07-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Flint#6435
Komodo has good prospects in the next 5 years - no doubt! but now the dominance of bitcoin is growing and no one knows where it will stop!

[07-Aug-19 02:57 PM] coingirl87#6489
But there is demand

[07-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Markus#5464
ok so 2 out of 30 coins doing well

[07-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Markus#5464
good for them

[07-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Markus#5464
looks like similar path?

[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no only kmd is shit

[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you hear coingirl

[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
heard

[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
everything else is doing so much better

[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] CoinKing88#1540
girl get back in the kitchen please

[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes similiar but for me as investors its important if -30% or -60%

[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
:troll_king:

[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] jspook16#3059
Lol dude

[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Markus#5464
so if we compare kmd to eth

[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Markus#5464
if eth goes to 1000$

[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Markus#5464
who gains the most?

[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Markus#5464
higher cap or lower cap?

[07-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Markus#5464
im pretty sure kmd would gain more

[07-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Markus#5464
cause market cap is lower

[07-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Flint#6435
finally we are starting to see the true value of altcoins and this is just the beginning! who feels more stable during fluctuations - that inspires investors with even more hope! look at the XRP - everyone hates them for centralization - but they are doing better than most - not counting the pumps - they keep the levels well!

[07-Aug-19 03:02 PM] Flint#6435
although komodo is superior to many of the top 10 projects!!!

[07-Aug-19 03:02 PM] debaas#3337
xrp is at 2017 levels sat wise dude

[07-Aug-19 03:02 PM] debaas#3337
it's not doing well

[07-Aug-19 03:02 PM] debaas#3337
just like 99% of the coins
