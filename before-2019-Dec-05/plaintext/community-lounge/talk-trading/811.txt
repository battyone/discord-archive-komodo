consoloidation time now I think

[22-Jun-19 08:01 AM] Malti#3948
Pirate doing great actually in this btc rampage

[22-Jun-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i think it needs to test 10k to see if it really became support (used to be "resistance" for a day)

[22-Jun-19 08:01 AM] Malti#3948
And indeed @Cryptoon that documentation page is gold and got me even more bullish towards kmd

[22-Jun-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt even cover all the current things in development

[22-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Keppie#5156
link?

[22-Jun-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
also i came up with two significant enhancements for atomicDEX, not that it needs any to be top in the industry

[22-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Malti#3948
The developers I work with were also impressed

[22-Jun-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i see people complaining about marketing... their job is to understand: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/src/cc

[22-Jun-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and convert to "human" readable marketing materials

[22-Jun-19 08:04 AM] Malti#3948
Corporate blockchain devs that are saying good things about a blockchain that isn‚Äôt hyperledger or ethereum is already a win

[22-Jun-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if you think you can do better than our marketing has done, please step up and contribute

[22-Jun-19 08:04 AM] Tek#5253
i'll have a look jl

[22-Jun-19 08:04 AM] Tek#5253
im good at converting to normie speak

[22-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Tek#5253
doesnt seem to be the right link

[22-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Malti#3948
I‚Äôm super stoked for the evolve campaign anyways. The landing page was great already

[22-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Tek#5253
@jl777c I actually have one smart marketing idea for kmd

[22-Jun-19 08:06 AM] Tek#5253
its quite simple too, register KMD on memo.cash ( new cool social network on BCH ) . post about it sometimes.

[22-Jun-19 08:06 AM] Tek#5253
do you want me to do this?

[22-Jun-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
please understand that marketing is not about the price on binance

[22-Jun-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but with good marketing, the price on binance will be a lot better

[22-Jun-19 08:06 AM] Malti#3948
So true @jl777c

[22-Jun-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and i really like what the marketing team has done so far

[22-Jun-19 08:07 AM] Tek#5253
I followKMD on many places. it can step up easy

[22-Jun-19 08:07 AM] Malti#3948
Marketing isnt a one on one relation with trading price

[22-Jun-19 08:07 AM] Tek#5253
needs some more reach

[22-Jun-19 08:07 AM] Tek#5253
maybe i should join the marketing team ü§î

[22-Jun-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it takes a long time, but that is due to the sheer massive amount of tech, the non developers have to digest, conceptualize, translate and convert to marketing materials

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Malti#3948
Marketing will be focused on adoption of the platform instead of convincing traders to buy kmd, right?

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody stops people from adding KMD to memo.cash, or other places

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Malti#3948
Which is what it should üî•

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i tell marketing to get adoption with devs

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Tek  we have a community marketing section #talk-marketing

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
pumping the price is not on the radar

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Malti#3948
Nice

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
neither really are traders, sorry

[22-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Malti#3948
That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be

[22-Jun-19 08:09 AM] Malti#3948
It‚Äôs a tech project

[22-Jun-19 08:09 AM] altcoinist#1501
Good time to buy kmd?
I sold my btc at 8k for stablecoin but btc went up and I  lost lots of btcüòî

[22-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Malti#3948
Do you like the vision of Komodo?

[22-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Tek#5253
@altcoinist never sell during the bullrun

only buy buy buy

[22-Jun-19 08:10 AM] altcoinist#1501
Yes

[22-Jun-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if you feel BTC dominance is near its peak, then moving into non-BTC seems a decent idea

[22-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Tek#5253
bull run = buy buy buy

[22-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Malti#3948
And if you tend to like KMD, then that is the way to go

[22-Jun-19 08:11 AM] Malti#3948
If you are now into a stable coin, you have to ask yourself ‚Äúwill kmd become cheaper fiat wise?‚Äù

[22-Jun-19 08:12 AM] Tek#5253
only alt that manages to keep up with bitcoin a little is ETH

[22-Jun-19 08:12 AM] Tek#5253
price wise

[22-Jun-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
DENT!

[22-Jun-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810

Bnb year to date from 6 to 36

[22-Jun-19 08:21 AM] Tek#5253
should have seen the bnb moon coming really.

[22-Jun-19 08:21 AM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd from 0,8 to 1,38

[22-Jun-19 08:21 AM] Tek#5253
it was obvious

[22-Jun-19 08:21 AM] Tek#5253
binance was industry leader exchange

[22-Jun-19 08:21 AM] Tek#5253
ofc he would pump his cone

[22-Jun-19 08:21 AM] Tek#5253
and keep everyone who ever bought BNB happy

[22-Jun-19 08:21 AM] coingirl87#6489
2 years ago binance was nothing

[22-Jun-19 08:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
It was clever and aggressive marketing from the beginning until now

[22-Jun-19 08:22 AM] Tek#5253
yeah

[22-Jun-19 08:23 AM] coingirl87#6489
But kmd is no shitcoin...so what is possibke for kmd with clever and aggresive Marketing??

[22-Jun-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if we had a charismatic spokesperson, that would help in this regard

[22-Jun-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
what you are talking about is more promotion, than marketing

[22-Jun-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
more on the sales side of things, but we dont actually sell much to end users...

[22-Jun-19 08:26 AM] coingirl87#6489
Then we have to buy some one

[22-Jun-19 08:29 AM] coingirl87#6489
We need partnership with big companys...the oartnership with france bank was also a big marketing desaster

[22-Jun-19 08:29 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes but in future kmd will be a big ecosystem...tell the people, tell the world

[22-Jun-19 08:29 AM] Malti#3948
Which French bank?

[22-Jun-19 08:29 AM] coingirl87#6489
Monaze

[22-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Malti#3948
@coingirl87 did you read any of the evolve campaign?

[22-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Malti#3948
Have you seen the ecosystem grow?

[22-Jun-19 08:30 AM] coingirl87#6489
There was plenty of big announces

[22-Jun-19 08:30 AM] coingirl87#6489
After that many of delays

[22-Jun-19 08:30 AM] coingirl87#6489
And then...nothing

[22-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Malti#3948
Which wasn‚Äôt kmd to blame

[22-Jun-19 08:31 AM] Malti#3948
Kmd is a toolbox that monaize wanted to use

[22-Jun-19 08:31 AM] Malti#3948
It‚Äôs like a corporate should _announce_ that they will be using Linux

[22-Jun-19 08:32 AM] Malti#3948
But then their corporate bullshit firewall decides that windows is the only compliant OS
