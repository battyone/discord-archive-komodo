[20-Nov-18 08:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
my guess: everyone's figured out what happened with the mega artificial Tether pump last year, so it's going to return to the same price before

[20-Nov-18 08:27 PM] BlockTech#6895
That's one of the reason, but there is probably a lot more. (hash war, dump puppet, institutional getting in low, media and so on ...) probably to get the price down, accumulate and wait for the next bubble.

[20-Nov-18 08:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Bitcoin on Coinbase is $4,150, reached $4,050 today.

In Japan and South Korea, Bitcoin is averaging $4,400. Even on Gemini, Bitcoin is $4,276. 

BTC is selling at a 5~10 percent cheaper rate on Coinbase

[20-Nov-18 08:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'll tell you one thing, if it's not going to $700, they're going to take it to da moon quick
still too high for it to drag once they start covering shorts

[20-Nov-18 08:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
many people can't/won't use anything but Coinbase, and they are all panic selling, it seems

[20-Nov-18 08:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
Coinbase and BCH are bad news

[20-Nov-18 08:59 PM] ryman112#0068
If it is manipulation pushing it down...at what point is it more profitable to let it pump back up?  Or is this just bots going apeshit?

[20-Nov-18 09:01 PM] snowdamn#2414
Bids need to dry up a little bit 
once they see no more shorts can be entered easily they'll start covering

[20-Nov-18 09:02 PM] snowdamn#2414
