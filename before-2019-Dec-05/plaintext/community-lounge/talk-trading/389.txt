if it doesn't then I'm done with the whole space because that would mean that the space would be the one space in the tech sector that places 0 value on tech

Has Komodo reached out to Beaxy Exchange to try and get listed?

[29-Jan-19 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Is there a particular reason you keep shilling that 2 month old CEX?

[29-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Alecandro#1179
just another place to trade KMD?

[29-Jan-19 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and you've done adequate due diligence (which you can provide) to know that "we" (the community) should trust it?

[29-Jan-19 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_takes the silence as a "no"_

[29-Jan-19 05:16 PM] Alecandro#1179
I've researched it a little bit, but hey its up to the team I guess. Just gives Komodo more visibility and liquidity

[29-Jan-19 05:17 PM] Alecandro#1179
I'll even delete the referral link if it makes you feel better lol

[29-Jan-19 05:17 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think i saw someone had filled it already Alec

[29-Jan-19 05:17 PM] Alecandro#1179
okay cool, thanks

[29-Jan-19 05:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
A free listing is a free listing we should take it if we can imo , Users can then decide to trade there or not on their own due diligence

[29-Jan-19 05:19 PM] Alecandro#1179
exactly

[29-Jan-19 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'll even delete the referral link if it makes you feel better lol`
It would make me "feel better" if people didn't shill things (especially CEXs) without extreme due diligence

[29-Jan-19 05:20 PM] Alecandro#1179
Fair point- noted

[29-Jan-19 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[30-Jan-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah hes always saying same shit... I have his newsletter subscription... they have been sending itto me for free for nearly 2 years now... Definatly a fuck up on thier end... But I'll take it... made me a fair bit of money, decent tips generally.

[30-Jan-19 09:13 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Nice one, I have never signed up to that. He is good for new ppl hearing about crypto and anarchy etc . I liked his blogs better tbh in mexico life style walking his dogs etc haha

True ive never met the guy but he just comes across as honest maybe

[30-Jan-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hes been close to on point in the paid newlsetter, but not always what he says publicly is 100% the same.....

[30-Jan-19 09:16 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So you follow his stock calls then ?

[30-Jan-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope... Im just on general.. Like I said somhow im getting it for nothing ... so may as well. His stocks seem to have done pretty bad this year, the worst one was one he gave out publicly as "my best stock pick for the year"

[30-Jan-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that one fell the most 😂
