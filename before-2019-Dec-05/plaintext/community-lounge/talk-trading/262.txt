so it might be longer or shorter or conditional , who knows

Sorry, still confused here about who won the contest.  Decker technically won, right?  But who got there second and actually got the prize?

[04-Nov-18 11:50 AM] Lumbi#8378
Decker has learned gentlemanly habits in the tundras of siberia? 😉

0.99 ? it shows 0.95 - 0.96 on  cmc though

I'm long on kmd until it hit around $10 again 😬

[04-Nov-18 08:01 PM] jorian#4555
so you'll short when its 10?

[04-Nov-18 08:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that depends on a lot of factors, but I usually sell at most 50% of my holdings to take the profit

[04-Nov-18 08:34 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ofc in the long run, my goal is to accumulate as many kmd as possible

If we pump to 80k in 3 days like last time, i’ll sell a part, if we rise to 100k over the course of 6 months, i keep accumulating and prolly wont sell

[05-Nov-18 10:01 AM] JvdP#8992
I learned from the last bubble that I should formulate a sell/exit strategy and stick to it. Current version has me sell 10% at $10. I should probably make one that correlates to BTC value too, just in case...

[05-Nov-18 10:15 AM] jorian#4555

‘Ugh 120 confirmations, whatever I’ll just hodl’

[05-Nov-18 11:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or use an exchange that doesn't require 120 confs....

[05-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitpanda doesnt require that many confs but the rate they pay is lower than binance/bittrex

[05-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Dex doesnt allow to trade for euros

[05-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Etc

[05-Nov-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because you're selling enough that $0.0009 per matters?

[05-Nov-18 11:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitpanda is +-5% difference

Trex decreased to 30 confs?

That’s not too bad I guess

[05-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Thought it was still 120 my bad 😦

[05-Nov-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it was for like 4 days after the whole everyone went nuts over the 51% thing

[05-Nov-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then richie listened to reason and set 30

[05-Nov-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Bitpanda is +-5% difference`
Yeah, I misread what you wrote before that, I thought you were saying the price difference between binance and trex

[05-Nov-18 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_needs sleep, it's almost 6am_

[05-Nov-18 11:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yea np, the arbi bots between trex and binance do their job well

[05-Nov-18 11:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitpanda is like coinbase in that regard

[05-Nov-18 11:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Price they show on frontpage is different than the price they are using to buy

[05-Nov-18 11:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Tbh I think alts will move when btc does

[05-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And btc will move when some etf gets approved, untill then I expect price to remain in the 6200-6800 zone

For the belgians here... as long as profits are in a buy/hold atmosphere and you are not trading excessively ruling is that crypto profits are taxfree 😃

[05-Nov-18 04:05 PM] tolken#2655
@Cryptoon use BarterDex next time 😃

[05-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Barterdex doesnt trade euro’s though which is what was being discussed earlier

[05-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cfr cashing out a part of bag etc

[05-Nov-18 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or any fiat :p

[05-Nov-18 04:06 PM] tolken#2655
USDC, GUSD now supported on bdex

[05-Nov-18 04:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretend tokens aren't fiat

[05-Nov-18 04:07 PM] tolken#2655
Dump to that, then exit through any big exchange.

[05-Nov-18 04:07 PM] tolken#2655
they’re good enough vessels to hold for the 15min until you convert to pretend usd.

[05-Nov-18 04:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
take 147000 USDC to the local bank and see if they give you USD for it :trollface:

[05-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If I need the big exchange anyway, forgive me if I will pass on using tether and consorts

[05-Nov-18 04:08 PM] tolken#2655

[05-Nov-18 04:10 PM] tolken#2655
GUSD and USDC seem to have cut a clear distinction from USDT. I agree I wouldn’t hold it there, but I’m not sure what the phobia is to use it very briefly to get KMD from your wallet onto Coinbase, then cash out.

[05-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why not just go kmd>btc on dex

[05-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And btc> usd on coinbase then?

[05-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No need for usdx

[05-Nov-18 04:12 PM] tolken#2655
thought you wanted to sell out of crypto though, but yea fair enough.

[05-Nov-18 04:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no matter how many of what letter they put before or after USD, it still isn't directly redeemable for USD except in select locations (which means it's utter useless 💩 )

[05-Nov-18 04:14 PM] tolken#2655
well, as long as it’s controlled by a central entity, yeah they could exert some undesirable control over it.

[05-Nov-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`backed by actual USD` (because some guy you never heard of swears it's in a bank he will not tell you about)

[05-Nov-18 04:16 PM] tolken#2655
I guess the case I see for USDC and GUSD is that it allows for getting out of crypto positions without any exposure to KYC.

[05-Nov-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
gl with that lasting longer than a couple months, and if it stays KYC-free, it's of no real USD value and you might as well stay with your real coin of choice

[05-Nov-18 04:20 PM] tolken#2655
well look at the BTC bear market for example. Some anon that had a large position in KMD that wanted to short both KMD and BTC, would shift their positions into a pegged fiat, then when the time is right, but back into BTC/KMD or whatever. Seems preferable (uncertainty of reliability or pegged fiat aside)  to using a CEX to sell to fiat.

[05-Nov-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm far too lazy to explain to you how nothing can be USD-pegged **and** exempt from KYC/AML because **all** Federal Reserve Notes are property of the Federal Reserve and no human on the planet actually owns any USD....

[05-Nov-18 04:45 PM] tolken#2655
yes that’s what the law wants but in practice there are no enforceable ways that I’m aware of that the current crop of fiat pegged coins can demand KYC once they’re out in the wild. At point-if-sale from CEX’s certainly. If for example Jl777 buys GUSD from BarterDex using jumblered KMD, then later sells GUSD for KMD, seems like he successfully avoided his chickens from being known.  Not that he would necessarily do that, but just saying. The exchanges would have to restrict the flow of new USDC/GUSD from entering/exiting the market, which isn’t out of the question, and probably likely at some point as regulators tighten their grip.
