I'm interested by the "crypto accountants in france"... Don't know where to start my searches. It seems that "fiscal services" don't know how to tax us too!

[14-Jun-19 09:14 PM] metaphilibert#0926
France seems to be hell for crypto startups as all the main banks are not allowing you to open accounts if you mention "blockchain" or "Cryptocurrency" in your business description
True fact

[14-Jun-19 09:14 PM] phm87#7395
establish crypto company in france with bank account is germany is fine

[14-Jun-19 09:14 PM] phm87#7395
I heard

[14-Jun-19 09:17 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Was highlightening the fact that the situation in France is quite noticeable as banks are really blocking the thing
Like a non said protectionnism
And in the meanwhile minister of economy is using the word crypto-nation

[14-Jun-19 09:18 PM] metaphilibert#0926
So lol

[14-Jun-19 09:18 PM] metaphilibert#0926
And so sad

[14-Jun-19 09:18 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[14-Jun-19 09:19 PM] phm87#7395
But I still want to know how it is taxed in france and how we can fuck states

[14-Jun-19 09:19 PM] phm87#7395
or nuke govts if you prefer

[14-Jun-19 09:20 PM] metaphilibert#0926
In west EU, Crypto friendly countries are
Netherlands
Portugal
Luxembourg
Switzerland (not really in eu)

[14-Jun-19 09:21 PM] phm87#7395
Luxembourg is a good country very close to Be. Portugal is far and country have more pbs than Lux

[14-Jun-19 09:22 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Netherlands are not far from you also and and many attractive aspects üòâ

[14-Jun-19 09:22 PM] phm87#7395
I'd love to go to the Netherlands but I must learn more the language that ik spreek een beetje

[14-Jun-19 09:23 PM] phm87#7395
yes but mining ... is it working or trading or else ?

[14-Jun-19 09:23 PM] phm87#7395
how to tax ?

[14-Jun-19 09:23 PM] phm87#7395
apart from that, if I launch a hashrate trading place such as nicehashmafia or hashtap.ca (zpool that I love), how to tax this ?

[14-Jun-19 09:24 PM] phm87#7395
Income is coming from all around the world so due to global income, the company can choose its country and states are trying to attract with rulings

[14-Jun-19 09:24 PM] phm87#7395
and exceptions in laws

[14-Jun-19 09:25 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Not sure about all the specific aspects but it surely should worh a comparison

[14-Jun-19 09:26 PM] phm87#7395
US defined laws about mining and I think that other countries should follow

[14-Jun-19 09:26 PM] phm87#7395
US have a bigger army and a president that is more intelligent than other presidents united :troll:

[14-Jun-19 09:27 PM] phm87#7395
but in many cases, US decided and other countries follows

[14-Jun-19 09:27 PM] phm87#7395
what about VAT on crypto on mining in US ?

[14-Jun-19 09:27 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Don't know

[14-Jun-19 09:27 PM] phm87#7395
answer can change in each state of US I think

[14-Jun-19 09:28 PM] phm87#7395
maybe we should ask @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  about US taxes on mining/trading and such things

[14-Jun-19 09:28 PM] metaphilibert#0926
```but in many cases, US decided and other countries follows```
Less since the orange agent

[14-Jun-19 09:29 PM] metaphilibert#0926
At least I hope üòÖ

[14-Jun-19 09:32 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Oh orange agent is a reference to the guy elected in US in case you wonder

[14-Jun-19 09:42 PM] metaphilibert#0926
not sure if i prefer a dumb guy or a smart guy acting like a dumb

Sorry to digress to politics and economics.
Let's go back to tax system comparison and tax load balancing

[14-Jun-19 09:45 PM] phm87#7395

[14-Jun-19 09:45 PM] phm87#7395

[14-Jun-19 09:50 PM] phm87#7395

@Cryptoon  you're right about (logical) non appliance of VAT for your "intracommunautaire" invoices  (between EU countries) (for B2B only) -check article 21 Code TVA / article 44 Directive 2006/112/CE-
but afaik VAT infos are crossed between EU countries and using a VAT nr to buy goods in another country with a 21% discount (by not registering on your side) will be spotted and is fraud

[14-Jun-19 10:30 PM] metaphilibert#0926
just saying

[14-Jun-19 10:30 PM] metaphilibert#0926

@lukechilds friend me.   i can't DM you. have questions about setting up company in thailand.

[15-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@metaphilibert intracommunautaire listing which they use to check such things is only needed if you cross 100k in international invoices a year I believe. Without there isnt an efficient way to check this

[15-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also in the company my partner has a family member working for the tax authority and just asked her if they checked for such things

[15-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
She said they dont have time for that so its simply not checked üòÉ

i thought multinationals never have to pay any taxes via cleverly setup inter-company expenses/revenues

[15-Jun-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
a) find 2 (or more) jurisdictions that allow for arbitrary fiscal years and taxes due based on annual profits

[15-Jun-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
b) company in jurisdiction A has fiscal year ending Dec 31, in B it ends June 30th

[15-Jun-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
c) during the first half of year, B has a lot of legitimate expenses that it pays to A, so A has a surplus at June 30th, B has no profits at the critical end of fiscal year

[15-Jun-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
d) during the second half of the year, A has a lot of legitimate expenses that it pays to B, so B now has a surplus at Dec 31 and A has no profits at the critical end of fiscal year

[15-Jun-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
e) repeat, moving ever larger amounts as profits compound taxfree

[15-Jun-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
when i realized this is what the multinationals are doing, with full awareness of the govt, then i realized it is only the smaller companies that are funding basically the majority of tax burden

[15-Jun-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
best is to pick A and B that have legitimate seasonal profitability, many retail companies have a lot of profits in Q4, so that is not to hard to find

[15-Jun-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and all this done properly is totally legal as they wrote the rules so that if you pay the accountant and laywer taxes, you dont have to pay actual taxes

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[15-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I do that with my comps as they have different ends of their fiscal years

[15-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô is when you want to take out profits is that you need to realize them one day in order to pay out dividends from your country

[15-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What the international companies do is setup a company that holds the trademarks in a low tax country

[15-Jun-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
with proper types of companies, virtually all things can become a company expense, cant it?

[15-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And the other entities in high tax countries pay to use the trademarks to the low tax entity

[15-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all just a big joke, the companies with the funds to pay the right accountants end up with 2.4% tax rate, the others at 48%

{Reactions}
üíØ (3) ü§° üåé 

[15-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So they siphon profits to entities in low tax companies

[15-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Et voila, you can extract dividends very cheaply

[15-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so pay the 2% tax, all problems solved

[15-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the tax rate for a properly structured multinational is whatever the lowest tax rate that exists in the world

[15-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
toss in all the special exemptions that exist

[15-Jun-19 09:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Jep

[15-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just a big waste of time and productivity to prevent excessive taxation. more efficient to spend time and money on productive things, but it you dont do it, you get screwed really bad, so seems not much choice but to play the game

[15-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem is that you have countries also outbidding eachother fiscally in order to have the multinationals come to their country

üëÜ 

[15-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So the companies with most resources have the best opportunities to figure it all out

[15-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And small/medium enterprises end up paying the bills

[15-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Although apparently in BE anyone can go to the taxman and ask for a fiscal ruling üòÉ

[15-Jun-19 10:42 AM] phm87#7395
Most of the bel20 companies have a fiscal ruling (some are below 500 employees). I will begin an excel sheet.
I agree with Cryptoon : we should ask a ruling. But for now, I prefer to learn existing rules about other countries

[15-Jun-19 10:44 AM] phm87#7395
I saw small companies with as much optimizations as big ones (they played with their friends companies instead of creating new ones). Who owns the company, who is employee and have right to unemployment benefits as example

[15-Jun-19 10:45 AM] phm87#7395
And to reduce taxes, I wonder if I can play with notional interests to invest in buildings and projects in Europe (such as @Lumbi idea about a farm in Europe). I am just thinking here

[15-Jun-19 11:41 AM] mrlynch#5735
just want to mention my recent experiences
UK is a crypto friendly country - i was looking for months for a proper setup and didn't see the trees for the forest

1. main banks are crypto friendly (barclays actually welcome crypto businesses as they are building their own blockchain)
2. company formation is cheap (aprox ¬£150 with all the bells and whistles; cheapest i saw was around ¬£40) and you don't have to be a resident
3. gov has passed **some** crypto tax regulation but they left it at a case by case basis basically meaning don't be a dickhead and pay **some** tax - hmrc (irs equivalent) is more than helpful with info - long term hodlers pay 0% tax, traders need to qualify under what they call "badges of trade" and pay cgt (capital gains tax - 20% of profits), trust funds are possible to alleviate %
4. corporation tax is 19% but there are loads of deductibles
5. london is one of the most respected financial centers
6. if brexit happens, regulations are more likely to be even more relaxed - brits in general like privacy, but had to go by eu laws & regulations (aml, etc)
7. plenty of crypto accountants & lawyers offering their services which lets u focus on actually running your business and they deal with all the tax non-sense

all in all not a bad deal

[15-Jun-19 11:47 AM] mrlynch#5735
you don't have to report profits under that threshold unless u sell crypto worth 4 times that

@phm87 btw I would never ask for a ruling directly myself, but let a lawyer be an intermediary at first to see what is possible. Otherwise if the ruling is denied they know who you are and what you have. But if done by a lawyer on your behalf, the lawyer can ask it hypothetically and not divulge personal information because client confidentiality.

[15-Jun-19 01:51 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[15-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Asked my banker what their stance is on crypto, and they automatically flag your account when you deal with crypto exchanges etc, but dont do anything about it

[15-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They flag it just so they know you are in contact with crypto

[15-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And if you stay below 10k withdrawals they wont automatically report you to the govt

[15-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That was early 2018 tho, not sure what the stance is now, can ask again when I see him (KBC)

[15-Jun-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
My friend is using seeral bank accounts to stay below limits. He worked for a big bank so he knows rules.
One idea is to use the same bank of the exchange used (kraken used deutsche bank)
