If jl777 - is brain / heart, i guess ca333 - soul )

[07-Feb-19 10:55 PM] Decker#3767
Or soul is entire Komodo Team )

Even if we will know what we called "soul" ... i think solution is not just a combine wiith "Komodo is ahead of Decred".

[07-Feb-19 11:08 PM] Decker#3767
If so ... how to combine level1 with SuperNET? Any ideas?

[07-Feb-19 11:08 PM] Strob#3417
But it's not in the article...

[07-Feb-19 11:18 PM] Decker#3767
So ... "soul" should be mentioned in article?

[07-Feb-19 11:19 PM] cryptocat#9465
spirit is

What the komodo specific terms or names is mentioned? Komodo, BarterDEX ...

[07-Feb-19 11:20 PM] Strob#3417
He said: "all info needed is in the article - i estimate that a few hints will be necessary. However, it is not entirely impossible to solve it without clue from my end.
keep in mind what the first hint says."

[07-Feb-19 11:24 PM] cryptocat#9465
Any reason why he wrote #KMD and not Komodo? Just for the twitter hashtag plug?

[07-Feb-19 11:26 PM] Decker#3767
And "level I" and "level II" instead of "level 1" and "level 2" )

[07-Feb-19 11:27 PM] cryptocat#9465
Level aye and level aye aye, captain

[07-Feb-19 11:48 PM] ch6ris#5240
I was so sure it would be "Komodo is ahead of Decred Begin Your Journey With Komodo"

[07-Feb-19 11:52 PM] ch6ris#5240
Maybe something to do with BitcoinDark?

Other crazy idea ... "Komodo is ahead of Decred" = 25 symbols / bytes  ... so, to have 32 bytes privkey - 7 symbols / bytes needed.

[08-Feb-19 12:08 AM] Decker#3767
What can be a "soul" in 7 bytes?

[08-Feb-19 12:09 AM] Decker#3767
1. komodod 
2. <other suggestions?>

[08-Feb-19 12:12 AM] Decker#3767
May be it's also wrong way, but who knows.

I found something interesting this morning...thinking about the creators of each project

[08-Feb-19 07:56 AM] cryptocat#9465
Twitter usernames:
Komodo = James Lee = @jl777 
Decred = Jake Yocom-Piatt = @behindtext

[08-Feb-19 07:57 AM] cryptocat#9465
Just thinking of "ahead" and "behind", maybe some correlation.

[08-Feb-19 07:58 AM] cryptocat#9465
I've tried - jl777 is ahead of behindtext
and other variations, but nothing

[08-Feb-19 08:00 AM] cryptocat#9465
I've tried their real names too - James Lee is ahead of Jake Yocom-Piatt

[08-Feb-19 08:46 AM] ch6ris#5240
Not really the soul of komodo though.

[08-Feb-19 09:23 AM] ch6ris#5240
The soul of Komodo is ahead of Decred

[08-Feb-19 09:42 AM] cryptocat#9465
Is it the centre of the logo? The octogon?

[08-Feb-19 10:29 AM] cryptocat#9465
Text to roman numeral conversion?

[08-Feb-19 12:16 PM] cryptocat#9465
So many possibilities! Are we over-thinking it @ca333?

[08-Feb-19 12:34 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
The soul is in the article too?

[08-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Strob#3417
@cryptocat The center of the logo I thought about that too. And I played a lot with ca333 = Kadan Stadelmann (realizing that he is the one interviewed in the article! I would be surprised if he called himself "the soul of Komdo" though... I read many interviews and article learning more about Komodo in the process and found absolutel6y no mention of the word "soul" anywhere.

[08-Feb-19 01:04 PM] Strob#3417
@mazyar_lp Now I am starting to doubt that level 2 is in the article. ca333 said all the info is in the article, but it could be that the info was only level 1 and level 2 must be extrapolated from level 1 in some way.

[08-Feb-19 01:04 PM] cryptocat#9465
There is the mention of "spirit" in the article though

[08-Feb-19 01:05 PM] Strob#3417
Yes but in relation to Decred, so I doubt it's related...

[08-Feb-19 01:06 PM] cryptocat#9465
But the last clue says level I and level II

[08-Feb-19 01:06 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Mybe Soul is in the article and i think should mix with level 1

[08-Feb-19 01:06 PM] cryptocat#9465
Maybe he's just trying to throw us off

Hello, any unsolved puzzle here ?

[08-Feb-19 01:10 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
The soul is someone or something

[08-Feb-19 01:14 PM] Strob#3417
Soul in german can be the same thing as heart (Herz) ca333 speak german I think. So could it be just jl777 again? But how to combine it to get to level 2 I tried everything I could think with it.

[08-Feb-19 01:17 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I dont think jl777 be the all three (heart..)

[08-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Strob#3417
The soul could be related to the Komodo dragon. Fire is the soul of the dragon maybe?

[08-Feb-19 01:21 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
No i think ca33 want to send a  message that promotes komodo

If we make a synthesis of everything we suggested it will be huge and could take months to try all the possibilities with all the possible words and possible process to combine or derive these words.

A soul's weight is 21g so maybe related to 21

[08-Feb-19 10:36 PM] Strob#3417
In 1901 Duncan MacDougall conducted an experiment in which he made weight measurements of patients as they died. He claimed that there was weight loss of varying amounts at the time of death; he concluded the soul weighed 21 grams.[
