Wait...where can you view thew WIF address in Agama? I'm using the Lite version.

[10-Feb-19 11:22 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
setting export

[10-Feb-19 11:22 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
i didnt know we can export it. i wanted to try it minutes before crack

[10-Feb-19 11:23 PM] cryptocat#9465
Well I never would have found that...

[10-Feb-19 11:24 PM] cryptocat#9465
Well done @LeFevre !👏

[10-Feb-19 11:25 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
yeah great job

[10-Feb-19 11:28 PM] mazyar_lp#3486

For all who forget how to export WIF from Agama.

[10-Feb-19 11:28 PM] cryptocat#9465
Ahh I see now

[10-Feb-19 11:28 PM] cryptocat#9465
I never knew about that feature

So, it was useful puzzle )

[10-Feb-19 11:29 PM] cryptocat#9465
haha very much so, learning soooo much

[10-Feb-19 11:29 PM] cryptocat#9465
but these puzzles are not for everyone

[10-Feb-19 11:29 PM] cryptocat#9465
only those who know the technology

And our aim is giving to all a chance to understanding / learning crypto basics.

[10-Feb-19 11:30 PM] Decker#3767
WIFs, privkeys, etc. - are basic things.

If somebody don't understand "what is privkey" or "what is WIF" - he can easily lose his funds. Isn't it?

[10-Feb-19 11:32 PM] cryptocat#9465
Yes, but that feature of WIF is hidden within settings. Even if it was visible within the Settings tab, but it's within Settings > Export Keys and then it doesn't show it until you enter the seed.

[10-Feb-19 11:32 PM] cryptocat#9465
All I'm saying is it's a little frustrating when UX interferes with puzzles like this.

[10-Feb-19 11:33 PM] cryptocat#9465
haha sorry it's just part of my job to see good UX

[10-Feb-19 11:34 PM] ch6ris#5240

i see this as pesudo puzzles . because puzzles should crack without not related  stuff

[10-Feb-19 11:35 PM] cryptocat#9465
Ok let's crack @Decker's puzzle while we wait for the 3 level one 😊

[10-Feb-19 11:36 PM] ch6ris#5240
Sorry it was "5HueCGU8rMjxEXxiPuD5BDku4MkFqeZyd4dZ1jvhTVqvbTLvyTJ"

we tried to create something that teaches the KMD technology. if we are very precise then you actually wouldnt really need Agama - you should have used it - yes, and we wish/want you to use it... because we want to educate you on everything blockchain related and also KMD related (KMD software, etc.) 
But what i am saying is - all it takes was some very basic crypto-knowledge. (privkey derivations from seed, sha256, etc.). And I ve posted the essential detail here: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/542089680544595998/544125519084650507

please check it out - if you still dont really know the background of the privkey derivation from the seed, etc. then read it up and plz ASK us. just post in here. there is nothing such as a stupid question. every serious question is justified.

[10-Feb-19 11:40 PM] ch6ris#5240
What's a battle?

[10-Feb-19 11:40 PM] ca333#0118
also expect future cryptopuzzle to build up on such knowledge that we have worked with in previous puzzles.

[10-Feb-19 11:41 PM] ca333#0118

[10-Feb-19 11:43 PM] ch6ris#5240
Good job everyone, thanks for the fun. If more people come to this space they will not have gained the knowledge from previous puzzles to complete/compete in any new puzzles. just thinking out loud

[10-Feb-19 11:44 PM] ch6ris#5240
Need some simple copy paste puzzles hidden deep within something

[10-Feb-19 11:44 PM] ca333#0118
good point @ch6ris - i will rush on the "cryptopuzzle" subpage on our website and summarize the knowledge we should have gained with the previous puzzles!

@ch6ris btw ... i don't know how deep you understand risk of exposing wif in public ... but never use it again ... bcz all now know all corresponding addresses in all networks - 1LoVGDgRs9hTfTNJNuXKSpywcbdvwRXpmK, 1GAehh7TsJAHuUAeKZcXf5CnwuGuGgyX2S, RV5gLjZiTyW2jTjVr5WSYMK9Ns6XcH2eyq, RQSqnCzkU7xryUXqnjbekbXziAjVv5UxWp ... it's all compromised now ... hope you well understand it.

[10-Feb-19 11:51 PM] ch6ris#5240
It was a joke. You probably shouldn't have asked me to post it in the first place 😂

[10-Feb-19 11:51 PM] ch6ris#5240
It's not real. Don't worry

[10-Feb-19 11:52 PM] Decker#3767
For all others - **main** rule - don't post anywhere your passphrases, WIFs and other private info.

[10-Feb-19 11:53 PM] ch6ris#5240
cap JL777 was the trick/trap

[10-Feb-19 11:53 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Maybe caps

[10-Feb-19 11:53 PM] Strob#3417
Bu tI tried so many variation so close to this I may have missed that exact one,

[10-Feb-19 11:54 PM] Strob#3417
I had to go for the day justbefore 2 last hints were given... too bad

[11-Feb-19 12:17 AM] cryptocat#9465
@Decker Does Agama allow for foreign characters in the seed? Like chinese symbols?

[11-Feb-19 12:18 AM] cryptocat#9465
Or can you hint if there are or not in the seed/WIF? My mind will now forever over-think puzzles like this 😂

[11-Feb-19 12:21 AM] Decker#3767
@cryptocat Yes, it allows. You can use any UTF-8 symbols in Agama, even like ฿ )

[11-Feb-19 06:06 AM] Gam_B1t#6991
I was still trying to script the process of wif derivation from passphrase in python lol. Far from the solution.

[11-Feb-19 08:05 AM] cryptocat#9465
@Decker can we get a Wen Moon clue?

[11-Feb-19 08:11 AM] cryptocat#9465
I hope it's not a 4 step solution
Text string > WIF > SHA256(WIF) > SHA256(WIF)+(random word) 😰

[11-Feb-19 08:38 AM] Decker#3767
@cryptocat to be honest - this puzzle is for kids, i think everybody can solve it without any clues. but, if no winners in next 5-6 hours - i will post a hint.

[11-Feb-19 08:39 AM] Decker#3767
And here is no any hashes or math.

[11-Feb-19 08:42 AM] Decker#3767

Wen Moon Puzzle

Wen Moon was a chinese McDonald's manager. After hard work week he got drunk ... ) 


And sent last 0.5 DEX from his wallet to this address https://dex.kmdexplorer.io/address/RKvq6XqCU7TwKjqkGYzbDL6cBgnhJQqo2u 
and forget about it. 

But in 2045, when 1 DEX = 500 BTC he remember about it and start trying to recover his funds ... 

The only one thing that he remember about "sent day" was that this is end of week and he was very drunk ))
Help Wen Moon became rich again )))

[11-Feb-19 09:31 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
:))

[11-Feb-19 10:12 AM] cryptocat#9465
I'm guessing it will be a simple text string, something like "Wen Moon very drunk Sunday" or some form of it, or could be in chinese translation.

[11-Feb-19 10:13 AM] mazyar_lp#3486

@mazyar_lp  Sorry I just saw your comment. I know I could have kept level 1 for me but I was thinking ca333 will give it anyway with more clue if i don't and if i give it will go faster to level 2. But then the hints came when i had to leave so I missed it.

yeay  team prize

[11-Feb-19 11:39 AM] Strob#3417
And I will give a very important trick for those puzzles: instead of using Agama I used the paper wallet Brain Wallet tab and Wallet details tab. with those it goes faster to try stuff instead of starting Agama at each try.

[11-Feb-19 11:40 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
tnx man

[11-Feb-19 11:40 AM] Strob#3417
Or you can use the cli with bat files I guess

[11-Feb-19 11:41 AM] Strob#3417

To test a passphrase, enter it in Brain Wallet with Iguana compatible ticked and if it's a wif enter it in Wallet Details. But Agama gives a different result if you paste a string on 2 lines.
