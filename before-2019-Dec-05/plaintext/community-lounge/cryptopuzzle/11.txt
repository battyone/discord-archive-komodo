and possibly just the "most important sentence" per header piece

[15-Feb-19 10:18 PM] LeFevre#5755
thats gonna be tricky

[15-Feb-19 10:57 PM] Strob#3417
step2 Byzantine????

[15-Feb-19 11:02 PM] Strob#3417
I wonder if the strong means it has to have the strong tag in html or can it also be everything that is in bold type?

[15-Feb-19 11:05 PM] LeFevre#5755
my first assumption was only the strong tag

[15-Feb-19 11:05 PM] LeFevre#5755
but I havent gotten anything to work

[15-Feb-19 11:05 PM] LeFevre#5755
so, not sure

[16-Feb-19 08:09 AM] cryptocat#9465
Where there is no strong, the value is empty/null/non-existent

Clue 5: Count the strong army that remains. Where there are no strong they simply don't exist.

Hopefully that should help you solve step 1

[16-Feb-19 09:19 AM] Decker#3767
I'm crying because puzzle is not solveable without hints. No one able to guess that he should:
1. Divide article into headers / pillars.
2. Find in each fragment from [1] <strong></strong>
3. Count "army" in each strong ) What is the army, number of capital letters or number of words with capital letters? 
It's crazy task )

[16-Feb-19 09:39 AM] Decker#3767
And, for example, this it's a header ... but it's strong too ))

[16-Feb-19 09:46 AM] Decker#3767
And this looks like "strong army", but may be it's weak ))) bcz it's using <b> instead of <strong> ))

The seed for step 1 is a series of numbers, separated by a space. x x xx xx x

[16-Feb-19 10:39 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Decker where is your puzzle that you promised ? These puzzles are so random

[16-Feb-19 10:41 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
Too much time need for spare and end of day you realize one hint is missing

[16-Feb-19 10:43 AM] cryptocat#9465
Seriously there is nothing missing. Just count the bold words between each heading. If there are none then move onto the next section...

[16-Feb-19 10:44 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
@cryptocat before this hint .i know now it is easy

[16-Feb-19 10:48 AM] cryptocat#9465
I'll be providing no more clues for step 2 and 3 for at least 1 full day, if it is not solved.

[16-Feb-19 10:52 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
@cryptocat no offense i am just frustrated üòÖ

[16-Feb-19 10:58 AM] Decker#3767
i'm always thinking that is 7 or 9 headers in article ... but last hint shown that headers number is 6 )

[16-Feb-19 10:58 AM] Decker#3767
btw ... somebody grabbed this RPnepqhNRQvvMR2P4BAVdG85d4g2uoXZQJ ...

[16-Feb-19 10:59 AM] Decker#3767
@mazyar_lp sorry, haven't time for this yet ... i think i will post it before Monday ...

[16-Feb-19 11:00 AM] cryptocat#9465
Ok someone solved step 1!

[16-Feb-19 11:03 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Decker i am waiting üôè

[16-Feb-19 11:10 AM] cryptocat#9465
Who got it? It has to be someone in here after my last clue...

[16-Feb-19 11:12 AM] cryptocat#9465
For step 2 consider "Byzantine". For step 3 make step 2 secure (you know what to do üòâ )

[16-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Decker#3767
@cryptocat 1st serie of numbers in `x x xx xx x` is a 8, right? these `game engine ported to blockchain in a week` 8 words. or 1 st serie is 0, bcz between header #1 and header #2 thes is 0 strong words?

[16-Feb-19 11:26 AM] Decker#3767
and 5 series of numbers total? i'm correctly understand last hint?

[16-Feb-19 11:26 AM] cryptocat#9465
strong/bold

[16-Feb-19 11:28 AM] cryptocat#9465
I stated before it includes everything in the article, from top to bottom.

[16-Feb-19 11:30 AM] cryptocat#9465
But yes, you are only missing the first number

[16-Feb-19 11:30 AM] cryptocat#9465
and it is not 8

[16-Feb-19 11:32 AM] Decker#3767
so, 0 and 8 ? or FEBRUARY 12, 2019  MYLO     BLOCKCHAIN, KOMODO is counted too?

[16-Feb-19 11:34 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
arent these extra hints @cryptocat ... this is not fair to answer @Decker  s questions

[16-Feb-19 11:34 AM] cryptocat#9465
Someone has already solved step 1...I want you to get along there too

[16-Feb-19 11:34 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
It was solved üòÄ the first one

[16-Feb-19 11:37 AM] Decker#3767
@linuxcaptain as he answers in public and as step1 is solved anyway - i think it's fair ...

[16-Feb-19 11:37 AM] Decker#3767
you can read answers too ...

[16-Feb-19 11:38 AM] cryptocat#9465
I think for next puzzle I will create only 1 step üòÇ

[16-Feb-19 11:39 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
its not fair for theperson who solved it without these @Decker

[16-Feb-19 11:40 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
Maybe You should just use the article text . Many possibilities in this way .tnx btw for the puzzle

[16-Feb-19 11:40 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
+ answering your questions helps your own logic and tactic... maybe i was stuck on something else and i already realized that "FEBRUARY 12, 2019  MYLO     BLOCKCHAIN, KOMODO is counted too? " counted too....

[16-Feb-19 11:42 AM] cryptocat#9465
Ok I think that is fair. Maybe we can agree on a certain set of rules from now on?

I think KMD members are great founders of this new #cryptopuzzle craze, so let's make sure it continues right.

[16-Feb-19 11:45 AM] Decker#3767
anyway, sorry for questions guys ... i thought if puzzle author counts that question is incompatible with "rules" or answering on it will not fair - he just wouldn't answer.

[16-Feb-19 11:46 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
because if it gets bigger

[16-Feb-19 11:46 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
these mistakes will harm the komdo community

[16-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Decker#3767
Congratz! Somebody solved step 3 )

[16-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Decker#3767
For step 2 it was `6 8 21 53 6` ...

[16-Feb-19 12:16 PM] cryptocat#9465
Nice! üëè

[16-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Decker#3767
And what was step 3? SHA256 + something ?

[16-Feb-19 12:19 PM] cryptocat#9465
If anyone wants to know I will DM you. I'll not post it here just yet

Looking at the winning address, the same person who solved mine is the same person who solved @sœÜldat's puzzle on 5th February

From Where comes 21??

[16-Feb-19 01:29 PM] Strob#3417
OH boy I could never guess we had to count the words... That was too hard in the way that there was too many possibilities It hink... Why the winner is hiding???? Can't wait to know what was the Byzantine about!

[16-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Strob#3417
Next puzzle will be to find who the winner is lol!

[16-Feb-19 01:33 PM] Strob#3417

[16-Feb-19 03:04 PM] Decker#3767
Ok, guys ... as our ghost solver solved it too fast - will be additional prize 11.1 KMD for first user who post here privkey from paperwallet and full steps he used to find a solution. Even if this person will be our ghost solver again, it will be good for all to know how to solve this. So, **Catz Puzzle** is still alive - https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/542089680544595998/546334352926179373 . I will not fund the address with 11.1 KMD to prevent transfer funds without posting a solution here.
