Hi cryptocal! I just grabbed some pop corn and read the article. But in this "Tech tuesday" update, there are 4 articles, not only one.  First about blockchain game, second about DEX public alpha testing, 3rd about Komodo reqward on ledger and 4th about GIN KMD DPOW. should we consider only the first article about gaming?

[15-Feb-19 04:27 PM] LeFevre#5755
hmm Convert Values :PeepoThink:    Understand encrypt values

[15-Feb-19 04:31 PM] cryptocat#9465

[15-Feb-19 04:37 PM] Strob#3417
And Byzantine, does that mean 1 or 2 pillars should be excluded?

convert it to something

[15-Feb-19 04:41 PM] LeFevre#5755
then sha256 it i spose

[15-Feb-19 04:41 PM] LeFevre#5755
if we suppose to interpret "strong" as bold

[15-Feb-19 04:42 PM] Strob#3417
exactly what I tried

[15-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Strob#3417
Just missing the byzantine part....

[15-Feb-19 04:43 PM] LeFevre#5755
ya, not 100% sure what "convert" means

[15-Feb-19 04:43 PM] LeFevre#5755
in this situation

[15-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Strob#3417
related to Byzantine generals?

[15-Feb-19 04:43 PM] LeFevre#5755
encrypt I would go with sha256

[15-Feb-19 04:44 PM] LeFevre#5755
byzantine fault tolerance, which leads to dPoW

yep, the GIN KMD 51% attack

ü§∑

[15-Feb-19 04:51 PM] LeFevre#5755
guess for step 2, we need to do something with this byzantine/dPoW(?)   hint

[15-Feb-19 04:51 PM] Strob#3417
So what should we convert the pillars to? Addresses, WIF, anything else?

[15-Feb-19 04:51 PM] Strob#3417
Morse code?

[15-Feb-19 04:52 PM] LeFevre#5755
would be weird if we had to make a wallet

[15-Feb-19 04:52 PM] LeFevre#5755
get the wif

[15-Feb-19 04:52 PM] LeFevre#5755
sha256 it

[15-Feb-19 04:52 PM] Strob#3417
I did that but did not work. I got the address and wif for all titles, put them together with and without spaces to convert them to sha256 and it did not work.

[15-Feb-19 04:53 PM] Strob#3417
I tried removing one of them , the second, the thrid the forth and so on, like if one is a traitor, but it was not that either

[15-Feb-19 04:54 PM] Strob#3417
So i will wwait for next clue!

[15-Feb-19 04:54 PM] LeFevre#5755
hehe

[15-Feb-19 04:54 PM] LeFevre#5755
ya, think the step 2: convert might be a hang up

[15-Feb-19 04:54 PM] LeFevre#5755
atm

[15-Feb-19 04:55 PM] LeFevre#5755
assume the byzantine hint is trying to help us with that part

[15-Feb-19 05:29 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
If the pillars was answer ,he should just mentioned pillars

[15-Feb-19 06:03 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
What is strong in the article?? Besides the headings

[15-Feb-19 06:04 PM] cryptocat#9465
Why do you think the headings are strong??

[15-Feb-19 06:05 PM] cryptocat#9465
Ok I've created an address to find the seed for step 1. Tweet coming in a minute.

[15-Feb-19 06:05 PM] mazyar_lp#3486

@KomodoPlatform To help with this #cryptopuzzle here's the address to the first step of the puzzle (with a bonus prize of 7.77 $KMD). There are 3 steps in total to finding the seed to the winning address. More clues coming soon.

[15-Feb-19 06:08 PM] LeFevre#5755
lol

[15-Feb-19 06:09 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
But i dont remember which one. I tried thousands of solutions :))

[15-Feb-19 06:16 PM] LeFevre#5755
cause there only one strong heading :PeepoThink:

[15-Feb-19 06:18 PM] cryptocat#9465
Read clue 1 again

[15-Feb-19 06:18 PM] LeFevre#5755
ya, dont get byzantine is the problem with clue 1

[15-Feb-19 06:18 PM] LeFevre#5755
lol

[15-Feb-19 06:19 PM] LeFevre#5755

`Each header seperates complicated things marked by strong`

[15-Feb-19 07:21 PM] Strob#3417
@cryptocat  "Why do you think the headings are strong??" Because they use a stronger font!

[15-Feb-19 07:22 PM] LeFevre#5755

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Strob#3417
So when you say strong you are not talking about the font? Other than that what is strong: Komodo, jl777, python, dPoW ....

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] LeFevre#5755
I would say he is going with the html

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] LeFevre#5755
hence my stuff up top

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] cryptocat#9465
haha you have failed to understand what I am getting at

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] LeFevre#5755
I just dont understand the byzantine

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] cryptocat#9465
Read clue 1 again lol

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] LeFevre#5755
and if its not the <strong>

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] LeFevre#5755
thats a rough hint

[15-Feb-19 07:24 PM] LeFevre#5755
`Clue 1: Each pillar separates an army of strong Byzantines.`     Each header separates an army of <strong> complicated ideas

[15-Feb-19 07:24 PM] cryptocat#9465
That's it

[15-Feb-19 07:24 PM] Strob#3417
Heach headings, so each title separates an army of strong Byzantines.....

[15-Feb-19 07:25 PM] LeFevre#5755
but only one header is <strong></strong>

[15-Feb-19 07:27 PM] cryptocat#9465
If you think of it like a sandwich...it's not the bread that you need...:6849_pepeold:

[15-Feb-19 07:27 PM] LeFevre#5755
yea, so I dont want to use the headers

[15-Feb-19 07:28 PM] LeFevre#5755
I want to use all the other things that are strong

the other "bold" lines are not actually <strong>.  So...idk

[15-Feb-19 07:32 PM] LeFevre#5755
hmmph

[15-Feb-19 07:38 PM] Strob#3417
So strong Byzantines means strong alphabet letters (roman alphabet)

[15-Feb-19 07:39 PM] Strob#3417
Now what do we need to do with those strong Byzantines cause entering them as a passphrase doesn't seem to open the first address

[15-Feb-19 07:40 PM] LeFevre#5755
sounds like the level 1 should be plaintext for the wallet

[15-Feb-19 07:40 PM] Strob#3417
Hint please!

[15-Feb-19 07:40 PM] LeFevre#5755
we still not understanding what we are suppose to collect

Step 2: Byzantine

[15-Feb-19 08:22 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
for 7 kmd adress??

[15-Feb-19 08:26 PM] LeFevre#5755
are the strong seperated by spaces/new lines?   Is Punctuation involved?

[15-Feb-19 08:27 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
no new lines...

guess the next move would be that "strong" does not imply <strong>
