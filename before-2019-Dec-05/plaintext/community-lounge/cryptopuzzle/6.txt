Is "the soul of #KMD" a word or group of word directly in the article?

[08-Feb-19 11:08 PM] cryptocat#9465
What hashing methods should we consider?
- SHA256
- PBKDF2 (though it requires iteration and key length to be set)
- MD5 (not secure enough?)
- SHA1 (again not secure enough?)

[08-Feb-19 11:11 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
bitcoin hashing i think

[08-Feb-19 11:11 PM] cryptocat#9465
hmm

[08-Feb-19 11:11 PM] Strob#3417
SHA256 I think otherwise you don't get a valid WIF

I tried all the keywords as salt or vice versa with "Komodo is ahead of Decred" and also without salt but just adding the words on one line and one 2 lines, hashed them in SHA256 and still nothing. I need another hint sadly...

[08-Feb-19 11:16 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
soul of komodo is salt do u agree?

If i were an evil, i'll apply blake2b hash with salt into puzzle ) Hope, ca333 was not so angry when created puzzle ))

[09-Feb-19 02:24 AM] Decker#3767
But, even this "soul" is a big question now )

[09-Feb-19 02:41 AM] Decker#3767
Just want to remember what we have:

1. "level1" - something from level1, could be anything, like txid of level1, blockhash of level1, or just "Komodo is ahead of Decred" string.
2. "soul" of komodo ... - can be soul of Komodo ))
3. F - unknown hash function with unknown arguments ... 

So, we can act as:

1. F(level1+soul)
2. F(soul+level1)
3. F(level1)+soul
4. level1+F(soul)
5. soul+F(level1)
6. F(soul)+level1
...
and many different ways )

[09-Feb-19 02:42 AM] Decker#3767
And other thing ... if we guess that something from level1 is a txid `befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2` don't forget that we can hash it as string itself "befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2" (64 symbols) or binary data {0xbe, 0xfb ... } (32 symbols) ...

[09-Feb-19 12:05 PM] Strob#3417
@mazyar_lp Well yes he said that but remember what he said for previous puzzle? like "yes - it can be solved just by looking on picture + first hint (brain/heart)." about the sudoku but in fact we needed to also know that we must use Agama and that we must paste the answer on 2 lines to take advantage of the bug in Agama.... There was no way I could have guess that without a hint. So that was not entirely true. So later he may come up with a hint to something we are still missing.

[09-Feb-19 12:12 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Totally agreed

[09-Feb-19 12:51 PM] cryptocat#9465
I'd like to know if it's only one level of hashing/encryption required. Do we need to hash a value to get the Salt, then use SHA256 to get a final hashed value?

[09-Feb-19 01:07 PM] cryptocat#9465
The salt could be the level 1 address or tx

[09-Feb-19 01:07 PM] cryptocat#9465
and the text required for SHA256 is the "soul"

[09-Feb-19 01:08 PM] cryptocat#9465
I really hope the final seed is a SHA256 value üòë

[09-Feb-19 03:14 PM] Strob#3417
Yes I tried level 1 sentence as salt and soul as hashed text and vice versa, but none of my "soul" seems to be right. I even tried "soul" itself! lol

[09-Feb-19 03:16 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Something is missing. Without hint someone could accidentally find the right pass

[09-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Strob#3417
We need to know what is the soul (and it could be almost anything, anyone and even an animal) we need to know how to enter it and where and we need to know how to enter level 1 phrase how and where too. and since we need hashing we need to know what to hash and how. So too many unknown so far leading me to think that ca333 want this to last a few weeks so hype can build up a bit with more 777 kmd added to the pot each week. üòâ

[09-Feb-19 03:38 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I think the opposite. They dont want the prize to be increased. They can make other puzzles for kmd promotion

Agreed, encryption/hashing generating a SHA256 value out of some string of words is not exactly nice. Don't forget the "salt" It's next to the pepper.

and yes - you guys have been damn close. thats why i couldnt hint much more - since its a bigger puzzle i am sure you understand. we will continue with the bi-weekly 77.7 KMD puzzles. i have 2 new ones already in the repo waiting to get cracked.

Hi. Do someone know how to generate the KMD private key from passphrase? I try the passphrase of level 1 in the paperwallet generator of Komodo and I got the correct private key only if I check the "iguana compatible" option. What  does this option do on the encryption process?

[10-Feb-19 12:00 PM] ca333#0118
@Gam_B1t : https://github.com/ca333/swingtokenGUI/blob/master/src/java/com/vaklinov/zcashui/SeedImportDialog.java#L211

this is the WIF derivation procedure from a seed/passphrase.

this java code contains all you need. if you have any issues/question just ping me again. @jl777c explained/teached it to me (on a cryptographic level) back in the day via some good C code. it is a core feature of the iguana protocol (= software layer that all our technologies are based on: komodo, dpow, jumblr, barterDEX, etc.) in https://github.com/jl777/supernet for those who are curious.

Bcz it can be person, or programming language, or algo (equihash), or hash type (blake2b) as well ...

[10-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Decker#3767
the only thing i noticed mentioned in article related to "soul" is a "original spirit of crypto" )

yep, KMD have "spirit of crypto" inside )

[10-Feb-19 06:13 PM] Strob#3417

according to modern science our brain stores the info which makes us unique as a human. it gives us a unique character, personality, etc. etc. etc. so actually - cant the brain be what basically represents our soul?

[10-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Decker#3767
Bcz hashing of the most obvious things - seems gives nothing.

[10-Feb-19 08:12 PM] Strob#3417
@ca333 would be cool if you could put some KMD is solution that close to the answer, that way we could know if we are close! (and post the addresses too)

[10-Feb-19 08:15 PM] Strob#3417
what bugs me now is the "hashing something is involved". Cause it could be any hashing method, we could enter the hash as passphrase or WIF, combined with level 1 or has of level 1, we hash level 1 or the soul? Too many possibilities. And since I tried all the most obvious ones I think, it means it's not a obvious one!

[10-Feb-19 08:18 PM] Strob#3417
Also "http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/R9JwschmLT3H6RpeiJ8QsEkfurBSY1AWd3 ‚Ä¶ - this is level 1. You can reach it by using the most important piece of info from the article."

[10-Feb-19 08:19 PM] Strob#3417
That could mean that the address itself is level 1 (the sentence "Komodo is ahead of Decred" was used to reach level 1 but was not level 1 itself...), or maybe the txid or the balance 3,33. What element of "level 1" do we need to use to get to level 2?

[10-Feb-19 08:22 PM] cryptocat#9465
or "level I"

[10-Feb-19 08:25 PM] Strob#3417
level 1 is maybe exactly :"http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/R9JwschmLT3H6RpeiJ8QsEkfurBSY1AWd3"

[10-Feb-19 08:25 PM] Strob#3417

What is the website you use in your capture @Strob ?

[10-Feb-19 08:35 PM] Decker#3767
In PHP you can simple use something like this `hash("sha256",$something)` to obtain SHA256 hash.

[10-Feb-19 08:36 PM] Decker#3767
And this `hash_hmac('sha256', $something, $salt)` for  HMAC SHA256 ...
