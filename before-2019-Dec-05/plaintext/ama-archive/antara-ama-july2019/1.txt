everyone We'll be holding an AMA on Discord about the Antara Framework and Komodo's upcoming rebrand. This is a great time to get your questions in. The AMA will go live on the 2nd of July 5 PM UTC. 

Before you ask your questions, make sure to read our announcement blog post about the Antara Framework: https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-is-introducing-antara-an-end-to-end-smart-chain-development-framework/

And also make sure to visit the Evolution Website:  https://evolve.komodoplatform.com/

We are asking our community to post their questions in this channel, and we'll choose the most popular ones based on how many ‚¨Ü  each question receives. We will also answer questions live, if time permits.

What is the benefit of Antera to KMD holders? The blog post says that Antara chains are independent of the Komodo chain and KMD coin. So how is this related to Komodo ?

[28-Jun-19 05:04 PM] Ooloo#6672
@jl777c would you mind being a little bit more transparent with your response rather than just providing a link? Based on your article I can assume you are under the premise that it is KMD's inherent interoperability that gives it value within the ecosystem. This ultimately creates a "spider web" effect of value as the ecosystem grows larger?

How is komodo being rebranded?

[01-Jul-19 01:17 PM] Audo#5667
Few other notes and clarifications about information that we have already shared.

 - The much waited rebrand is going live on July 15th together with the Antara Framework launch.
 - Antara is a framework used to develop customizeable and purpose-built Smart Chains
 - 'Chain Lizard' was an codename for the blockchain generator app. The branded name is "Antara Composer" (Antara Smart Chain Composer)
 - Antara Composer app is used to launch new Smart Chains on AWS infastructure within a minute (new product)
 - AtomicDEX is a multi-coin wallet with atomic swap support. It is currently in closed beta & heavy testing. (new product)

P.S. Remember to upvote ‚¨Ü questions that you think should get an answer. We haven't received tons of questions yet but incase we do those upvotes will help us pick the most requested ones.

Here's a list of rebrand related articles we have recently published. They will help anyone get up to speed about Komodo.
