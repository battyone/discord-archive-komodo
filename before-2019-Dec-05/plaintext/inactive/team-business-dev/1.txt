Our community requested a 'business-dev' channel and @Nelg from the business dev team agreed it's a good idea and will be monitoring the channel to answer questions.

[11-Jul-18 07:42 PM] Regnar#6164
Awesome. So this is the primary business dev channel on discord, is it secondary to another public channel somewhere else? or has bus dev been private so far?

[11-Jul-18 11:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pretty much private so far

[11-Jul-18 11:56 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay so what type of information can we expect to be updated here? or is this just for community to suggest business ideas

[11-Jul-18 11:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

**Contacts to Blockchain areas of consulting firms**

Consulting firms are where businesses turn to rent brain power. When they don‚Äôt know how to approach something, don‚Äôt know if there is a better way to do something, don‚Äôt know if they can truly implement something (like a blockchain) they turn to consultants. They don‚Äôt turn to blockchain companies to ask if it works, because that‚Äôs like asking a car salesman if you need a car. So getting in with some consulting firms would be crucial. 

Consulting firms are looking for cutting edge ways to bring value to their clients, a Komodo official partnership with them could give them the tools to recommend blockchain products to their clients, these firms aren‚Äôt going to recommend building on a platform they don‚Äôt know or trust, because they are in the business of being right, not throwing ideas at a wall. 

Here‚Äôs some blockchain focused contacts at the top consulting firms in the United States and World

^^^I think this guy might be the best bet to go to first. He's young and labels himself cryptocurrency lead at EY on his twitter, and cryptoasset leader on linkedin. This is a big step up for the other roles which are "blockchain" and try to avoid the crypto part. He may be more receptive to hearing us out, and he actually has experience with integrating blockchains into businesses.

The US government also uses these consulting firms to decide on how to implement new technology. Booz Allen Hamilton is very big in government contracts and consulting as 1/3rd of their entire work force are military veterans. One strong avenue of approach would be to try and target products to the GSA.

The GSA acts as the primary procurement and distribution branch for most government agencies for supplies. Including the military. It seems Booz Allen Hamilton is probably the go to consulting firm dealing with US gov. Anything with NSN can be procured through GSA, they are the big ones.
Which means they are big in the contracting business and the audit, tracking, and verification of contracts could easily be suited for blockchains. Problem is we'd be going against probably IBM. But that hasn't stopped Factom or other blockchain companies from securing DHS contracts and grants (though Factom has a foundation based in Texas which is similar to how I figured we‚Äôd structure the Komodo entity)

Great idea,  been thinking about applications that can utilize the tps capability that KMD is building. For instance;  How many txt msgs/emails are there per second in the world?  how many unique instances of some sort of conditional data exchange  occur at or near this rate.?... I'm assuming that kmd will be first to demonstrably prove this tps capability. Need to do more research, just food for thought.

It would be better to compare our scaling solution to ERC20's on ETH, i.e each ERC20 can scale on its own, rather than use the ETH blockchain. The design of the system enable's it to scale to infinity, as long as the Internet has enough bandwidth and computers to handle the transactions. I think James stated it as "limited by the capacity of the entire internet" 
You can make chain clusters, with MoMoM so that a bunch of chains act as one single giant chain, and you can send transactions from one chain to another.  But creating one giant cluster that has all transactions in the world on it, kind of defeats the purpose of designing a system like this. To do that why not just make one blockchain with 1Gb blocks?

@blackjok3r  Erc20 tx data onchain,  it's more like colored coins than independent chains,  current "mineable " eth token assets are like  NXTs custom currencies .   To answer your question, clusters or even a big cluster allows for partitioning different segments of the network based off of function .   For example ,  with KBS  a cluster of 3 chains, one for debt recording , one for credit recording and one for vouchers.  The first an ac_private=1 chain , to keep private people's debt the 2nd an ac_public=1 chain,  to allow trading among network participants,  and the 3rd utilizing burn protocol with the 2nd so that consumers can participate without joining.  Having each isolated prevents potential congestion based mishaps.  I expect the third to have a lot more tx volume than the other 2 .  However, actions on the other two are the ones that are required to be reported.

Hey guys, would there be possibility to make "more smart icos" using our DEX? More smart I mean - currently ICOs are more or less " give us all money right now, so we start the product production". But another possibility like could be very interesting for investors: money locked in smart contract, and pay while most investors (or bigest holders - options) agree. If no agreement reached for some defined period -> money sent back to investors wallet (+possibility to define different address then incoming address). So that only the first ICO part would be paid to start the business, and investors could agree to pay the rest BTC while the first part is successfully delivered (which is confirmed by investors vote. This requires that New Token XXX and investors BTC are frozen, and only exchanged after voting/agreement using some kind of smart contract. sth like that if it make sense? I believe it requires very big trust to give all money right away. Investing using partial payments seems more reasonable. Ofcourse this could be done without smart contracts, but  ICO owners must have some warrant theere are some BTC waiting frozen and will be paid after doing the job. Does it make sense ?

Basically a bridge loan with the next rounds approved assuming different milestones are met. Private equity often does this when they make intermittent investments in a firm to reach certain development or growth targets. I can't see why this wouldn't be possible, but there may be a subjective aspect of this. It would be a good idea though, especially for institutional investors. It's a great idea

[16-Jul-18 06:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don't think ICO are the way to push forward with the tech.  At least not the kind we have seen in crypto.  Registered securities is another story

[16-Jul-18 07:30 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@polycryptoblog  most ICOs to me currently is like buying  a pig in a poke. So having the possibility to make it in rounds could be a way of introducing more reliable projects funding and more trusted investor-developer relation? But also this mechanism could be used maybe for other purposes. Personally I would trust more a project that will take money in rounds after reaching milstones. However this requires also a platform for discussions and voting - and here we land back into my old propaganda - that what internet folks need most currently is decent secure voting online + a real decent forum engine. So that people can well discuss (or more like "process knowledge together" in an optimal way). BTW discussing is a kind of game, which optimal rules (discussion cycles, source linking, weighing knowledge sources, topics and common interest validation) maybe are not yet defined at all.

[16-Jul-18 09:28 PM] Regnar#6164
"Personally I would trust more a project that will take money in rounds after reaching milestones." same. and I think a lot of investors think the same. when it comes to voting it would be fairly simple to airdrop votes to the holders (though pretty sure this would make them securities) which is useful if a project has taken money from N amount of investors.

[16-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Regnar#6164
I think there is a fine line with development and funding. too much funding and they are likely to squander it and spend frivolously on things they could have taken care of in house (think Daymond John, Power of Broke) and too little money and they obviously can't make ends meet. So the bridge concept is an effective one.

[16-Jul-18 09:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Could be a good selling point. Long term this approach could be preferred also by law makers and this way propagated as a better way. Should be even this year many people crying for bad ICOs to law makers.

[16-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I think it's a viable future fundraising requirement.

[17-Jul-18 12:00 AM] Regnar#6164
though it would take some tweaking to make the additional funding more objective upon completion of milestones

[17-Jul-18 12:04 AM] Steve Lee#1967
I suggested something similar awhile back when Vitalik first proposed his DAICO model - built in voting of funds being released, as well as a vote option for full refund if certain development milestones or promises were not met

[17-Jul-18 12:04 AM] Steve Lee#1967
would be a custom solution that needs to be built. but i still think it is a needed solution the industry needs.

[17-Jul-18 11:16 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure about the refund model, seeing as most investors would prefer the money they give to a business actually be spent and used to achieve the goals of the business. Investors, at least institutional investors, don't give money to a company so it sits on it, gambles with it, or anything else non operational, they give it so the company spends it on what's needed to achieve growth. 

Having a refund button for stages of funding probably won't work. that money is gone.

[17-Jul-18 11:19 AM] Regnar#6164
obviously this is different than simply raising money initially, if they raise enough in a single round they may not need spend it all and a refund could be necessary, but again, that's the whole point of staged fundraising, so that only increments of investor money is at risk at a time and only enough money is given to fund up to the next milestone. It is also incentive for legitimate projects to develop. This could root out a lot of scam projects but there is still the risk of a scam taking the initial funding, or "developing" in private and saying they met goals but that's why we verify.

[17-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Steve Lee#1967
a refund could only be initiated if a high majority vote of all contributors agreed, and i'm sure it would also be stake weighted. this was only in an extreme case, and wouldn't be on a per user basis.

Waves, IOTA, Ardor, NEM, Komodo are all projects with roots in NXT. From what I understand Ardor held the keys to the kingdom and started breaking these projects with their updates and forced all these DEVS to splinter off.

@BlackJesus, KMD and NEM existed long before ARDR was even in the works and both IOTA and Waves existed before ARDR was off of test net, and may have been around before there was talk of ARDR as well. I lived most of NXT's history with a 1 year gap where I stopped paying attention to crypto all together (which is why I am not sure about Waves and IOTA, they were released during that year I wasn't paying attention).

[27-Jul-18 07:46 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
On an unrelated note, I have a business solution proof-of-concept I want to build. Does anyone have connections with blockchain savvy Golang and/or QTscript developers who may be interested?

I can start the project by myself, but it will take forever for me to finish without some help.

I don't have a budget set yet, but I would like to develop to connections early.

[27-Jul-18 08:41 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@PTYX, was looking at Chainzilla, seems interesting. Seems a lot like the kind of business I want to launch with the proof of concept. You guys are one step ahead of me.

[27-Jul-18 08:45 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I have a tendency to to always be 10 steps ahead and unable to advance due to lack of interest or 1 step behind because I wait too long for the interest to build before advancing.

Perhaps joining up with Chainzilla would be my best move. I have been involved with cryptocurrency and blockchain since late 2013 or early 2014 and I can program backend in Java and Golang.

[20-Aug-18 01:47 AM] Mylo#8306
being early days, maybe license chainzilla tech or have a business agreement where they do the tech work and you mange your own customers - on both sides, backend and customer management, a lot of education and double up work.  i know with pioneers we can do 80% of the work, but in reality, the 20% will be  exhausting.  pty is looking to be the redhat of blockchain service providers.  if 10 blockchain projects wanted to onboard with zilla at the same time, maybe they can't handle the education component.  plenty of growth in the future - providing best service to end customers in education and consulting is the best way.

[20-Aug-18 01:50 AM] Mylo#8306
and no offence to zilla, if they can handle 10 all at once, then maybe i meant 30.  at some point there is finite human resources to handle the work.  as early adopters of the tech, no point cutting each other's grass.  so many services to be built on and around the tech.
