We couldn't handle more than 5 at a time right now

[20-Aug-18 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
A year from now I expect to be able to handle 10 at a time or more once the marketing tools we are working on are ready. Community, marketing, and PR seems to be a huge part of the success of a project so we have to provide solutions within the scope of ICO. If there isn't an ICO involved we can definitely handle 30

Hi, i'm new to the Komodo community, besides Smart Contracts in the way, i was wondering if there was any plan for CDN, Hardware or Mining rental for blockchains developed with Komodo?, if so, new developers could deploy their solution in minutes and start injecting FIAT to the community of Komodo miners, i think it will make Komodo the most notable equihash coin without removing complete autonomy to the new blockchains created on Komodo. With all the equihash power of ASIC and GPU in the community, renting Sol/h and Gb to developers in a descentralizad manner seems pretty interesting and will make the new blockchains much more cheap to deploy and scale initially, at least until the coin gets enough value to attract miners. If the blockchain gains traction Komodo gains by retaining some of the coins, if not, the solution may still be useful and applied for the final users and will get some FIAT besides dPOW and Trading. In essence all you need to implement this is a balancer structure that redirects miners to different Blockchains accordingly, and the automated payments of course.

[27-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Prado#3941
Komodo is the more powerful and flexible Blockchain development platform i have seen but its been opaqued by the easy to use and popularity of NEM, Stellar and others (at least in my initial investigation),  i would love to help with my team to make it happen, pay KMD to deploy in a click the infrastructure rented for your blockchain solution, dPOW makes it maybe the only platform that could make this right now, as renting a couple miners for your solution without dPOW will be dangerous for most DAPPs in an open blockchain. Also it could help automatize almost all the current revenue model of Komodo making the coin even more Liquid.

yes, pretty sure someone has already set up a mining pool that rotates between assetchains. @xRobeSx I think did it

[27-Aug-18 08:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Ah, thought you were also experimenting with a stratum that automatically switched assetchains or something along those lines. I usually just skim this channel, so could have misread/misinterpreted on my end

[27-Aug-18 12:30 PM] PTYX#6840
@0x03 has a pool

@PTYX can you explain that for me? Are you talking about the end of FFA or the change in rewards?

[28-Aug-18 01:52 AM] PTYX#6840
The end of FFA makes mining unnecessary to secure our chain

[28-Aug-18 01:52 AM] PTYX#6840
So I am OK with only having the notaries mine our chain.

[28-Aug-18 01:59 AM] Regnar#6164

As komodo attracts more h/s will the rewards would be adjusted to show the current security of the network? Example: if all equihash coins make a hardfork to protect from current ASIC there will be Th/s of ASIC available for komodo,  this could make the external dPOW less necessary and save a lot money in BTC attracting more developers, miners and even other blockchains (as the dPOW would be much more cheap and faster) also it will inject more FIAT as mining (or Holding) wouldn't  be the best option to pay for the dPOW in a competitive scenario like that, also hash power could be rented to protect small chains between dPOWs (injecting even more FIAT from developers, startups and organizations), 10 minutes its a small lapse of time to hit komodo, but its enough to ruin most dAPPs, ICOs or Smart Contracts logics and structure. It will contain all projects in consortium and private or semi private structures forever, removing some of the best properties of owning your own open, exchange capable, minable and personalizable blockchain

[28-Aug-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you seem to be making a lot of assumptions based on other assumptions, based on other assumptions being extrapolated

[28-Aug-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
first off, ZEC is unlikely to fork

[28-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea how not notarizing attracts more devs

[28-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Prado#3941
Im just really exited for all komodo possibilities

[28-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
let's just take one step at a time

[28-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Prado#3941
we will be bringing at least 5 projects to komodo this year

[28-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Prado#3941
as CTO of the projects i want to understand all pros and cons

[28-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
current hashrate is relatively unchanged from prior to ASIC release

[28-Aug-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
its fine to try to understand, but I think risky to make too many extrapolations

[28-Aug-18 07:43 AM] Prado#3941
Yeas i've seen that, ZEC it's attracting most of the hash power on the market

[28-Aug-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
due to the (no) cost structure that KMD offers, I expect a lot of projects will use KMD, after all who likes to pay $5 txfees

[28-Aug-18 07:44 AM] Prado#3941
but i thing komodo is the future of equihash

[28-Aug-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
until ZEC hashrate triples, I dont think KMD mining is better profitability and that is a lot of hashrate that is needed

[28-Aug-18 07:44 AM] Prado#3941
not zec

[28-Aug-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
well, if KMD price goes up 3x, then it likely becomes the best thing to mine (for that day's ROI)

[28-Aug-18 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is very difficult to predict hashrates, market prices, across multiple coins

[28-Aug-18 07:46 AM] Prado#3941
ZEC wont fork as it would handle tons of hash rate to the only project that has notary as service business model

[28-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Prado#3941
But as more good coins and projects get to use komodo the proccess will be natural i think

[28-Aug-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont see 10 minute blocktimes, with removal of F4A period, we should get very consistent blocktimes all the time

[28-Aug-18 07:49 AM] Prado#3941
No thats ok, the only problem i've seen to komodo it's easy of use, and branding and as far as i know it's been solved as we speak i think is a good bet in all senses

[28-Aug-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we are working on continuously improving all areas

[28-Aug-18 07:50 AM] Prado#3941
i'm happy to get to know this project we already show it to some VC ins Mexico and have big plans for it

[28-Aug-18 07:51 AM] Prado#3941
if we can help in any developing process we would happy to bring something back to the project

[28-Aug-18 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are making projects on KMD, maybe you want a channel in the ecosystem section?

[28-Aug-18 07:53 AM] Prado#3941
Yeah i've already sent some mails for it

[28-Aug-18 07:54 AM] Mylo#8306
if PoW mining is a concern, there is PoS, also combination of PoW/PoS.   In the future there is the possibility of not only equihash mining.

it's nice to see your enthusiasm.  plenty of possibilities with kmd.  don't be shy with questions.

[28-Aug-18 07:54 AM] Prado#3941
The owner of one VC actually wants to make smart contracts to auto invest in projects with sales kpis based on komodo

[28-Aug-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
what name do you want the channel to be?

if/once profitability calculators take NNs into account, the likelihood of switching en masse to KMD will likely be short-lived

[28-Aug-18 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Depends on price, it would be stupid to have notaries mine 75% of blocks if KMD was $1000 for instance, IMO

[28-Aug-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
per diff/hash KMD has to be 4x in value to any other coin to be equal in profitability

[01-Sep-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
in other words when KMD is 10x current prices relative to the other coins, it would be 2.5x more profitable to mine than the others

[09-Sep-18 11:29 PM] FLO team#2752
Hi, I hate to use this notification, but if possible could someone from the @Team  Admin please take the time to discuss the 51% attack mitigation software available with KMD?

Does it cost Komodo anything to provide dPoW to other coins?

[13-Sep-18 09:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or is the 300kmd fee just to help with kmd to Btc notarizations

[13-Sep-18 09:09 AM] sœÜldat#8733
The current rate for this is 300 KMD and 800 of the coin to be secured per year.

[13-Sep-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this will depend on how many there are really.

[13-Sep-18 09:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
as in does it have a cost burden on kmd to dPoW others?

[13-Sep-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we have to secure every single coin that is compatble... the amout of servers and KMD needed would be insane

[13-Sep-18 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or regardless we notarise to Btc and will always cost the same on our end

[13-Sep-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only problem at the moment is that all coins are usig the same key and wallet, IMO and experiance the 3rd party coins, really need to use a diffrent notary key.

[13-Sep-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if we can do that, there is really no limit to how many can be noarized for very little cost.

[13-Sep-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD blocks are quite empty still.

[13-Sep-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can fit a lot of notarizations in there

Mostly the issues we are running into with STAKED are due to the MoMoM stuff, which dPoW does not actually need. Once I get this finished then I can check out if dPoW works easily with a second set of pubkeys.
