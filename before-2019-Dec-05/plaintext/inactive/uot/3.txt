when adding faucetfund i receive an error on client side `couldn't create faucet funding` and server output `nValue too small or already spent in mempool`

what is the exact rpc call you are doing?

Thanks. I actually found out the issue.

@jl777c  When starting a new komodod it requires a default config file to be created by the user. I would be nice if the system could look for a config file, if not present, should automatically create a new config file with default configurations. If it is required i can implement it.

it does create a default config file for assetchains

I'm always prompted to create a default config file.

Let me cross check it again.

Hi, I am trying to install Komodo in my Ubuntu 16.04 (4gb ram). 
when I issue the command: ./zcutil/build.sh -j4 (using 4 threads), its ran for more than 1 hour and hung my laptop. 
Is my laptop memory too low to install Komodo?

[19-Nov-18 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe -j1 for a low mem system

[19-Nov-18 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
just run build.sh again, it should resume where it stopped
