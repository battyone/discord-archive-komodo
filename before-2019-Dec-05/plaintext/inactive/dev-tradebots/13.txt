indicates error on sending fee by alice. what coin?

[02-Jul-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
SUPERNET

[02-Jul-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so a windows specific tx signing bug for SUPERNET... any other coins have the same problem?

[02-Jul-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'll have to check later, at the time all I had on the rig was sn and coqui and bobs were ignoring couqi offers altogether

[02-Jul-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
windows and native ?

[02-Jul-18 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes to both (using qt wallet)

[02-Jul-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm doing a rescan on that wallet, atm,, there seems to be a conflicting total balance between that wallet and my normal trading nix wallet; not sure if that could be part/all of the issue or not

[02-Jul-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is likely something related to wallet, if the same utxo are used on different nodes, it could get confused, but it should be failing everytime

[02-Jul-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or it could be as simply annoying as:
because, winduhs 😣

[02-Jul-18 08:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure what other reason a node with `connect` would have a different balance than the node it's connected too

[03-Jul-18 05:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
the change to komodo dev branch allows now again to sync KV thanks!

[03-Jul-18 11:20 AM] cipi#4502
i need to stop electrum2 in Europe, so i can use it as a source for blockchain-data and electrum-databases (i am about to install 9 new electrums)... the requests to electrum2 will be served by NA

woot

[04-Jul-18 08:52 AM] jorian#4555
i need some help with the latest additions gtc and the other one 😅

[04-Jul-18 08:53 AM] jorian#4555
so until before those changes, i could define a maxprice and a volume in my buy order. if there was no matching order, nothing would happen and i would need to decrease my volume or increase the price.

[04-Jul-18 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
now, i see this:
```2998 uuid.96905dc380817bc774115a666f8c84fc M.0 g.0 f.0      request   BTC/KMD     0.09938556 -> 399.90010000 (4031.83790060) | RT.0 0 n0
2998 uuid.96905dc380817bc774115a666f8c84fc M.0 g.0 f.0     reserved   BTC/KMD     0.05312318 -> 177.73337777 (3358.32763205) | RT.0 0 n0```

[04-Jul-18 08:56 AM] jorian#4555
and i dont understand what's happening. first, the volume i specified is lowered to 177 KMD. i get 0.05312 BTC for that, meaning that it has a price of 3358

[04-Jul-18 08:58 AM] jorian#4555
that would make it a good deal for me, if it actually connected, which it doesn't: quote validate error -2

[04-Jul-18 08:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`gtc:0 fill:1 is fill or kill
gtc:1 fill:1 is a good till canceled and filled
gtc:1 fill:0 is good till cancelled or partially filled`

[04-Jul-18 08:59 AM] jorian#4555
so if i define fill:1, the behaviour would be as before the changes?

[04-Jul-18 08:59 AM] jorian#4555
and gtc:0

[04-Jul-18 09:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
afaik, gtc:0 fill:1 *should be* kill any remaining bits not filled

[04-Jul-18 09:02 AM] jorian#4555
(there is no documentation about this on docs.komodoplatform.com as far as i can see)

[04-Jul-18 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and 0 0 is "If I can't fill it all right now, then I don't want anything"

[04-Jul-18 09:02 AM] jorian#4555
so why does the above happen

[04-Jul-18 09:03 AM] jorian#4555
if i understand you correctly, nothing should've happened

[04-Jul-18 09:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it may be that you understand me, but I'm wrong

[04-Jul-18 09:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
as far as 00, I'm going by what was added to the GUI

[04-Jul-18 09:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
they put "Fill immediate or cancel order"

[04-Jul-18 09:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the 3 I quoted in code tags was direct from james

[04-Jul-18 09:06 AM] jorian#4555
ok, i just added fill:1 to my buy and it indeed just killed. i think g.0 f.1 is behaviour as it was before

[04-Jul-18 09:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
one thing I'm certain of, gtc 1 will go on *forever* 😛

[04-Jul-18 09:07 AM] jorian#4555
it's like setting autoprice?

[04-Jul-18 09:07 AM] jorian#4555
or wait

[04-Jul-18 09:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
kinda, it reoffers on a timer

[04-Jul-18 09:08 AM] jorian#4555
yes, actively? bobs are passively waiting for an offer to come by, but gtc is actively sending such an offer onto the market?

[04-Jul-18 09:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
1 1 is kinda like bot offer should be

[04-Jul-18 09:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
gtc 1 fill 0 is like bot that quits on partial fill

[04-Jul-18 09:10 AM] jorian#4555
aha, got it

[04-Jul-18 09:11 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
you can issue a cancel to cli, but you have to know the uuid of the offer

[04-Jul-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
gtc:0 fill:1 was how it was before

[04-Jul-18 09:23 AM] SHossain#0007
fill:0 gtc:1 will stop as soon as any part of the order is done

[04-Jul-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
I am not hearing many complaints about utxo after recent changes, not sure if it is due to problems disappearing or not

[04-Jul-18 09:26 AM] jorian#4555
it still is cumbersome to buy something. busy for 30 minutes now, orders get either stuck at reserved, connect or get quote validate error -2

[04-Jul-18 09:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so far, the only UTXO issue I've seen is that if you place multiple gtc 1 fill 1 offers it will sometimes confuse itself and try to use the same UTXO for more than one
at which point the newly "relocked" UTXO can't be used for the original offer that thought it locked it
But I think it's just edge cases like me that will ever have it happen

[04-Jul-18 09:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`orders get either stuck at reserved, connect `
How much of that is a bad bob issue @jorian ?

[04-Jul-18 09:30 AM] jorian#4555
probably. there's too many bad bobs out there

[04-Jul-18 09:30 AM] SHossain#0007
@jorian are you using electrum or native?

[04-Jul-18 09:31 AM] jorian#4555
btc electrum

[04-Jul-18 09:31 AM] jorian#4555
kmd native

[04-Jul-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
error -2 is a bad bob error

[04-Jul-18 09:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
fwiw ... ZCL electrum is working this morning better than any electrum experience I've ever had 😎

[04-Jul-18 09:33 AM] jorian#4555
oh that's you dumping all that ZCL

[04-Jul-18 09:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"all that" 🤣

[04-Jul-18 09:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it was like 10 block rewards, I think

[04-Jul-18 09:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
maybe 15

[04-Jul-18 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
ZCL electrums worked fine for me on each swap.

[04-Jul-18 09:35 AM] jorian#4555
lol

[04-Jul-18 09:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I swear that electrum, in general, has a personal hatred towards me
It's almost never a good experience

[04-Jul-18 09:37 AM] jorian#4555
```$ ./enable BTC
{"error":"couldnt find coin locally installed","coin":"BTC"}```

[04-Jul-18 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
😭

[04-Jul-18 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
bitcoin-cli is working fine

[04-Jul-18 09:39 AM] SHossain#0007
check if you have `coin.conf` file and it has `txindex=1` in it

[04-Jul-18 09:39 AM] SHossain#0007
`bitcoin.conf`

[04-Jul-18 09:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
fek, I spoke too soon, now I'm timing out again 😭

[04-Jul-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
yeah, that's why i didn't have txindex=1

[04-Jul-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
takes too much space

[04-Jul-18 09:41 AM] jorian#4555
electrum no worky too. well, off we go to CEX then 😅

[04-Jul-18 09:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
_wouldn't know wth to do with a wallet that didn't have txindex=1 😛_

[04-Jul-18 09:41 AM] SHossain#0007
@jorian what is your BTC buy order?

[04-Jul-18 09:42 AM] SHossain#0007
the price?

[04-Jul-18 09:44 AM] jorian#4555
yeah never mind, i'll not convert KMD to BTC and use another source. forced hodl

[04-Jul-18 09:45 AM] jorian#4555
@ComputerGenie it's a server that doesn't have much space, so i used prune on a btc node

[04-Jul-18 09:45 AM] jorian#4555
and when that stopped working, i used electrum

[04-Jul-18 09:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

i installed the new electrum-servers i got from @noashh ... we now have 3 regions (NA, EU, Asia) with 3 electrums in each regions ... the DNS entries are updated and this is the PR for the coins repo: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/104 ... added the third DNS-entry (electrum3), electrum1/2 remained the same (same port) ... had to remove ARG and BLK (ARG wallet is crashing too often and BLK does not work any more, probably because the wallet is very ancient) @pbca26 @lukechilds

[05-Jul-18 09:01 AM] cipi#4502
sure, when there is development happening with the wallets from this coins and i am able to compile their code

[05-Jul-18 12:26 PM] tolken#2655
For the life of me I can’t seem to get any BTC/KMD alice orders to fill.  I have suitable kmd UTXOs (65s, 73 and some others) using gtc 1 and fill 1.  Alice just keeps expiring.  Can’t seem to get past request stage.  Trade amount 0.015 and price of 0.00026. That’s significantly over asking price and someone has a maxvol of 0.02, I’m not clear why I can’t seem to get a match lately. Tried an asset chain (kmd/dex) and that went though (unsurprisingly) without a hitch.

[05-Jul-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If bob is looking for 0.00026, then you want to entice him with 0.000258 not 0.00027

[05-Jul-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
higher than bob if you're buying, lower than bob if you're selling

[05-Jul-18 12:31 PM] tolken#2655
I am only buying generally.

[05-Jul-18 12:31 PM] tolken#2655
(As Alice)

[05-Jul-18 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The other thing to remember is that because BTC is BTC, the markets might not always work and or take hours to move a swap when the mempool is congested or average fees are up

[05-Jul-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or bob may just be a bad boy

[05-Jul-18 12:34 PM] tolken#2655
I suspect probably evil bobs at play. Having same issue with bch.

[05-Jul-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
playing near the edge (0.01) things get really distorted. I have traded for 1 to 10 BTC without troubles (other than the inherent issues with bitcoin)

[05-Jul-18 12:55 PM] tolken#2655
Was kinda amusing, took me weeks before someone successfully traded on my kmd/bch bob, but was probably 5 min and had first kmd btc bob trade. Received 0.016948, so a bit above that threshold.
