a fill or kill order wont stay active very long

[19-Nov-18 08:18 PM] wbradt#2043
So it is not fill or kill?

[19-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it is, but it is given one minute to fill

[19-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no central ordermatch

[19-Nov-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to understand a fully decentralized orderbook cant work exactly like a centralized ordermatch

[19-Nov-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the orderbook actually doesnt exist in any single place. each node constructs its own version of the orderbook

[19-Nov-18 08:25 PM] wbradt#2043
I understand.

[19-Nov-18 08:27 PM] wbradt#2043
I am just a little confused, because fill or kill has a very specific meaning--`buy` seems more like good-till-time, with time being a minute

[19-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
well the effect is that it is filled or killed

[19-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
one minute is the typical blocktime

[19-Nov-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is an "instant"

[19-Nov-18 08:28 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok

[19-Nov-18 08:28 PM] wbradt#2043
So can an alice leave an order open on the order book?

[19-Nov-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
not really, but alice can do a "gtc" order, which is simulated by submitting the same order over and over

[19-Nov-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
and once any part of it fills, it is considered done

[19-Nov-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i know, i know, not what its supposed to be

[19-Nov-18 08:29 PM] wbradt#2043
What about `bot_buy`/ `bot_sell`?

[19-Nov-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
those arent really needed anymore

[19-Nov-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it issues a stream of orders until it is done, or has 10 attempts

[19-Nov-18 08:30 PM] wbradt#2043
Oh ok

[19-Nov-18 08:31 PM] wbradt#2043
Making sure I understand this, bob can leave orders open on the book with `setprice` and `autoprice`?

[19-Nov-18 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
bob responds to alice requests

[19-Nov-18 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so bob "leaves orders" open, but it is a realtime auction between all the bobs for each alice request

[19-Nov-18 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt actually any normal orderbook

[19-Nov-18 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the orderbook is a fiction, an illusion

[19-Nov-18 08:34 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, that makes more sense

[19-Nov-18 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
try not to be so literal about the terms used

[19-Nov-18 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
alternative was to use totally new and unfamiliar language for concepts that are similar

[19-Nov-18 08:35 PM] wbradt#2043
That's fair

[19-Nov-18 08:36 PM] wbradt#2043
But I mean, from what you guys told me, `dump` and `fomo` match the definition of a market order

[19-Nov-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[19-Nov-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but for crypto people, it has meaning

[19-Nov-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you are free to rename things to whatever you want though, it is just the internal docs

[20-Nov-18 07:05 PM] wbradt#2043
Does every order have a uuid?

[20-Nov-18 07:12 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[20-Nov-18 07:21 PM] wbradt#2043
Where is it created? LP_autobuy? Also, is the uuid for each order stored anywhere?

[20-Nov-18 07:24 PM] SHossain#0007
the swapfiles are stored in `~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/SWAPS/`

[20-Nov-18 07:27 PM] wbradt#2043
Does that include data about orders? Or just swaps?

[20-Nov-18 07:31 PM] SHossain#0007
both

[20-Nov-18 07:32 PM] SHossain#0007
few different files gets created for a single swap. they contain all the information

[20-Nov-18 07:32 PM] wbradt#2043
I'm asking about orders not swaps

[20-Nov-18 07:32 PM] wbradt#2043
Can there be only one swap per order?

[20-Nov-18 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
are you talking about alice of bob order?

[20-Nov-18 07:36 PM] wbradt#2043
Bob

[20-Nov-18 07:37 PM] SHossain#0007
there can be multiple swap per order. that depends on the amount of utxos bob has

[20-Nov-18 07:42 PM] wbradt#2043
So is there a uuid for bob orders? And is there one for alice orders?

[20-Nov-18 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
for a swap it is same `uuid`, `quoteid` & `requestid` that bob and alice gets

[20-Nov-18 07:47 PM] wbradt#2043
I'm asking about orders not swaps

[20-Nov-18 07:47 PM] SHossain#0007
orders doesn't have uuid

[20-Nov-18 07:47 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok thanks

[20-Nov-18 08:21 PM] wbradt#2043
Can bobs use the "buy" and "sell" RPC methods?

[20-Nov-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
no, using buy and sell make you alice

[20-Nov-18 08:31 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks @jl777c

[20-Nov-18 08:34 PM] wbradt#2043
@jl777c I asked someone else this earlier but wanted to be sure: Orders do not have UUIDs, right?

[20-Nov-18 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
well, a uuid is created when alice creates the order, but like one hand clapping, without bob answering it, did it really exist?

[20-Nov-18 08:36 PM] wbradt#2043
So they do have UUIDs?

[20-Nov-18 08:39 PM] wbradt#2043
If so, is that the UUID created in `LP_autobuy` here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/LP_ordermatch.c#L1828? @jl777c

[20-Nov-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, also the caller can set a uuid

[20-Nov-18 08:47 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks--I spent a little too long trying to figure out if that was the uuid for a swap or the order

[20-Nov-18 08:47 PM] wbradt#2043
Are the uuid's stored anywhere?

[20-Nov-18 08:47 PM] wbradt#2043
For bob (and maybe alice too)

[20-Nov-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it ends up in the json for the swap request

[20-Nov-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
which then ends up in DB/SWAPS

[20-Nov-18 08:52 PM] wbradt#2043
Is that under the "uuid" key?

[20-Nov-18 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[20-Nov-18 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what else could that be

[20-Nov-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i try to make things clear

[20-Nov-18 08:55 PM] wbradt#2043
I thought it might have been the uuid for the swap

[20-Nov-18 08:55 PM] wbradt#2043
So multiple swaps for the same order can have the same uuid, right?

[20-Nov-18 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
no, each swap is unique

[20-Nov-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
there can be multiple proposed swaps for a single request, they would all have the same uuid, but only one can actually happen

[20-Nov-18 08:58 PM] wbradt#2043
An alice can't do two swaps with two different bobs for one order?

[20-Nov-18 08:58 PM] wbradt#2043
(One swap each)

[20-Nov-18 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
1 order = 1 swap

[20-Nov-18 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
2 orders = 2 swaps

[20-Nov-18 09:02 PM] wbradt#2043
@SHossain But I thought you said "there can be multiple swap per order. that depends on the amount of utxos bob has"

[20-Nov-18 09:02 PM] SHossain#0007
that is for bob.

[20-Nov-18 09:03 PM] wbradt#2043
Oh ok.

[20-Nov-18 09:04 PM] SHossain#0007
bob puts one order using `autoprice` or `setprice` and has multiple utxo. alice can keep swapping their coin that matches with utxo. it can be any number of swaps before bob finishes his sell.

[20-Nov-18 09:08 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, thanks. To clarify, when @jl777c said "there can be multiple proposed swaps for a single request, they would all have the same uuid, but only one can actually happen," what is the "request"?

[20-Nov-18 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
alice posts a buy/sell trade request

[20-Nov-18 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
bob(s) respond

[20-Nov-18 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
alice picks the one she likes best

[20-Nov-18 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
swap starts

[20-Nov-18 09:13 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks. So,  if "alice keeps swapping their coin that matches with" the "best" bob's utxo, is there one or multiple swaps?

[20-Nov-18 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you are not understanding what a swap is...

[20-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is for specific utxo for another specific utxo

[20-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant double spend the same utxo

[20-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
alice can only swap her specific utxo once, with one bob, no more

[20-Nov-18 09:17 PM] wbradt#2043
Sorry, I understand. I was confused because @SHossain said " it can be any number of swaps before bob finishes his sell" but now realize he meant multiple swaps before bob finishes, not multiple swaps before alice finishes

[20-Nov-18 09:19 PM] wbradt#2043
To clarify, if alice places an order, only one swap can result from it?

[20-Nov-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is for specific utxo for another specific utxo
you cant double spend the same utxo
alice can only swap her specific utxo once, with one bob, no more

[20-Nov-18 09:25 PM] wbradt#2043
What is "it"? A swap or an order?

[20-Nov-18 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
both

[20-Nov-18 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
an order from alice specifies the utxo

[20-Nov-18 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
a swap based on the order, uses the same utxi

[20-Nov-18 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you seem to get hung up on some specific words

[20-Nov-18 09:29 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok. So all of bob's swaps are in iguana/DB/SWAPS, right?

[20-Nov-18 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[20-Nov-18 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
same for alice
