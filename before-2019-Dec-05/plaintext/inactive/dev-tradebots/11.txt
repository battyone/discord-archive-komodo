the coins list doesn't show!

[29-Jun-18 06:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it shows on accessing this screen, but then just hides/disappers

[29-Jun-18 06:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna check what's causing it

[29-Jun-18 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The issue is slowness of windows, as always ðŸ˜¦

[29-Jun-18 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
trying to find workaround.

[29-Jun-18 06:56 AM] cipi#4502
lol... windows... what a massive global waste of development manpower

[29-Jun-18 06:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was actually expecting this kinda of issue. and that is why I was asking if any of the testers found any bug or not before merging it to dev ðŸ˜„

[29-Jun-18 07:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the issue is that on html load finishing the javascript code on html side triggers to get the list of `coins` file data which is downloaded from github, so that it can show all those coins' list in the drop down select box, but since it takes more time to reflect the result, the code asynchronously moves to the next part before it gets the results and just executes the code check for `if the returned db data is == 0`

[29-Jun-18 07:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and just executes that part, and then again triggers the next call to re execute and check if the db is having some data or not, and I see it executes it like 20 times before quiting, means getting the expected data output

[29-Jun-18 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thing is I have not put that part in promise code, so that will probably fix it.

[29-Jun-18 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
doing jus that

[29-Jun-18 07:10 AM] jansako#3330
reported that a couple of days ago... the Master branch did not have the issue, the Dev branch had it...  Switched to Master to add a coin, then back to Dev to actually run BarterDex... ðŸ˜ƒ

https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso solves the problem ðŸ˜„

[29-Jun-18 07:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in some sense true, but sadly not entirely.

[29-Jun-18 07:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Jun-18 08:00 AM] Bing#9724
correct I cannot add any coins

[29-Jun-18 08:00 AM] Bing#9724
and it shows *undefined (ABC)* for the coins that should load with my wallet

[29-Jun-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is no ABC coin

[29-Jun-18 08:01 AM] Bing#9724
im just using it as an example

[29-Jun-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you still haven't told what os you are on? or did I missed it?

[29-Jun-18 08:01 AM] Bing#9724
right now BCH EQL LTC are showing up as undefined

[29-Jun-18 08:01 AM] Bing#9724
sorry I stepped away

[29-Jun-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
post a screen shot

[29-Jun-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
your comment still didn't made sense to me as per my tests done replicating your issue.

[29-Jun-18 08:02 AM] Bing#9724
i can't post it

[29-Jun-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thnx

[29-Jun-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh ðŸ˜„

[29-Jun-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Jun-18 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that undefined is valid.

[29-Jun-18 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because the default coins.json file of old installation is not there anymore and the path of the image files and the returned data of new coins.json doesn't has the names and short names, it did not get any output, so it is undefined.

[29-Jun-18 08:04 AM] Bing#9724
ok so how do i fix it?

[29-Jun-18 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
as you'll be able to add the coins on your left panel, the right panel will start loading info fine.

[29-Jun-18 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
wait for my next update

[29-Jun-18 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
after my update you'll be able to see the select drop down list in left panel

[29-Jun-18 08:05 AM] Bing#9724
oh alright! didn't know

[29-Jun-18 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from that list you'll be able to select and add the coins you want to have in your local db.

[29-Jun-18 08:05 AM] Bing#9724
I just thought it was weird because I have balances in those wallets

[29-Jun-18 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
after that your issue will be fixed of as showing undfined etc.

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is a bug that you reported. ðŸ˜‰

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for that

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] Bing#9724
oh shibba!

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but nothing to worry about

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just a listing of coins issue. ðŸ˜„

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] Bing#9724
ok so once that new update comes out

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because of stupid winblows

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] Bing#9724
I will be able to select and my wallet will show up again?

[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's correct.

[29-Jun-18 08:07 AM] Bing#9724
ok cool! Keep up the good work guys ðŸ˜ƒ

[29-Jun-18 08:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@Bing pushed fix for windows issue

[29-Jun-18 09:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you are using git repo to test and try barterdex, use dev branch and get latest updates with `git pull`

[29-Jun-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then start as usual with `npm start`

[29-Jun-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also found one more bug which would have not downloaded images and extra files on fresh install of barterdex, fixed that too in latest commit.

[29-Jun-18 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi @siu - Chainmakers @SHossain FYI

[29-Jun-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now need to test and confirm the ETH outgoing tx...

[29-Jun-18 10:00 AM] SHossain#0007
testing on windows

[29-Jun-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I no confirmation if that is fixed or not

[29-Jun-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
has anyone sent eth from barterdex recently ?

[29-Jun-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
did it work for you?

[29-Jun-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BarterDEX feels more responsive on windows ðŸ¤”

[29-Jun-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be because of fresh install test ðŸ¤”

[29-Jun-18 10:46 AM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder i tried to withdraw ETH using Send button. Didn't show anything and didn't work

[29-Jun-18 10:46 AM] SHossain#0007
using latest

[29-Jun-18 10:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@shantis yes, noticed the same, and talking about it in #deleted-channel

[29-Jun-18 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007
but, adding coins into local db works fine

[29-Jun-18 10:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll need to do some update to eth withdraw in GUI

[29-Jun-18 10:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Jun-18 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007

even though this is my first buy order after login, the GUI throws warning to wait for the previous pending order. recently, i'm seeing this issue. i clicked only once

[29-Jun-18 10:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not sure if it's GUI issue or `marketmaker`

[29-Jun-18 11:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cleared on changes required for ETH withdraw, will work on it. can expect it resolved by next week start.

[29-Jun-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
should we advice users not to use the withdraw funtion for ETH/ERC20 until it is fixed?

[29-Jun-18 11:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes

[29-Jun-18 11:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
be assured that there is no issue if the withdraw fails. It actually is incomplete command issued on eth withdraw, so it never gets broadcasted.

[29-Jun-18 11:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so there is nothing to worry about this bug.

[29-Jun-18 11:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
_I know users freak out on small things ðŸ˜„ _

[29-Jun-18 11:17 AM] SHossain#0007

[29-Jun-18 11:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I hope now coinsdb feature if fixed on all platform

[29-Jun-18 11:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I still expect winblows issue. because it's winblows.
if get any issues on winblows, just let me know.
