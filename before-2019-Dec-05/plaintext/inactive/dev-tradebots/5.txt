this has NOTHING to do with autoprioce

[24-Jun-18 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, noted those in my notes from previous text üòÉ

[24-Jun-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
gtc:1 fill:1 is a good till canceled and filled

[24-Jun-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
gtc:1 fill:0 is good till cancelled or partially filled

[24-Jun-18 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's clear, I just thoguht of just changing the purpose of already showing UI options there to new backend options.
will just add new UI options there.

[24-Jun-18 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
also be careful when testing anything to do with BTC. you are guaranteed to get a 30 minute delay in blocks

[24-Jun-18 02:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@artem.pikulin can see win mm link there. hoping osx are compiling too? ü§î

[24-Jun-18 02:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c got it. thanks for warning üòâ

[24-Jun-18 02:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I however want to buy bit more BTC for KMD from you üôÇ

[24-Jun-18 02:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
obviously using BarterDEX

[24-Jun-18 02:21 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
It takes time to build Linux and Mac versions after windows is done.

[24-Jun-18 02:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay üëç I'll just code the UI part until then

[24-Jun-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I didnt implement support for ETH stuff with the latest

[24-Jun-18 02:22 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Appveyor tags a build and then Travis builds other versions.

[24-Jun-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so not sure if they will have any effect. maybe some parts of it will work

[24-Jun-18 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just confirming, the artem's builds have the fill/gtc in it, right ?

[24-Jun-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think bob will do autoutxo creation, but it probably doesnt matter

[24-Jun-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
for ETH as 1 ETOMIC is the size for all

[24-Jun-18 02:23 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, I merged everything from jl777 dev branch, however it might not work properly for ETH/ERC20, needs to be tested.

[24-Jun-18 02:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
great! thanks for confirming. can see both osx and linux bins there too. üôÇ

[24-Jun-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i know the LP_autofillbob() wont do anything for etomic coins

[24-Jun-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but it likely doesnt have to

[24-Jun-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
as they dont have utxo to begin with

[24-Jun-18 02:29 PM] cipi#4502
@grewalsatinder the build from artem is done... should i upload it to coinsdb-branch of BarterDEX-GUI?

[24-Jun-18 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes plz

[24-Jun-18 02:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also since nobody has done it, you guys think it's OK to merge the coinsdb changes to dev now?

[24-Jun-18 02:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers @SHossain @cipi ?

[24-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> I think its ready

[24-Jun-18 02:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, merging then.

[24-Jun-18 02:34 PM] SHossain#0007
I have tested as well coinsdb branch and didn't find any issue. Couldn't test in the last few days as I was in the Komodo Meetup. Going back home now.

[24-Jun-18 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain nice to hear mate.
merged coinsdb branch to dev branch.

[24-Jun-18 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Please avoid coinsdb branch from now on.
I'll continue pushing code to dev.

[24-Jun-18 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi @siu - Chainmakers FYI

[24-Jun-18 02:35 PM] SHossain#0007
üëå

[24-Jun-18 02:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also we are now using version number `1.1.x` since coinsdb is major feature. üôÇ

I'll write some release notes for you when you make a release of it.

[24-Jun-18 02:37 PM] cipi#4502
i just updated the mm binaries of mm to v1.0.270, but in coinsdb branch... 2 commits, since if first forgot to do windows too

[24-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Awesome

[24-Jun-18 02:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks @cipi noticed those, I see those are merged to dev along with other things in dev from coinsdb branch.

[24-Jun-18 02:38 PM] cipi#4502
windows binaries are missing in dev... should i upload the windows mm to dev, or do you just merge them from coinsdb?

[24-Jun-18 02:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi If you can do, please update the ReadMe file for jl777/coins 
because from now on any new coin add requests has to ONLY go in that repo.

[24-Jun-18 02:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and for that anyone who'll push the add request has to have all the requirements completed and make sure the format is accurate .

[24-Jun-18 02:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
else coinsdb feature may disrupt all clients if something goes wrong ü§î

[24-Jun-18 02:40 PM] cipi#4502
which readme do you mean? that one https://github.com/cipig/coins/blob/master/README.md does not contain much info...

@artem.pikulin do you have a windows10 system to test with? I keep hearing there are SPV problems with windows. If you can duplicate this issue, maybe we can get it fixed?

[24-Jun-18 02:43 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, I have win 10 as secondary OS, are there any steps to reproduce an issue?

[24-Jun-18 02:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No particular steps

[24-Jun-18 02:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Just try a swap in windowa the issue should be visible every so often

[24-Jun-18 02:47 PM] cipi#4502
@grewalsatinder committed the missing Windows-mm to dev... everything ok now

[24-Jun-18 02:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool üëç

[24-Jun-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
There is 1 slight issue with the auto-retry (for lack of better term) in the new code: the timer interferes with other market orders

[24-Jun-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
i.e., if you gtc SUPERNET/KMD and try to place CoinX/CoinY, the new order can meet against "please wait x seconds..." (even if it's been minutes since 1st order)

[24-Jun-18 03:23 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@siu what kind of issue should I expect with SPV mode on win 10? I need more details.

[24-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> you will get a "swap never started error"

[24-Jun-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie yes, not sure what to do about that. really i should support an arbitrary number of parallel trades for alice, but I cant fully vizualize all the code paths in that scenario so I am reluctant to do it. on the plus side, you can  have many gtc orders and it will try to cycle through. i guess there is a starvation bug though, let me fix that

[24-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> swap itself will get stuck, mostly at waiting for alice payment

[24-Jun-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> i need to add gtc=1 in client script ?

[24-Jun-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
in buy/sell script

[24-Jun-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> ok

[24-Jun-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jl777c It's not entirely a "bad" thing; just wanted folks to be aware as I think there should be something to let users know that this happens and is "by design" (rather than getting a flood of "this shit doesn't work anymore")

[24-Jun-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
A simple warning can go a long way in fighting confusion-based FUD

[24-Jun-18 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
op err generally being seen as bugs and all that

[24-Jun-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
mixing modes will be the only way to run into this, but yes it is a confusion issue

[24-Jun-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that should be pretty resistant to starving any specific gtc order, ie. they should mostly get the same number of attempts

{Reactions}
üëç 

[24-Jun-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
@artem.pikulin my guess is windows is getting some sort of error that isnt being handled because none of the unix based sockets behave that way. MSFT spent billions of dollars making windows work the same, just different to lock in people to their apps (which were the only ones that knew how to work around all the silliness as it isnt really documented)

thinking about adding a feature of autoupdating `marketmaker` ü§î

[24-Jun-18 04:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if done, that will look for releases on github repo, exactly like right now artem releases those on his git repo.

[24-Jun-18 04:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll code to check github api for a repo to check for new version of marketmaker.

[24-Jun-18 04:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that will eliminate releasing a new barterdex release just for updated marketmaker.

[24-Jun-18 04:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but then again, I need the tags which can be helpful.

[24-Jun-18 04:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like if it's stable, or nightly or experimental etc.

[24-Jun-18 04:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
