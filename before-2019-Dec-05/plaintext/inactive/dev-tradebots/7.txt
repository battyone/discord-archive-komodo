Judging from amounts, it almost seems as if a partial fill alice turned into a bob for the remainder

how far did that trade progress?

Hi, Is it normal for many of these messages in terminal when using BarterDEX-cli?

@ComputerGenie ok, I think I really fixed the spontaneaous bob issue. internally now there are separate sets of prices for alice vs bob, so if you are not doing bob things like autoprice there wont be any bob price to ordermatch

[25-Jun-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
before there was a single set of prices so if you did an alice order, it ended up with a bob price for the reverse for a short period of time and if an incoming alice request came in, it could have started the ordermatch process. But I think it would not have completed as there wasnt a pending alice order i that direction.

[25-Jun-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
now it wont even start

added persistence to gtc orders, but it is untested. if it works or doesnt, let me know. basically it will restore any pending GTC order, but it is quite inefficient for now if you have a lot of orders

if it expired, getting expired message is fine

[25-Jun-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC/KMD ignore as qprice 3797.24912360 vs myprice 3885.11223442

[25-Jun-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
bob ignored it as the price was too low

[25-Jun-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so it expired

[25-Jun-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
this is expected behavior

[25-Jun-18 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
to "fix" this would require forcing bob to accept whatever price alice offers and while alice would be quite happy to have all her orders filled (regardless of price) it is possible some bobs will complain

[25-Jun-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
i increased it to 4000. now received a quote

[25-Jun-18 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
anyone know what the fix is for the BarterDEX GUI when it imports the coinsdb list but not the images?

[25-Jun-18 11:37 AM] SHossain#0007
restart BarterDEX GUI

[25-Jun-18 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
that should fix it. after adding any new coins using the manage coin function, you need to restart the GUI for the changes to take effect

[25-Jun-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I tried that 4 or 5 times, it didn't dl any of the icons

[25-Jun-18 11:40 AM] SHossain#0007
which coins are missing?

[25-Jun-18 11:41 AM] SHossain#0007
might as well try restarting your computer

[25-Jun-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
pretty much all of them are gone and restarting is not an option

[25-Jun-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
using dev branch, btw

[25-Jun-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
strange! i don't see this issue in Ubuntu

[25-Jun-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
just tested

[25-Jun-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm going to dump and try clean, may be an issue updating from 1.06 to 1.1

[25-Jun-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <shossain:matrix.org> i also used `git reset --hard` then updated and used my locally built fresh mm. testing the gtc and fill orders.

[25-Jun-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
also, anyone know where the db read timer is? the console output is making me dizzy

[25-Jun-18 12:45 PM] cipi#4502
removing ~/.BarterDEX and restarting might help

[25-Jun-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
That made it worse, although deling CoinsDB did get etomic this time

[25-Jun-18 12:54 PM] cipi#4502
there is also a reset coinsdb-button somewhere  on the coins-management page...

[25-Jun-18 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ya, I found that and it works if I add each manually, but I couldn't get it to add all (I think it just hates me)

[25-Jun-18 01:01 PM] cipi#4502
all? you mean all coins? that will not work since there are more then 255 coins and the limit is 255... that is why all this was made, to prevent having more then 255 coins in the coins-file

[25-Jun-18 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"all" meaning any default set larger than just KMD, BTC, and etomic

[25-Jun-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or is that the intention (just 3 and manually add anything else)?

[25-Jun-18 01:03 PM] cipi#4502
yes, there is a default collection, i think it is BTC, KMD and ETOMIC and every other coin must be added manually to your collection... and you have to restart BarterDEX after adding coins

[25-Jun-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
fek me, I shoulda backed up my folder before doing a pull 😭

[25-Jun-18 01:06 PM] cipi#4502
and when you add coins with the coins-management-page they are only added to coins.json and the icons and stuff is downloaded... you will have to also enable them as usualk after restarting BarterDEX

[25-Jun-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
So, we took a nice, ordered list (that was conveniently separated into 3 categories) and turned it into an alphabetical free-for-all guessing game 😣

[25-Jun-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_goes to grab a coffee and start working on his stratum_

[25-Jun-18 01:31 PM] CHMEX#0686
is it technically necessary for the orderbook to have the corresponding coin enabled? (does it scan the chain for certain info) or would it be possible to show the orderbooks even the coin is not enabled (like it's now possible for price without an enabled coin)

[25-Jun-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible

[25-Jun-18 01:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
that would be great than I could than give blocfolio all orderbooks currently it would be limited to the the ones with electrum support

[25-Jun-18 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
its there in jl777

[25-Jun-18 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
plz test, as i didnt have time to test it

[25-Jun-18 01:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
wow thanks you program faster than I type here 
I will test it

[25-Jun-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it took me twice as long as I had a pending syntax error from a different code

[25-Jun-18 01:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
😂 always a joy

[25-Jun-18 01:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
we should have video tutorial of coinsdb feature to clear on it's needs and how to use it.

[25-Jun-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, if you need a video tutorial in order to explain a required basic component, then'it's likely too complex

[25-Jun-18 01:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's all I could do.

[25-Jun-18 01:49 PM] cipi#4502
i don't think it is too complex... it is a tool for editing configs and after you edit a config you have to restart the application for the changes to take effect... that's all... it is not a mars rocket 😄

[25-Jun-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's ya'll's boat; I'm just along for the ride

[25-Jun-18 02:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
orderbooks without enabled coin works thanks

[25-Jun-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it was a lot of work, but worth it!

[25-Jun-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i might have broken the CHIPS, it seems the miners dont like the tx in the mempool

[25-Jun-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, I mean it was found after I fired the stratum up; my miners hadn't even come off the failover yet 😦

[25-Jun-18 02:17 PM] CHMEX#0686
ow I see

[25-Jun-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully the diff will come back down to where CPU mining can be done again

[25-Jun-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a long way to go before it gets there

[25-Jun-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed initial version of mpnet support. this should make the networking nearly 100% reliable, even in windows, at least to the point where the ordermatch is done. I dont have mpnet active for the actual canbind:1 direct comms yet, wanted to make sure the basics work first

[25-Jun-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody is curious how this can be possible?

[25-Jun-18 04:33 PM] allbits#5898

i use CHIPS mempool as the network, mempool network mpnet

[25-Jun-18 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it also goes into the blocks so we can see the gtc orders that are  recently placed

[25-Jun-18 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you just need to have CHIPS enabled and some small amounts

[25-Jun-18 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so even for win10, if it can sync CHIPS, it will get a reliable connection

[25-Jun-18 04:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for any other trading pair that is not chips?

[25-Jun-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, CHIPS is just the network

[25-Jun-18 04:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so to have more reliable mm on win10 user should have CHIPS enabled in any mode?

[25-Jun-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i only tested native, but for alice SPV might be enough

[25-Jun-18 04:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so do I get this correct that barterdex p2p netwok which is individual, is now either partially dependent or more dependent on CHIPS's p2p network in case if it's windows ?

[25-Jun-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it acts as a backup comm link

[25-Jun-18 04:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay 👍

[25-Jun-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and any OS can use this

[25-Jun-18 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
even without any CHIPS if it is enabled you can see the packets from the other nodes

[25-Jun-18 04:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nice! 🙂

[25-Jun-18 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
I have seen occasional lost packets via nanomsg and this will fix those cases, i think the ordermatch will have almost no networking issues after this is debugged

[25-Jun-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it will print MPNET.(json ) if it gets a CHIPS packet

[25-Jun-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and you will see an opreturn withdraw when you send normal ordermatch packets (if CHIPS enabled and funded)

[25-Jun-18 04:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
any recommendations for BarterDEX GUI if I should have CHIPS autoenabled like KMD/BTC/ETOMIC in app ?

[25-Jun-18 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is in the system, probably a good idea to enable it

[25-Jun-18 04:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay will add that there in default coins list.

[25-Jun-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if SPV it shouldnt be automatic though

[25-Jun-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it could slow things down, not sure

[25-Jun-18 04:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
clear
then I'll have it added to default coins list which shows on first startup like on fresh install and let user decide which mode they want to have it setup to autoenable it to.
