Yep, thats the error

[26-Jun-18 04:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers pushed fixes to dev branch

[26-Jun-18 04:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
tested on windows 10

[26-Jun-18 04:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
deleted barterdex data dir and started it like fresh install, loads fine in my tests

[26-Jun-18 04:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, thanks. Will work on releasing again now

[26-Jun-18 05:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi @siu - Chainmakers @SHossain I reseted the default coins.json in the dev branch.

[26-Jun-18 05:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers please test latest dev branch

[26-Jun-18 05:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
fresh install

[26-Jun-18 05:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
on linux

[26-Jun-18 05:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it was the method difference between windows and linux for coins.json which was bit issue

[26-Jun-18 05:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so without breaking too much of existing code the simpler way was to just make the coins.json file default to what it is expected by coinsdb feature.

[26-Jun-18 05:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
from this commit on all coins db info is now only in jl777/coins repo.

[26-Jun-18 05:19 PM] cipi#4502
@jl777c the call "blockchain.transaction.get" now has an additional parameter, verbose (boolean) and mm doesn't pass it, which causes some error messages... could you add that parameter to the call? Here is the docu: https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/blob/master/docs/protocol-methods.rst#blockchaintransactionget ... question is also which format does mm needs, the raw, hex transaction, or the nice json one...

[26-Jun-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
will all electrums support verbose?

[26-Jun-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 branch adds this now

[26-Jun-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know if it works

[26-Jun-18 05:30 PM] cipi#4502
hmmm, that is a good question, the ones i run myself will certainly support it, but the public ones that we also use may still have some older version running... hmmm, not sure what is the best way to deal with that

[26-Jun-18 05:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi  best would be to have the contact info included in the JSON of Electrum server info.

[26-Jun-18 05:33 PM] cipi#4502
the dev of electrumx-server has made a code change to get rid of the error, i will have to restart all electrums to see if it solved the problem... i have no other option, since all electrum-servers are logging to the same /var/log/syslog file

[26-Jun-18 05:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like 
[{"electrum2.cipig.net":10001,"contact":"email@example.com"},{"electrum1.cipig.net":10001,"contact":"email@example.com"}]

[26-Jun-18 05:34 PM] cipi#4502
@grewalsatinder sure, i can do that... hopefully it will not brake the other applications (HyperDEX and Agama)... and i can only add that info to the servers i run, the public ones will remain without that info

[26-Jun-18 05:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
adding another key to these objects should not break things...

[26-Jun-18 05:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me just test it. just a sec

[26-Jun-18 05:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, works as expected. no issues

[26-Jun-18 05:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only updated KMD file with this:
`[{"electrum2.cipig.net":10001,"contact":"email@example.com"},{"electrum1.cipig.net":10001,"contact":"email@example.com"}]`

[26-Jun-18 05:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
did no change to barterdex code and it added the electrum servers fine

[26-Jun-18 05:40 PM] cipi#4502
ok... will add that info after dealing with the electrums servers themselves... what is this info used for?

[26-Jun-18 05:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that is in case you or anyone have to contact the electrum server owners

[26-Jun-18 05:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just like now is the case to update the electrum servers

[26-Jun-18 05:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there should be a method to contact them

[26-Jun-18 05:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
any way possible, bitmessage, twitter, skype, email, etc etc.

[26-Jun-18 05:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can also make this contact  key another array or object

[26-Jun-18 05:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
```[
  {
    "electrum2.cipig.net": 10001,
    "contact": [
      {
        "email": "email@example.com"

[26-Jun-18 05:44 PM] cipi#4502
i am here in discord and in matrix anyway, and if i am not here, sending emails will not change anything, means i am either dead or not online 😃

[26-Jun-18 05:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's not just for you

[26-Jun-18 05:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's a format to be followed by any coin who will come and add it to barterdex list

[26-Jun-18 05:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just gave example of adding contact info

[26-Jun-18 05:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[26-Jun-18 05:51 PM] cipi#4502
you are right... and there is indeed the need for it... had contact with some people who set up their own electrums (eg BCBC) and  i have to admit that i already forgot their contact info... sleep well and thanks for your efforts

[slack] <siu> i still get the same error in dev branch fresh install on linux

[26-Jun-18 08:10 PM] cipi#4502
and.... we have a new problem: ca's electrum workaround does not work any more, means the electrum server disconnects clients after 10 `failed blockchain.transaction.get KMD` again... today is not my day... at least Argentina made it 😃

[26-Jun-18 08:16 PM] cipi#4502
ok, i see the problem... when i ask the server about a non existent tx `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "error": {"code": 2, "message": "daemon error: {'code': -1, 'message': 'JSON value is not an integer as expected'}"}, "id": 1}` is returned instead of the error string "not found"... will play a bit with it, maybe i can "fix" it myself... but it would of course be better if this workaround would not be necessary, since changes in the code can break it

[26-Jun-18 09:18 PM] cipi#4502
found the issue... the fix made by the electrumx-dev fixed an error, but broke `blockchain.transaction.get`

[26-Jun-18 09:19 PM] cipi#4502
`komodo-cli getrawtransaction "9fab67666ec927263b3e776320bbc0b6f71ddfceabb434d938012a3cc072e99d"` shows me the rawtransaction

[26-Jun-18 09:19 PM] cipi#4502
but `(echo '{ "id": 1, "method": "blockchain.transaction.get", "params": ["9fab67666ec927263b3e776320bbc0b6f71ddfceabb434d938012a3cc072e99d"] }'; sleep 0.5) | ncat electrum2.cipig.net 10001` shows only an error `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "error": {"code": 2, "message": "daemon error: {'code': -1, 'message': 'JSON value is not an integer as expected'}"}, "id": 1}`

[26-Jun-18 09:25 PM] cipi#4502
i try to revert everything to a version before the "fix"... but i have to restart all 45 electrum-instances

[26-Jun-18 09:26 PM] cipi#4502
ok, reverting worked... restarted KMD electrum and it works again

[26-Jun-18 09:26 PM] cipi#4502

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> It wont break current marketmaker to revert that change?

[26-Jun-18 09:29 PM] cipi#4502
no, the "fix" was because of an error i spotted in the logs... but the error didn't seem to affect operation...

[26-Jun-18 09:31 PM] cipi#4502
next time i spot an error, i better keep my mouth shut and don't complain any more 😃

`slowresponse.2`does not look very good, seems bob is not doing very well

[26-Jun-18 10:10 PM] cipi#4502
had a couple of such bobs, look especially at SUPERNET and CHIPS... the cheap bobs for this coins are doing the same... and the symptoms are the same... that's why i asked if we could penalize such bobs more and simply remove them from the orderbook

[26-Jun-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> but why do bobs get into that state?

[26-Jun-18 10:14 PM] cipi#4502
that is a good question... asked myself the same question... maybe that are simply very old installations that are still running, but where nobody really takes care of this bobs... but i don't know, i just speculate

and if that is indeed the case, then removing them from orderbook is the best option, because i suppose that more people are running into the same problem
