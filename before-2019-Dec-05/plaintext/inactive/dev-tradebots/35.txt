@jl777c But with old protocol if nobody puts up the liquidity no fees would be paid still. Maybe I didn't understand something correct? Do we consider the fee as something that affects liquidity?

[14-Dec-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the 200%+ affected liquidity the most

[14-Dec-18 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the concern is that without any dexfee at stake, what incentive does bob side have for completing a swap, especially the refund cases

[14-Dec-18 03:33 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The bob could not send deposit after Afee, there was no incentive for him to do it if he's malicious and just wants the Alice to spend some funds and time for useless swap.

[14-Dec-18 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. but now we need to make sure that at every step in all other cases, bob has incentive to complete the next step

[14-Dec-18 03:40 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Maybe I miss something but nothing really changes, there is always a case that someone loses the fee if other side doesn't follow the protocol. I think the "incentive" to complete the trade is somewhere outside the atomic swap protocol: e.g. Bob wants to buy some beer for KMD, but beerstore accepts only ETH so Bob opens HyperDEX and puts the order to exchange his KMD to ETH.

[14-Dec-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we eliminate a lot of the deposits coming back cases, without the deposits

[14-Dec-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and once the first spend using secret is done, the trade is done other than the other side doing their half, which they are fully motivated to do

[14-Dec-18 03:47 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
1 side always have to start the swap, let's compare a couple of cases:
1. Alice doesn't send the fee - swap is aborted (both versions). There is no incentive that might force the malicious Alice to send the fee.
2. Alice sends fee - but then Bob doesn't send the deposit (old version) or payment (new version) - actually nothing changed. Alice loses fee in both cases. There is no incentive that might force the malicious Bob to send deposit/payment.

[14-Dec-18 03:49 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The only incentive might be reputation system: nobody will soon trade with malicious keypair owner, however it's not hard to generate a new one and keep cheating.

[14-Dec-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Bob opens HyperDEX and puts the order to exchange his KMD to ETH.`
And if Bob lives in a rural area Bob gets his beer 3 weeks later...

[14-Dec-18 03:52 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Wanna increase KMD blocktime to 3 weeks to make it real?)

[14-Dec-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
block times have no impact on how well SPV interaction does/doesn't work for a large percentage of the population

[14-Dec-18 04:04 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The other important thing to mention: we want to eliminate the difference between liquidity provider and taker (like it is on centralized exchanges). So the user downloads the app, puts an order and might just wait until someone comes to take it. Of course he needs his app to be running until trade completes, but imagine this on mobile devices: these are actually always on so (maybe, I'm not sure about the background apps limitations on mobile OS) in ideal situation he puts an order on his phone and goes to sleep like he can do with centralized exchange.

Can bob put the fee at first, then during the swap Alice repays the fee @artem.pikulin ?

[15-Dec-18 02:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If Bob went first then Bob would be Alice; because A B C...

[15-Dec-18 10:19 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Mylo Hi, could you please describe in more details the idea of `Alice repays the fee`? It's mentioned as `benefit` at wiki that Liquidity provider doesn't need to pay the fee: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/Be-a-marketmaker-or-bob-using-barterDEX-CLI#benefits-of-being-an-lp-node.

[16-Dec-18 01:47 AM] Mylo#8306
@artem.pikulin let me try. 
Currently Alice pays dexfee in v1.  Bob puts a deposit.  To deter spammy traders.

Reading how you are trying to remove the Alice and bob -ness of a trade, and to remove the need for bob to have extra deposit.  Yes benefit of no fee to LP is there in v1 but requiring extra deposit exists.

Instead, bob puts order with dexfee paid.  When Alice comes to buy bobs order, Alice pays dexfee back to bob from Alice funds during trade.  Bob still has no fee trade, Alice still pays dexfee, bob doesn’t need deposit.

Bob 10xdexfee
Alice trade
Bob trade
Alice dexfee
Bob refund10xdexfee

OR
Bob dexfee
Bob trade
Alice trade+repaydexfee

Or some other combination where one party cannot inconvenience the other by canceling mid trade.

Maybe zeroconf deposits can be used by LP for dexfee in the protocol refactor?

[17-Dec-18 04:44 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Mylo Hi, the main purpose of previous protocol was to allow the swap of coins that do not support CLTV opcode as there were just few of them at the moment of discussion. I might be wrong but there is `always` a way for one of the parties to not follow the protocol making other side loosing the fee (or there might be the case that fee is not collected), examples:
Bob 10xdexfee -> Alice trade -> Bob trade -> There is no incentive for Alice to send the dexfee as Bpayment is already done and she can spend it.
Bob dexfee -> Bob trade -> Alice trade + repaydexfee -> Bob doesn't spend the Alice payment, both sides refund the payments after locktime passes, but fee is lost.
`Maybe zeroconf deposits can be used by LP for dexfee in the protocol refactor?` - the goal of protocol refactor is to eliminate the requirement to have much more funds that is really required to trade (212% for bob). We should start to think very different about it, just imagine centralized exchange that forces you to make `2xdeposit` to trade, I guess nobody will use it. Or the exchange where you need run app in CLI-mode on dedicated server to be liquidity provider.
Any additional deposits will confuse the end users (remember that we present HyperDEX as "grandma" friendly). Users shouldn't have a questions like "why do I need to put the additional deposit to start the trade?", because it's irritating them. If we irritate the user there is more chance that he closes the app and never comes back making the DEX platform using the liquidity.

[17-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks @artem.pikulin so it’s a balancing act of usability and losing fee scenarios.  It’s nice to read the github comments and continuing development thoughts and goals 😃

[17-Dec-18 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`remember that we present HyperDEX as "grandma" friendly`
And one iteration of one GUI is now the base concept for the protocol? The new thought is that grandma is going to be a liquidity provider?

[17-Dec-18 10:41 PM] tolken#2655
I believe in gramma, just give her the tools. Imagine a million grammas providing liquidity, with not a single technical support issue/ticket opened. We’d be unstoppable.

[17-Dec-18 11:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol @tolken 
the point I was getting at was that I'm all for making the protocol simpler because it needs to be simpler; making the protocol simpler because gradma's simpler GUI needs it to be simpler, not so much

[18-Dec-18 07:11 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Actually yes, it's a kind of recursion, we want to make things simpler just to make some other things simpler:
1. Makes users life simpler - they don't need to understand why they need the 212% to trade.
2. Makes programmer life simpler - less steps are easier to code, the less code you have less errors you have in it.
Main motivation was to remove the 212% stuff. One of the MM2 essential goals is `UX similar to centralized exchange`. Did you see any CEX that requires you to deposit 212KMD to trade just 100?

[18-Dec-18 07:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@artem.pikulin You seem to still be missing my point, so I'll try to be more blunt...
There should be no mention of HyperDEX as it pertains to the protocol level of mm/barterdex, unless HyperDEX is the official GUI for the protocol.

[18-Dec-18 07:38 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It was just one of arguments, and yes the idea is actually `new thought is that grandma is going to be a liquidity provider?` because `anyone` that uses DEX should be able to act as LP, not just IT experienced person that has VPS with public IP.

[18-Dec-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
with the torrent networking it would be possible

[20-Dec-18 08:17 PM] wbradt#2043

[21-Dec-18 08:39 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jorian Please ensure that you either use latest `jl777/dev` or `artemii235/master` build, this error indicates that coin has Sapling activated but MM doesn't recognize it. The latest version have hardcoded Sapling support for KMD and all assetchains, if it's outdated "a bit" you might have to explicitly set `"txversion":4` in coins config. But config txversion won't help if you use too old version.

[21-Dec-18 08:41 AM] jorian#4555

[21-Dec-18 08:46 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The Sapling support was implemented about 2 months ago and was tested at least by me on ZEC testnet. There are not many users as I can see, but according to https://dexstats.info/ few swaps are happening every day.

@Deleted User I see that on November 23th you had the error `fatal error: /usr/local/include/nanomsg/nn.h: No such file or directory` while building/updating the SuperNET repo. What was your solution to this?

Background information: I try to update the SuperNET repo after a pull. I use `cd SuperNET && ./m_unix`. I get the nn.h error above.

[24-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
It was for kmdlabs. As the install is different is was mainly because I did all manually

[24-Dec-18 01:57 PM] bartwr#6773
Ok. Will update my solution here as soon as I have it. Presumably installing libnanomsg-dev solves it

_For future reference_ // While updating the SuperNET repo using `./m_unix` I got ` fatal error: /usr/local/include/nanomsg/nn.h: No such file or directory`.

I could solve the error by doing this:

$ whereis nanomsg
nanomsg: /usr/include/nanomsg

$ ls /usr/local/include/nanomsg
