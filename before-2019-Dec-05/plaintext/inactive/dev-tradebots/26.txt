it is getting to connect?

[17-Aug-18 09:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
no

[17-Aug-18 09:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
sometimes it gets to reserved

[17-Aug-18 09:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
but then restarts

[17-Aug-18 09:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think if I leave it long enough it will eventually get to connnected

[17-Aug-18 09:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's what happened the other day

[17-Aug-18 09:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
these are the logs from Bob's end:

[17-Aug-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i pushed an experimental 10 minute between gtc, it might increase the chance a lot

[17-Aug-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can try that one and let me know if it works better, I can propagate it

[17-Aug-18 09:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
does that shed any light on the issue ☝

[17-Aug-18 09:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
I get those block repeatedly

[17-Aug-18 09:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
the `alice not eligible` looks suspect

[17-Aug-18 09:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
or maybe it's just the 5 min timer cancelling from alice's end before bob gets round to connecting

[17-Aug-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems pretty clear what is wrong:
alice not eligible 1.01415185 -> dest 0.10510000 0.10363340 (0.21976058 0.00096454) cd467afd9d7eb999bef00ebc019195566ca45a3ed3c3bfa3aee62777badf8ba2/v1 ca2952004522324bef4cdb83f2e2e3d1eb47d968c91b196ba275fd02e5bb1406/v1
quote MYTH/KMD validate error -3

[17-Aug-18 09:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
what does that mean?

[17-Aug-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
bob thinks either: cd467afd9d7eb999bef00ebc019195566ca45a3ed3c3bfa3aee62777badf8ba2/v1 ca2952004522324bef4cdb83f2e2e3d1eb47d968c91b196ba275fd02e5bb1406/v1
is already spent

[17-Aug-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is, then it is an alice problem. if not, then a bob problem

[17-Aug-18 09:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
they definitely exist from alices side

[17-Aug-18 09:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
```

[17-Aug-18 09:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
will check on a block explorer

[17-Aug-18 09:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
what's the komod block explorer api slug?

[17-Aug-18 09:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's not the normal `/api` one is it?

[17-Aug-18 09:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it's custom

[17-Aug-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
got it

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's https://kmdexplorer.io/insight-api-komodo

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
block explorer thinks my UTXOs exist too

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks @CHMEX , a little too slow 😉

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
Hehe

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
then it could be the reservation time, the 10 minutes should help

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, will test with that as soon as artems build is published

[17-Aug-18 09:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
what do you mean by reservation time btw?

[17-Aug-18 09:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
like that UTXO is broadcast to the network as being in use for that trade?

[17-Aug-18 09:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
so when the next gtc order fires if it uses the same UTXO it might still be signalled as being in use so nodes won't trust it?

[17-Aug-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
correct

[17-Aug-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i only put the 10 minute delay in jl777, do you want me to propagate it to artems?

[17-Aug-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
yes please

[17-Aug-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
but before you do that

[17-Aug-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
just an idea

[17-Aug-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
could you not tie the reservation time UTXO to the order id?

[17-Aug-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
so that UTXO is only reserved to that id

[17-Aug-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
so if a bob sees a gtc order

[17-Aug-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
which shares the same id

[17-Aug-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
it will still be able to use the UTXO

[17-Aug-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is that not how it works?

[17-Aug-18 09:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
does it select a new UTXO for each gtc re-order?

[17-Aug-18 09:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
lock the UTXO and re-use it for each gtc re-order?

[17-Aug-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that will require entirely new logic.. of course it is a good idea, but I am somewhat distant from that codebase now and likely I will make it worse without diving back into it fully

[17-Aug-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
build is triggered in artem's repo

[17-Aug-18 09:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok no worries

[17-Aug-18 09:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
if the 10 min repeat fixes it then that should be fine for now

[17-Aug-18 09:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
can talk about other options with mmv2 team

[17-Aug-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
how long is the reservation time btw?

[17-Aug-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on SPV or no SPV, but could be as long as 5 minutes

[17-Aug-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
new build is there

[17-Aug-18 09:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
awesome thanks

[17-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
still doesn't seem to be working

[17-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
left it for almost an hour

[17-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
been watching the logs

[17-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
the Bob sees every re-order

[17-Aug-18 01:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
and does some stuff

[17-Aug-18 01:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
but never connects

[17-Aug-18 01:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
here are the iguana logs with timestamps grepped for MYTH (trade is MYTH/KMD) so you can see the different orders

it just repeats that over and over

[17-Aug-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
does alice see the reserved?

[17-Aug-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
what is MYTH?

[17-Aug-18 01:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
A test currency I'm using

[17-Aug-18 01:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
to make sure no one else uses it

[17-Aug-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is not ERC20

[17-Aug-18 01:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
it is ERC20

[17-Aug-18 01:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
we don't get any more `alice not eligible` since you made the latest change

[17-Aug-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe try a non-ERC20 for this first?

[17-Aug-18 01:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
And yes, Alice gets all the reserved messages

[17-Aug-18 01:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok, will try non ERC20

[17-Aug-18 01:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
from alice end in HyperDEX console:

```
swap._debug.messages.map(m => m.method)
(16) ["request", "request", "request", "request", "request", "request", "request", "reserved", "request", "request", "reserved", "request", "request", "request", "request", "reserved"]
```

[17-Aug-18 01:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
those are all the websocket messages

[17-Aug-18 01:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think the issue is related to ERC20 btw

[17-Aug-18 01:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
the swap works if it gets matched on the first request

[17-Aug-18 01:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
If a place a gtc order that I know won't be matched instantly

[17-Aug-18 01:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
THEN create a matchable offer on my Bob

[17-Aug-18 01:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
it will never match the future re-orders

[17-Aug-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
I will need to set this up tomorrow and see if I can duplicate this

[17-Aug-18 01:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[17-Aug-18 01:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
just set up a bob without any orders

[17-Aug-18 01:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
place an order on an alice in an empty order book

[17-Aug-18 01:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
so you can see the order on your bob

[17-Aug-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
THEN set the corresponding order on your Bob

[17-Aug-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
alice will see it

[17-Aug-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
bob will send reserve messages each time he sees a request

[17-Aug-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it doesn't seem to match

[17-Aug-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
although the other day I left it running for a very long time and seemed to eventually match

[17-Aug-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it is definitely not working properly

[17-Aug-18 01:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
because if the Bob order exists before you place the alice order they match almost instantly
