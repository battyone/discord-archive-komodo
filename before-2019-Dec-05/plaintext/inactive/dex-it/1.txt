The atomicDEX mobile beta program successfully launched on iOS and android and you can now join us in #atomicdex-beta - We want to celebrate this big release with the first part of a special DEX campaign. Post a fancy atomicDEX mobile photo of you or trading screenshot and we will randomly tip you some KMD out of a 777 KMD pot - use one from the below scenarios:

a) Tweet a photo of yourself with atomicDEX mobile running on your phone (showing your KMD QR code - or post the KMD address in a 2nd tweet-comment)  from a cool location 
b) Tweet a screenshot of a successful atomicDEX mobile RICK/MORTY swap and one with your KMD address QR code (from within atomicDEX mobile) - add some info ref. your experience to the tweet
c) Tweet a video of you using atomicDEX mobile (the coolest video gets on our official channels and blogs)

Please use hashtags #dex-it #atomicdex #DEX and tag us in the tweets (@komodoplatform) - share your tweets in the #talk-general and #dex-it channels. Happy beta!

It is good to do the atomic swaps on the mobile, but i think we need a plan to pull in other communities. Should we get a list of top 20 that we can trade KMD with?

[17-Jul-19 12:14 PM] Malti#3948
@ca333  might be easier to pin this message as it doesn't jump you to another channel

@hyperDEX yes i agree - we need to pull in some other communities as that will increase the campaign participations.

[17-Jul-19 12:18 PM] Malti#3948
i got a pinned message in KMD discord (that I didn't write myself tho..) so proud üòÑ

[17-Jul-19 12:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@ca333 lets start at least with pirate/kmd and verus kmd

[17-Jul-19 12:18 PM] SHossain#0007
PIRATE?

[17-Jul-19 12:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
arrr/kmd

[17-Jul-19 12:19 PM] ca333#0118
pirate is not fully supported yet in the app - but coming in the near future

[17-Jul-19 12:20 PM] ca333#0118
however, maybe their community would still join such a campaign.

[17-Jul-19 12:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
sorry my bad i mean verus for now

[17-Jul-19 12:21 PM] Malti#3948

yes i mean to get people using it to trade instead of DP

[17-Jul-19 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to involve community, yes a good idea

[17-Jul-19 12:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
DP wallet is down so it is a good option and real users

[17-Jul-19 12:24 PM] Malti#3948
DGB has a huge and good community as well

[17-Jul-19 12:24 PM] Malti#3948
+ the coin is already active on atomicDEX

[17-Jul-19 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
DGB didn't respond about providing liquidity on atomicDEX

[17-Jul-19 12:24 PM] Malti#3948
so we could contact their discord admins to setup a bounty?

[17-Jul-19 12:24 PM] Malti#3948
ah too bad

[17-Jul-19 12:25 PM] Malti#3948
maybe now with all the fuzz they will change their mind?

[17-Jul-19 12:25 PM] SHossain#0007
if they would provide liquidity to their users, it would have been good

[17-Jul-19 12:25 PM] SHossain#0007
i've tested a lot of DGB swaps with this app

[17-Jul-19 12:30 PM] Pumtchak#0362
cool idea, but restricted for private beta users for now... maybe better to wait for open beta for such contest imo

[17-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Malti#3948
i tagged some crypto youtubers & trump (lol) in the comments of my latest tweet

[17-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Malti#3948
i Don't have a lot of followers, so feel free to retweet and even just copy paste the tweet into your own

[17-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Malti#3948
the more fuzz the better

[17-Jul-19 12:33 PM] Malti#3948
I was just telling some friends I did some 'funtrades' on AtomicDEX and honestly I don't see any reason for CEX anymore or why I should use it. And I'm not even super concerned (yet) about giving control etc.. the convenience of this just beats everything

[17-Jul-19 12:37 PM] CMaurice#1685
this app is great

We need a plan of attack, we can do swaps all day but we need to get people of reach to use it. VoskCoin would be a good start, maybe get @TS  (there are 2 TS btw) to do a explainer video

[17-Jul-19 12:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@SHossain lets get a BNB to KMD swap and tag CZ

[17-Jul-19 12:58 PM] hyperDEX#6586
LTC/KMD ETH/BCH

[17-Jul-19 12:59 PM] SHossain#0007
BNB is not listed anymore

[17-Jul-19 01:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
BSV/BCC

[17-Jul-19 01:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How come? Just not added?

[17-Jul-19 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
BCH is there

[17-Jul-19 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c i changed name to #dex-it . please let me know if you want me to revert that change

[17-Jul-19 01:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Cant we add more coins? I think adding BNB and LTC should be a priority in the next release

[17-Jul-19 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
please talk to @ca333 for adding new coins üòÉ

[17-Jul-19 01:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
CZ can retweet us pretty easily (especially if we send him an email before hand ......and ask for that USDT pair :troll_cool: ) if we use BNB

[17-Jul-19 01:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[17-Jul-19 01:12 PM] ca333#0118
lets inform Roger Ver about the BCH support

[17-Jul-19 01:13 PM] Malti#3948
with a twitter shitstorm, or how?

[17-Jul-19 01:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@ca333  he doesnt answer my emails any more lol, he used to.

[17-Jul-19 01:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But i think if we can do some trades, he is a clever man

[17-Jul-19 01:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
will come around

[17-Jul-19 01:27 PM] Malti#3948
let me get this straight:

I can login to *my* wallets
Trade from *my wallets*
accumulate KMD interest

all through faceID on my phone

[17-Jul-19 01:27 PM] Malti#3948
this is crazy

[17-Jul-19 01:28 PM] CMaurice#1685
Kind for vrsc orders

[17-Jul-19 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@Malti yes, it's awesome. but, we found a bug with FaceID which will be fixed in 1-2 weeks

[17-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Malti#3948
for me it works

[17-Jul-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
you are one lucky one

[17-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Malti#3948
and hey, this is what beta is for

[17-Jul-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
but, Android fingerprint never failed

[17-Jul-19 01:30 PM] Malti#3948
haha android

[17-Jul-19 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
my table is filled up with different android phones and an iPhone XS

[17-Jul-19 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
even 5 year old Android phone can do atomic swaps

[17-Jul-19 01:30 PM] Malti#3948
yeah, but iphones are shiny

:abusedsmily:

[17-Jul-19 01:35 PM] SHossain#0007
_but, not the best phones in the world_ :abused_smiley:

[17-Jul-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
Apple doesn't provide a USB C to Lightning cable with a ¬£1000 phone. They prefer you to buy one for ¬£18.

[17-Jul-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
what a ripoff!

[17-Jul-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
their strategy is, if users are able to spend ¬£1000 for a phone they def can spend ¬£18 extra for a cable

[17-Jul-19 01:37 PM] Malti#3948
i think it's fair to charge 999$ for a screen stand

[17-Jul-19 01:38 PM] Malti#3948
if a sucker is stupid enough to pay it, then they won

[17-Jul-19 01:38 PM] Malti#3948
and it ain't stupid if it works

[17-Jul-19 01:38 PM] Malti#3948
:abusedsmily:

[17-Jul-19 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007
at the end i had to buy a cable to use my iPhone XS directly with macbook pro which comes with only USB C port
