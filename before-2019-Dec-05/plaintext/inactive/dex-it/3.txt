If translation is done, then go for all those platforms @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± I‚Äôll send you some precious KMD into your wallet if you do so then

@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± do they like free money? üòÉ

[17-Jul-19 08:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Would 1 KMD/each motivate them to  try/do something?

[17-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@Malti  atomicDEX can make everyone's money safer, which is what everyone likes. No longer afraid of the platform being hacked, the platform is running.

[17-Jul-19 08:08 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@hyperDEX    Everyone loves it for free. 1KMD can have a good breakfast in China.

[17-Jul-19 08:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will wait for the translations to be done, then i think we will do some promotions for our Chinese friends

We need to start tagging news sites on twitter

[17-Jul-19 08:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± yep i will let you know. Maybe something like everyone testing it gets 0.88888888 , smaller winners getting 8.8888888 and a big winner of 88.888888 or something KMD

[17-Jul-19 08:16 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@hyperDEX     Many Chinese people can't get on discorapp because the network blockade is getting worse.

@hyperDEX   Wechat registration requires a mobile phone number, QQ does not need to.

@hyperDEX   WeChat is available for download on Google and should be registrable. Malaysia can also be used.
