everyone please read up the last 3 links. the last one is for claiming your funds that went missing today. the first 2 are to help you move your finds safely to another secure address if you have any coins like KMD, any Assetchains or 3rd-party coins. Please move them all to secure address if you used Agama lite mode in the last 5 months/

everyone 
there is no reported issue with the Komodo paper wallet, but there could be problems based on its source
https://www.coindesk.com/researcher-discovers-serious-vulnerability-in-paper-crypto-wallet-website
Our recommendation is to use one of these:
```
- Verus Agama (https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview)
- KomodoOcean QT (https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/folders/29000055193)
- Ledger Hardware wallet (Make sure the Ledger seed hasn't been input in the unsafe versions of Agama) 
```
Please remember if you have advised someone to use it and kindly get them to switch to one of the above

Anyone who still has the Komodo version of agama installed (0.3.6/0.3.5/0.3.4/mobile) please uninstall them 
you don't need it, just having a backup of old seed is enough for any future use

everyone If you have submitted a claim and didn't receive your funds back yet, please check your compromised address for some smartdust funds which you should send to the refund address you specified in your claim. If you haven't done it yet, please do so as this is a required step to receive your funds back quickly. If you didn't submit your claim yet, please do so ASAP. Currently we are processing refunds for correct and accurate claims daily and a lot of funds been refunded. Soon, we will be processing refunds weekly basis. If you need to claim, please use the forms above. Please don't resubmit same claims again and again as it will delay processing. Submit claims only once for each coin/address (if you haven't done it yet). Thanks for being an amazing community.

everyone It might seem obvious but DO NOT use your compromised seed with any wallet app. Move out any funds from an address previously used in official Agama to a new address using Verus Enhanced Agama from here https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html . 
If your seed was compromised, it doesn't matter which wallet you use to access it, it is still compromised. 

For more wallet option and recommendation read this post https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

It came to our attention that after receiving refunds from a safe address, some users sent coins back to their compromised address  which resulted in their balance being stolen. Please remember that once your original claim has been processed and you got refunded, KMD team cannot access your balance. At the moment the absolute majority of all valid claims were refunded including over 700,000 KMD that were stolen.

everyone Torsten Szabolcs Sandor, a member of the Komodo Marketing Team, was interviewed by iBlock TV at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei, Taiwan. In the interview, Torsten discusses how Komodo's technology has expanded far beyond its privacy coin roots and how Komodo's technology is different from other blockchain platforms.

"What we're building is an interoperable, multi-chain ecosystem, or a platform, that other projects or companies can build applications on."

everyone 

Today is one of the most exciting days in Komodo's history:

1. Our new logo and our new messaging are live on https://komodoplatform.com

2. The Komodo blockchain and all Smart Chains have been successfully updated at block 1444000.

3. Antara, an adaptable framework for simple, end-to-end blockchain development is now live on the Mainnet. Antara makes it easier than ever before to launch a Smart Chain, activate modules, and start building blockchain-based applications.

4. We are very excited to unveil the public beta of Antara Composer, a web app which lets anyone set up a Smart Chain, and deploy it on AWS complete with seed nodes and mining nodes, in just minutes: https://composer.kmd.io

5. The first 100 people are already testing AtomicDEX, with more to come.

6. Lastly, we completely revamped our developer documentations. With over 1000 pages of content, we believe it is one of the best in the whole industry: https://developers.komodoplatform.com

everyone **it is time for round 2**

The Komodo Platform team is pleased to announce the second stage of our hashtag and photo campaign. This weekend, starting with the release of version 0.1.3-a, our team will be randomly putting up RICK/KMD and MORTY/KMD orders. If you are fast enough to grab such an order and take the time to post a photo (showing the trade) according to the #dex-it rules`*`, our founder and lead-developer James 'jl777' Lee will even double up`**` the amount you were able to get. As an additional campaign bonus we hid an atomicDEX seed in THIS news article - funded with 77.7 KMD! 

This campaign will run a few days. Happy DEX hunting!



- rules: 
`*`   Tag your tweets with an additional #cryptopuzzle hashtag. 
`**` This only applies for RICK/KMD and MORTY/KMD orders that were set up by the Komodo team. 

- address related to the cryptopuzzle-seed: `RSDs5oihfMmaxqcqzzPT2LKQQoMjSdreSv`

Furthermore does v0.1.5 bring more freedom to the mobile DEX by showing the full market-view and enabling manual (limit) order-creation regardless of already existing orders. Please update atomicDEX mobile asap. Happy Testing!

There are scammers active in Discord with names similar to team members from this server.
Double check their username and make sure it matches with a team member in this server before initiating a conversation through direct messages.

Click on any username and you can see the username followed by a number. You can also see the "Roles" assigned to them in this server. 
For example, my username: gcharang#6833
If someone sends you a message claiming to be me, but their username has different numbers at the end, they are definitely a scammer
Even if you are sure that you are chatting with a team member, don't share your privatekeys/wifs/seed phrases for any reason

This is a great improvement as previously all those channels were at the bottom of the channel list and were thus hard to find. We hope that this change increases engagment within those channels.

everyone Komodo‚Äôs overall goal is to provide developers with the ability to build independent and self-sovereign smart chains that avoid the reliance of single-chain blockchain platforms. As such, Komodo has in no way endorsed the Komodore64(K64) project, nor are we responsible for vetting projects that build on Komodo‚Äôs open source technology. We are deeply concerned with several seemingly false statements made by members of the K64 team regarding project investments and we strongly advise those interested in participating in their project to practice extreme caution and due diligence ahead of time.

everyone Hold your hats!

The Komodo Team is pleased to present you the worlds first (pure) web-browser environment executed atomic swap! This means that we will eventually (soon) offer our users a pure web-based atomicDEX application which runs natively IN the web-browser without any external binaries or applications thus making atomicDEX available to pretty much all operating systems, platforms and devices.
Expect a dex.komodoplatform.com or web.atomicdex.io soon which basically offers you all the key features of atomicDEX mobile. This also means that the user data, private keys, etc. will always remain on the client-side and at no time will any sensitive data be transferred or stored on our servers. When a user visits the web-DEX URL the atomicDEX application will be loaded into the client/browser and then operates purely client-sided in a fully decentralised and blockchain based fashion. Special thanks to our DEX-core developers and blockchain architects Artem P. known as @artem.pikulin and Artem G. known as @artemciy_dice who turned a vision into reality, jl777 and the rest of the Komodo developer team. Exciting times are ahead!

Please don't click on those links, nor download them to keep yourself and your funds safe. The scammer is using github link `https://github.com/KomodoPlatforms`. Notice the extra `s` at the end.

everyone 

The Komodo team is extremely grateful for the overwhelming response we've received for the AtomicDEX Beta stress test. Due to this huge amount of participation, we hit bottlenecks in our infrastructure much sooner than we had anticipated. This led to a high percentage of swaps not matching properly. As such, we're adjusting the requirements for entry into the prize pool. All you need to do is match one swap and you're eligible to win prizes. It is not a requirement for the swap to successfully complete- one matched swap (1/3) is enough to make into the prize pool.

everyone - The Komodo team, specially our developers and QA experts, would like to thank all participants for their commitment and support during the first atomicDEX stress-test which was primarily held to collect backend, network and DEX-protocol metrics during the extreme high load and dynamic orderbooks. 
 
This is a high-level transparency report to summarise the events, results and details of this test.

We executed the stress-test with a minimum underlying hardware infrastructure which resulted in network layer failures during the (unexpected) load peak with ~2000 (!) simultaneous traders. This gladly delivered us essential data and metrics that will now allow us to fix this by refactoring the protocol - i.e. the networking part (rebroadcasting, routing client connections and orders, etc.). Our current networking model does increase the load with the growing number of network broadcast messages and thus lead to this unpleasant experience as it resulted in a ‚Äúnetwork bottleneck‚Äù where only a limited number of trades went through. Over 150 testers have been able to successfully execute almost 600 swaps during the stress-test and we want to highlight how important this stress-test in a limited environment is/was for the developers and engineers at Komodo. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Our experts will optimize the affected layer over the coming weeks and as soon as the DEX is ready for a full scale test (with multiple trading pairs and automatic spam clients) we will announce the next stress-test (with bigger prize pool) which will focus on the general trading experience as opposed to the load-test of this time. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

We will announce the winners tomorrow together with the final numbers (successful swap statistics will increase) and our team will also randomly honor testers that have not made it into the leaderboard! Thank you for your time and participation to help us perfect the DEX system.

everyone ‚Äì We now have a list of the stress test winners! The prizes will be sent during the coming days.

Huge thanks again to everyone who participated and kept going during the test. Komodo will announce the next phase of stress testing as soon as the DEX is ready for a full-scale scenario, in which multiple trading pairs will be tested while automatic spam clients bloat the network.

We also decided to send 0.777 KMD to everyone who kept testing but didn't win a prize. Keep testing the AtomicDEX app and send us feedback. We are continuously developing the application and thinking on how to improve it for the full release. We are looking to create one of the best wallets out there!

Take a note ‚úçÔ∏è about the following

1) On Discord, it is possible to **change name** and **even the four-digit code** to pretend to be someone else.
2) There have been daily phishing and scamming attempts on Komodo Discord server. Stay vigilant and help us to ban the scammers.
3) Scammers are using fake Github profiles and spreading fake wallets that will steal your coins. Don't click any links and always verify your download
4) To expose a scammer, you must allow Discord's development mode ('user settings' -> 'appearance') and copy their user ID (mine is 403137719049519106). Report the code to our @Community Moderators
