Upload file to AWS S3 bucket -> triggers lambda functions and metadata + hash writing to oracle

[25-Jan-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, hash to OP_RETURN is all thats needed... I created streamer that can upload file of any size into OP_RETURN .... but its not really suefl for most things... just place hash of file on BTC or any  dPOW coin.

[25-Jan-19 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have stored a 1MB file in memo fields directly on ZEC mainnet, with amount=0 and fee=0, just sayin' 😈

[25-Jan-19 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326

Hi,
this is some doc for Heir cc https://github.com/dimxy/Documentation/blob/patch-1/docs/source/cc/contracts/heir/introduction.rst

[26-Jan-19 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which branch is better for testing this?

[26-Jan-19 01:08 PM] dimxy#2587

thanks

[26-Jan-19 03:38 PM] dimxy#2587
@jl777c  what about the output variable names in heirinfo? Now they are called like 'owner inactivity time, sec', 'spending allowed for the heir',... (with spaces). Probably not very good names for rpc. Maybe, better to make them shorter and with no spaces?

[26-Jan-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[27-Jan-19 02:37 PM] dimxy#2587
There is a question about the suggestion to heir cc by @dukeleto to add a memo field.
Seems, just to add this memo with the owner's will is not enough because it is not clear for the Heir cc how to fulfill  the conditions in this memo. Now Heir cc contract unconditionally allows to spend the funds for the heir, if inactivity time is passed.
If we want to add some real world will, seems, we need who would execute its conditions. That is, we probably need 3-rd person, an executor of the will. He should add his signed permission to spend funds from our 1of2 cryptocondition where the funds are.

[27-Jan-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems to create a lot of unsolved issues and require trusted arbiter

[27-Jan-19 03:03 PM] dimxy#2587
Evidently yes, as it is going to be a connection to the real world (outside the blockchain)

[27-Jan-19 03:05 PM] dimxy#2587
I added this memo field to the new fix and marked it as 'for future use'

[27-Jan-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dimxy i see heir CC + memo field data being used together, to bridge the gap from "blockchain smart contract" to "signed + human notarized PDF of a will" (which stands up in court)

[27-Jan-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
no legal precedent for heir CC, means it needs help to be considered "real". tying together a legal will with a heir CC, i think makes it much stronger

[27-Jan-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
the will can specify exactly what the heir CC is, and give instructions to the heir on how to use it, solve all the "icky" real-world problems that heir CC internals avoid

[27-Jan-19 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
to clarify, my idea is that memo fields + heir CC's get tied together at a higher level, up the stack, not changing the heir CC to use memo fields directly

[27-Jan-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 you might have some opinion re: the above ^^^

[27-Jan-19 04:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Great, adjusting tests for latest PR

[27-Jan-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy ```"OwnerRemainderTokens": "0"``` What this param should reflect? It's 0 before and after claiming

[27-Jan-19 05:10 PM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL  it shows if the owner has some 'unconverted' tokens on his balance. If you did heirfund for all the created token amount then it should be 0. That is, tokenbalance would show the same value

[28-Jan-19 09:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Updated heir seems fine so far @dimxy 
Params errors still returns not in JSON:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 heirfund -1 100 test 024f4f2b781c247b3609ba777a222d93d44182466c01dad3f2aa0def2be8f69e56 100

error message:

```
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 heirfund 0 100 test 024f4f2b781c247b3609ba777a222d93d44182466c01dad3f2aa0def2be8f69e56 0
error code: -1
error message:

And so on

[28-Jan-19 09:15 AM] TonyL#3577
As example for diceCC:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 dicefund test 10000 0 0 0 0
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "invalid parameter error"
}
```
As I remember there is some errors returning solution defined in rpc code which using by other CCs (https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo/commit/ab3ae964e16f4a89e1606723cd784e9463ccacf7)

[28-Jan-19 09:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Little issue I found on params validation stage.
Negative txfee retrurns error:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 heirfund -1 100 test 024f4f2b781c247b3609ba777a222d93d44182466c01dad3f2aa0def2be8f69e56 100
error code: -1
error message:
incorrect txfee param```
Random text input as txfee accepts (creating tx with default txfee so it not seems a big issue, but anyway I think it's not good that text input accepting in this field):
```

BTW about the 'memo' param: I added it as a first try just to OP_RETURN. So it is limited by 10000 b and I added some recommendations for its content (that is, if the 'will' is too big  the put the url on it and its hash).

@Mihailo `git merge -Xtheirs` or `git merge -Xours` will either resolve all conflicts with the other branch, or your current branch's changes. Sometimes it's what you want

[28-Jan-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
-X lets you tell git a "merge strategy"

[28-Jan-19 01:06 PM] Mihailo#5902
@dukeleto  Thnx. I usually use VSCode to see the changes and resolve conflicts. But I always stop and check with myself which changes are mine 😛

[28-Jan-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
the github merge conflict web tool is pretty decent too

[28-Jan-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dimxy cool, it just makes sense to allow using that extra data. ~10KB is enough for a textual representation of a will, with perhaps a URL + hash to a signed PDF version

@LamboLlama Yea there's a cryptocondition contract developed by @KomodoPlatform called CC Heir. Here's the article on how it works. https://t.co/2zFrzmA5Ql
and they have a discord channel dedicated to it too
Twitter

[18-Feb-19 01:38 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy I am going through the heir doc now,
```
After the inactivity time has passed, both the heir and owner may freely claim available funds. This is achieved by that that after the first heir spending, a special flag is set depicting that spending is allowed for the heir from now on, whether the owner adds more funds or spends them.
```
Can you explain who sets the special flag ? miners or the heir when he submits the claim transaction?

[18-Feb-19 01:46 PM] dimxy#2587
the heir sets this flag when he successfully claims funds first time  (after inactivity time passed)

[18-Feb-19 02:38 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it.

[18-Feb-19 03:27 PM] gcharang#6833
```
When using Heir contract on a private chain, to make funds available for the heir, you should wait for inactivity time and add any arbitrary transaction to the chain (for the duration between owner tx and chain tip to be calculated correctly).
```
"you should wait" --  here is it the heir?

[18-Feb-19 03:29 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy are private funds be able to use in inheritance? If not what is the difference here from a purely public chain?

[18-Feb-19 03:33 PM] dimxy#2587
well I suggest removing this (this is just for testing), sorry, overlooked

[18-Feb-19 03:37 PM] gcharang#6833
So, there are no special/extra things to be done by anyone for the heir contract in a private chain that are not needed in a public chain?

[18-Feb-19 03:38 PM] gcharang#6833
I mean is there any difference in the usage of the contract on a chain where private transactions are possible VS a pure Public chain?

[18-Feb-19 03:38 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy

[18-Feb-19 03:44 PM] dimxy#2587
I used the name 'private' chain incorrectly, I meant 'test chains'
There is no differences in using heir cc on various chains
The difference might be in that on KMD chain heir cc will be used with coins, on asset chain it will be used with tokens. It supports both

[18-Feb-19 03:46 PM] gcharang#6833
Ah, got it. Will just delete the note.

[18-Feb-19 03:48 PM] gcharang#6833
Is this statement true:
```
The `heiradd` rpc call warns the user that he is making a donation to the fund if he is neither the **owner** nor the **heir**
```

[18-Feb-19 03:54 PM] gcharang#6833
```
The `heiradd` rpc call doesn't allow addition of funds from both owner and non-owner inputs in a single transaction. In any case such fund additions will be considered as donations too.
```
So the rpc call doesn't allow it, but if someone creates a raw transaction manually to include both owner and non-owner inputs in the fund transaction, will the other nodes reject it? @dimxy I mean does such a txn break consensus rules?

[18-Feb-19 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
how can someone else spend funds out of owner address?

[18-Feb-19 03:57 PM] gcharang#6833
If the wallet has utxo of both owner pubkey and and another pubkey then can't a txn be constructed that adds funds from both to the heir fund?

[18-Feb-19 03:59 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes, here it states about if someone manages to create a tx with both owner inputs and other inputs (having both keys)

[18-Feb-19 03:59 PM] dimxy#2587
Is it an artifical situation?

[18-Feb-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
only the owner would be able to do that

[18-Feb-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
unless he is hacked

[18-Feb-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but if this tx is rejected anyway, what is the issue?

[18-Feb-19 04:00 PM] gcharang#6833
I am asking if it is rejected

[18-Feb-19 04:01 PM] gcharang#6833
I mean is it rejected now according to the heir contract

[18-Feb-19 04:02 PM] dimxy#2587
Such tx would not be rejected now and it would be considered as donations to the heir fund (if it is created bypassing the rpc)

[18-Feb-19 04:03 PM] dimxy#2587
we are speaking about normal inputs BTW

[18-Feb-19 04:03 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it.  So such a txn won't reset the countdown to inactivity period?

[18-Feb-19 04:04 PM] dimxy#2587
yes donations won't reset the inactivity countdown

[18-Feb-19 04:04 PM] dimxy#2587
only owner tx will do that

[18-Feb-19 04:06 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it. btw @dimxy after I have gone through the doc, can you please go through it again to check if everything is accurate?

[18-Feb-19 04:07 PM] dimxy#2587
yes of course, 
is it on the dev branch?

@dimxy why do we have txfee as parameter to rpc call? I don't seems to recall that other have it...
