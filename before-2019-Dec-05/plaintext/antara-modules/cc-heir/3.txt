We may remove it in the next heir fix

[19-Feb-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it is usually hidden param

[19-Feb-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
probably best that way

[19-Feb-19 11:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, just checking if we need to have this param, as I don't have it in my cc rpc calls

[19-Feb-19 01:24 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy 
```
| fundingtxid           | (string)  |txid of this heir funding plan creation tx, used as a handler to it
```
can you explain what ` used as a handler` means?

[19-Feb-19 01:29 PM] dimxy#2587
'reference' maybe better

[19-Feb-19 01:33 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it.

[19-Feb-19 02:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy 
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY1 heiraddress 
```
without `pubkey` as an argument throws an error. Is it expected behaviour? Some of the other CC for the address RPC, will use the pubkey that was used to start the daemon with to calculate the addresses

[19-Feb-19 02:10 PM] dimxy#2587
I think yes it is expected behaviour because without hear pubkey we cannot output funds 1of2 address

[19-Feb-19 02:12 PM] gcharang#6833
So, in a daemon started with owner pubkey, we need to use the command
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKDIMXY1 heiraddress <heir's pubkey>
```
correct?

[19-Feb-19 02:13 PM] dimxy#2587
yes, the param of heiraddress is heir's pubkey, and the daemon's pubkey would be the owner pubkey

[19-Feb-19 02:17 PM] gcharang#6833

can you tell me what `myCCbalance` is?

[19-Feb-19 02:17 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy

[19-Feb-19 02:23 PM] dimxy#2587
Most of the output of heiraddress is formed  by a commonly used function. 
I need to see what it does

[19-Feb-19 02:24 PM] dimxy#2587
I can even see duplications  like 'myAddress' and 'myaddress'

[19-Feb-19 02:24 PM] gcharang#6833
for tokens: 
```
myCCaddress    (string)    taking the token contract's EVAL code as a modifier, this is the CC address from the pubkey of the user
```
but here there are 2 pubkeys so i am a bit confused

[19-Feb-19 02:26 PM] dimxy#2587
here it should be 'funds owner' or 'owner' as we defined what is 'owner' in the beginning of the doc

[19-Feb-19 02:27 PM] dimxy#2587
no

[19-Feb-19 02:27 PM] gcharang#6833
"myCCAddress(Heir)" and "myCCaddress" seem to be the same

[19-Feb-19 02:28 PM] dimxy#2587
yes, i'm going to see how this function  gets those values

[19-Feb-19 02:29 PM] gcharang#6833
ok. I will leave this `heiraddress` part for later

[19-Feb-19 03:04 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy 
I have gone through the heir-cc doc and made some edits. I will add to the `heiraddress` section once I get more clarification from you. Its correct as it is but missing some of the confusing keys like `myccaddress` and `myccbalance`

Its here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/gcharang/docs/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-heir.md

repo: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/
branch: gcharang

When you have some time, please go through it and suggest corrections to me here in discord or as a PR to the `gcharang` branch, whichever suits you better.

@gcharang  I went through your heir docs version.  It is great, I liked it!

Some notes about heiraddress:
My understanding is that for heir cc contract only following addresses are relevant:
HeirCCAddress        (string)        taking the contract's EVAL code as a modifier, this is the public address that corresponds to the heir contract's privkey. It is used internally for special marker storage
HeirCC1of2Address    (string)        address for storing funds in coins spendable by owner and heir (funds address)
HeirCC1of2TokensAddress    (string)    address for storing funds in tokens spendable by owner and heir (token funds address)
MyAddress                            user normal address to withdraw funds in coins from heir cc funds address    <--- this is for any user who wants to use heir cc (owner or heir) 
MyTokenAddress                        user address to withdraw funds in tokens from heir cc token funds address    <--- not present now, should be added

And I'm not sure if we need to output any balances here. Seems this heiraddress function purpose is to give some info about contracts addresses to use them in other rpc methods

[20-Feb-19 08:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy 
MyTokenAddress is not present in the response from `./komodo-cli -ac_name=TESTAC heiraddress <pubkey>`
is it going to be added in the future?

[20-Feb-19 08:13 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, I m going to add it

[20-Feb-19 08:14 AM] gcharang#6833
Got it. The doc will be published in the developers.komodoplatform.com by the end of this week. Many thanks

I would very much like the Heir CC to be enabled in Hush, and I see that new improvements are still flowing in, which is great to see. Can anyone estimate if more consensus changes are coming soon, or is it mostly RPC-layer stuff that will be changing?

```- Heir
  - Insert Heir CC proof of concept here - [link]```

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Heir CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!

[12-Nov-19 01:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm what if add possibility to add not only coins heir but encoded information as well, as soon as heir time heir pubkey can decode it. I can record info where to find some data lets say (such as privkeys, where I store funds and etc). Like a data heir

@gcharang txfee param was removed for all heirCC calls. Could you please update the doc: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/heir.html#heir ?

[19-Nov-19 03:20 PM] gcharang#6833
will do!

[19-Nov-19 04:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL hey, I have the latest jl777/FSM daemon running
it looks like only heirclaim had the txfee param removed?
```bash
./c1 help | grep heir                                                                       
heiradd txfee funds fundingtxid
heiraddress pubkey
heirclaim funds fundingtxid
heirfund txfee funds heirname heirpubkey inactivitytime memo [tokenid]
heirinfo fundingtxid
heirlist
```
should I be looking at some other branch?

[19-Nov-19 04:42 PM] TonyL#3577
yes @gcharang it's in other branch at the moment. @dimxy working on heir patch atm and it'll be available in FSM then

[19-Nov-19 04:43 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, will wait for it

[20-Nov-19 04:22 AM] Regnar#6164
There was a discussion about Tipbots giving coins to random people on Twitter and how it would be great if they could take those coins back if the person doesn't touch them in N amount of time. I was thinking this could be something Heir CC could do.

`Should the owner fail to interact with the 1of2 Antara address for a specified period of time (inactivitytime), the address automatically unlocks to the second key. This second key is owned by the heir. Once unlocked, both the creator and the heir may freely spend funds from the address.`

In this example the first key would be the person being tipped, and the second key would be the Tipbot itself. We set the date to 1 month (or w.e.) So a tip is made to someone and if they don't interact with the wallet or withdraw the funds, the second key unlocks `the heir` and they bring the tokens back to the tipper.

[20-Nov-19 04:29 AM] Regnar#6164
If this is even possible (setting yourself as an heir in an outbound transaction) obviously this could be bad if wallets send these types of transactions as "Payments" for something, only to reverse it if/when the Heir key opens up. So hopefully there is a way to check for Heirs, if a transaction has an heir, wallets could automate sending the transaction to themselves or something. There might also need to be a minimum time for Heirs so that it doesn't reverse the very next block.

[20-Nov-19 01:03 PM] Regnar#6164
@turinglabs was reading the posts in #komodo-team, maybe this would be something for future ideas ^^

{Reactions}
üëå 

[20-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Regnar#6164
My understanding is it uses Antara addresses so it likely wont be an issue for people receiving these as payments, since it would be different type of transaction/address then typical KMD transactions

@jl777c what is the risk to HUSH of merging in that Heir CC fix? heir CC is active on hush mainnet

[21-Nov-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it only changed the rpc calls and not the consensus, but @dimxy should confirm if it is backward compatible with existing heir CC or not. i sure hope it is

[21-Nov-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c is there a way to tell how many active CCs are on a chain? We have a few CCs active on Hush mainnet, but I have no idea if they are being used at all

[21-Nov-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
specifically, is there a way I can tell if there are Heir CCs existing on Hush mainnet?

[21-Nov-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
it seems that a node could keep track of this, but might not be doing this currently

[21-Nov-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
would need to scan all CC tx

[21-Nov-19 01:58 PM] dimxy#2587
the heir cc fix is fully compatible with previous versions (its purpose is to fix broken rpc heirclaim, what seems occurred in merging, and removed txfee param from rpc as it was requested)

[21-Nov-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dimxy thanks for clarification

[21-Nov-19 01:59 PM] dimxy#2587
to check if heir txns exist you might call heirlist

[21-Nov-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
$ ./hush-cli heirlist
[
]
```

[21-Nov-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
that just shows my own, i imagine

[21-Nov-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
$ ./hush-cli heirlist help
error code: -1
error message:
heirlist
```

[21-Nov-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, heirlist help could be filled out a bit üôÇ

[21-Nov-19 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c just like an addressindex, there could be a CCindex which the node stores data about CC xtns it sees during syncing, right? Not sure it's needed, but I am just trying to understand more. What if we wanted to show off how many CC's of teach type were being used in all smart chains, on a real-time-ish website ?

[21-Nov-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you could do a special rpc call that iterates through the DB with the CC flag set

[21-Nov-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, that makes sense to my broken brain, which has fixed stuff at the DB layer

[21-Nov-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the snapshot rpc call is very close to what you want

[21-Nov-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it currently iterates through all the non-CC addresses

[21-Nov-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
change the flag to get the CC addresses with non-zero balance. then by looking at the exact type of CC vout, you should be able to determine which CC it is for

[21-Nov-19 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
that sounds like a fun RPC to write, or maybe just an optional arg to the `getsnapshot` RPC, which I have some history with
