you can do `tail -f ~/.komodo/BRK/debug.log` for the debug.log

[22-Aug-18 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
you're getting a completely different error than me

[22-Aug-18 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
I get the `missing inputs` error on 1 VPS on a fresh node and it works on the other VPS on a fresh node

[22-Aug-18 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
pretty confused about that

[22-Aug-18 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh...  debug.log ```2018-08-22 10:10:21 connect() to 103.18.58.150:35102 failed after select(): No route to host (113)```

[22-Aug-18 10:11 AM] Alright#0419

[22-Aug-18 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
that's your node trying to connect to peers it got from the DNS seeder

[22-Aug-18 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405

[22-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
building komodod on a third VPS to see what happens >.<

[22-Aug-18 10:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I didn't build, only ran `./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK dicebet BORKED fd6093b89df7cbb68796ad014682641cd74fd6bdd6b3599faf1474941afe5dc9 57 1`

[22-Aug-18 10:17 AM] CrisF#3405

[22-Aug-18 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
fresh VPS and it worked fine 😣

[22-Aug-18 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand how spamming completely broke my komodod build's ability to do `dicebet`

[22-Aug-18 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
deleted the entire data directory *3* times, tested from scratch each time

[22-Aug-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but a fresh node worked?

[22-Aug-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly something is broken, need to isolate what

[22-Aug-18 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
Christ, it's time for bed 😣 my rawsend script was trying to send it on the wrong chain

[22-Aug-18 10:34 AM] Alright#0419

[22-Aug-18 10:36 AM] SHossain#0007
i just did a dicebet of `BORKED` and won
```

dice plan's dealer node needs to run dicestatus call in a cron task, or if anything happens to his node's realtime responses, all the dicebets will timeout and payout as winners and consume entropy tx

[22-Aug-18 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
I have this in stdout ```CC Eval EVAL_DICE Invalid: DiceCalc mismatch for win/loss spending tx 098191216c728fc69ff3b84a696be30edb41362bad9092ff5b2a39e620171f6d```
before this came up
```Dice plan (BORKED) already exists cmpflag.1```

[22-Aug-18 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if useful...

[22-Aug-18 10:45 AM] SHossain#0007
what is your command?
HEX value?

[22-Aug-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
how did you get that error?

[22-Aug-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an invalid dicebet completion

[22-Aug-18 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
It came up on startup it seems.

[22-Aug-18 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Then ran 
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK dicebet BORKED fd6093b89df7cbb68796ad014682641cd74fd6bdd6b3599faf1474941afe5dc9 57 1`

[22-Aug-18 10:46 AM] CrisF#3405
and this came up 
`Dice plan (BORKED) already exists cmpflag.1
`

[22-Aug-18 10:48 AM] SHossain#0007
i haven't seen that. but, i'll test a fresh sync now and lookout for the above error.
btw, which branch you are using?

[22-Aug-18 10:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Same as I'm running for STAKED2 - `dev`

[22-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, forgot to mention that

[22-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
dice contract differs between dev and jl777 branches

[22-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
you'll want to build from jl777 for BRK

[22-Aug-18 10:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Will jl777 be OK with STAKED2 also?

[22-Aug-18 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007

[22-Aug-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
alternatively, you can copy compilied binaries from different branch into different directory and issue calls from there.

[22-Aug-18 10:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Would jl777 branch effect VerusCoin staking?  I have another vps doing that.

[22-Aug-18 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
VRSC using completely different daemon

[22-Aug-18 10:59 AM] CrisF#3405
So no problem to use that then?

[22-Aug-18 10:59 AM] SHossain#0007
nope

[22-Aug-18 11:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Great, that's what I'll try.  (Not sure how to `copy compilied binaries from different branch into different directory and issue calls from there` yet.

[22-Aug-18 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
Example:
After compiling komodo using jl777 branch, use:
```
cd ~
mkdir jl777
cp ~/komodo/src/komodod ~/jl777/komodod
cp ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli ~/jl777/komodo-cli
cd jl777
./komodod ........
```
After compiling komodo using dev branch, use:
```
cd ~
mkdir dev
cp ~/komodo/src/komodod ~/dev/komodod
cp ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli ~/dev/komodo-cli
cd dev
./komodod ........
```
just basic copy-paste

actually I cant

[22-Aug-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
diceaddfund is not spending CC, so what I do is ignore anything that is too small

[22-Aug-18 11:17 AM] Alright#0419
Could you add something like `dicelist <pubkey>`?

[22-Aug-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
what would it do?

[22-Aug-18 12:39 PM] CrisF#3405

I am trying to find all them on STAKED2 atm, but we are on an older version so not sure whats been changed

[22-Aug-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What you need to do, is have the terminal where you started `komodod` open and monitor what it prints out there, as they have more info on what is going on.

[22-Aug-18 01:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Didn't see anything starnge there, but I probably wouldn't know, haha.

That wouldn't cover my payout if I won.

[22-Aug-18 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
(I think)

[22-Aug-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that might be the issue then. I saw on STAKED2 that it would print for minbet/maxbet if you went under/over those

[22-Aug-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I havent had it have less funding than the max bet yet

[22-Aug-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its going to be hard to do that, as its 50/50 odds and max bet is 2, and it has 500 coins in it.. so like impossible to happen lol

[22-Aug-18 01:38 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r  Yeah

[22-Aug-18 01:38 PM] CrisF#3405
In this case though it's not maxbet.

[22-Aug-18 01:39 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm under the max bet, but with the odds I was betting it would need to payout more than the 904 funds available if I won.

[22-Aug-18 01:41 PM] CrisF#3405
It would need to pay out 4662 again if I won.

[22-Aug-18 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
no problem, happy to help the CC revolution 👍

[22-Aug-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
there are only a very few types in bitcoin. pay to pubkey, pay to pubkey hash and pay to script hash
p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh
there are actually more that are possible, but those three are 99%+ of bitcoin transactions
so you can pay to a pubkey, or to its hash. or to a script's hash. the last is how most of the more complex scripts are invoked. to spend a p2sh vout, you need to provide the redeemscript, this script's hash is what the p2sh address was.
all of the above are the standard bitcoin vout types and there should be plenty of materials about it
Encrypted by a verified device
what I did with the CC contracts is created a fourth type of vout, the CC vout. this is using the cryptoconditions standard and it is even a different signature mechanism. ed25519 instead of secp256k1. it is basically a big extension to the bitcoin script. There is a special opcode that is added that says it is a CC script.
but it gets more interesting

[22-Aug-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
each CC script has an evalcode
this is just an arbitrary number. but what it does is allows to create a self-contained universe of CC utxo that all have the same evalcode and that is how a faucet CC differentiates itself from a dice CC, the eval code is different

one effect from using a different eval code is that even if the rest of the CC script is the same, the bitcoin address that is calculated is different. what this means is that for each pubkey, there is a unique address for each different eval code!
and this allows efficient segregation of one CC contracts transactions from another

[22-Aug-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the final part that will make it all clear how the funds can be locked inside the contract. this is what makes a contract, a contract. I put both the privkey and pubkey for a randomly chosen address and associate it with each CC contract. That means anybody can sign outputs for that privkey. However, it is a CC output, so in addition to the signature, whatever constraints a CC contract implements must also be satistifed. This allows funds to be locked and yet anybody is able to spend it, assuming they satisfy the CC's rules

one other technical note is that komodod has the insight-explorer extensions built in. so it can lookup directly all transactions to any address. this is a key performance boosting thing as if it wasnt there, trying to get all the utxo for an address not in the wallet is quite time consuming
