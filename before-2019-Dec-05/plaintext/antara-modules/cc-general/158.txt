Thanks I will working on this

[28-Feb-19 04:14 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
How do I change the p2p port of so that I can connect to my local network node?

[28-Feb-19 06:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
@josephnicholas GMT+8 I had success with changing p2p port with -port= even I was told it cannot be changed.

[28-Feb-19 06:09 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Well, good for you, I had to recreate the chain then mine again, but it was worth it.

[28-Feb-19 06:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think you don't need to create new chain, but never tried to change port after creating chain.

[04-Mar-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
I implemented unique handles for dilithium CC, but the unique names aspect might be of more general interest

[05-Mar-19 04:29 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks

[06-Mar-19 12:43 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Is there a CC that can generate fungible tokens (such as in game items)  yet?

[06-Mar-19 12:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64  Hopefully we can figure this out here.

[06-Mar-19 01:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Tokens (both fungible and not) creating by TokensCC RPC calls. For example  ROGUE using nonfungible tokens (with supply 1). If fungible tokens needed - just token with supply > 1 needs to be created. There are "name" and "description" params on token creation - so there is possible to specify dAPP specific tags/metadata to track/identify specific tokens

[06-Mar-19 01:08 AM] TonyL#3577
List of RPC calls with request/response examples can be found in google doc from this channel topic

[06-Mar-19 01:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Create new token is very easy: `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MYCHAIN tokencreate MyNewToken <supply> "description of my new token"`
And then just broadcast raw hex output to blockchain by `sendrawtransaction hex^^`

@TonyL wua thanks!

[06-Mar-19 01:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL while browsing through the pinned items I got to a GH repo, with some Pythonian magic called TUI's. Am I mistaken or are these working RPC clients?

[06-Mar-19 01:26 AM] TonyL#3577
@TwilightPunkster K64 This TUI I made for things testing mostly. It using RPC proxy client for communicating with komodo daemon RPC

[06-Mar-19 01:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(also your pad supernet link is dead üò¢ )

So in general process as easy as:

[06-Mar-19 01:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Creating proxy object by: `rpc_connection = Proxy(rpc_credentials_here)` (it setup/create proxy between your app and komodod daemon)

[06-Mar-19 01:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Then issuing calls by `rpc_connection.call([args])` For example `new_token_info = rpc_connection.tokencreate("Token", "1", "Testing token")`

[06-Mar-19 01:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
is it really that simple?

[06-Mar-19 01:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, just 1 pip package is needed

[06-Mar-19 01:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[06-Mar-19 01:32 AM] TonyL#3577
It built on top of pycur and curl

[06-Mar-19 01:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
no way

[06-Mar-19 01:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I spend like 2 days with 4 hours sleep in between reading stuff and this is the thing i was looking for xD

[06-Mar-19 01:33 AM] TonyL#3577
So if let's say I want to start new project:
`pip3 install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc`
Then in code:
`from slickrpc import Proxy`

I remember playing Tetris with my Dad on a brand new NES console, back in the olden days

there is a maketetris script in cc dir

it just builds the dapp

[07-Mar-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it is unmodified for now and being curses based very primitive looking, but seems to be tetris

[07-Mar-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a very small code to do the tetris, so should simplify the making of CC. the idea here is that not doing anything, generates an event, ie. if you dont do anything, time passes. this is different from rogue where the clock was each new game action keystroke

[07-Mar-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
interesting. so tetris will need a "timeout" event that corresponds to the current object hitting the floor, or potentially a shorter timeout if it hits existing objects

[07-Mar-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking more just a "time passed" event which will feed into the tetris engine. likely i will need to add an event compression layer to prevent very long keystrokes tx

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
or for a demo, we can just limit to 8000 events. what is the longest a tetris level can take to do?

[07-Mar-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
ok as long as it is decent, i will push forward with it, it is quite efficiently coded and i like that

[07-Mar-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we can use the same framework as rogue, just using tetris keystrokes instead

[07-Mar-19 10:32 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c joker and I were talking about this last night. It seems the randomness in tetris is this
```
Give the player each of the 7 tetrominoes, in a random order.

Give the player each of the 7 tetrominoes, in a random order.

Give the player each of the 7 tetrominoes, in a random order.```
https://tetrisconcept.net/threads/the-tetris-guidelines-random-generator-is-apparently-simple.349/

We were trying to think how this would best work. I'm not sure you're able to make a game that is deterministically random as it uses a RNG every 7 blocks to determine the next 7. I thought maybe instead user could broadcast "I want to play a game. I will multiply the next notarization hash by <arbitrary number>. They then multiply the notarization txid by <arbitrary number> and this gives them the 64 blocks(0-f represent different blocks) that are unique to them. Unique because of the arbitrary number they are multiplying the notarization txid by

The Tetris guidelines Random Generator is apparently simple. | Tet...
In games adhering to the official Tetris Guidelines, most notably TDS, the randomizer is known to not be purely random. In fact, the randomizer's rules...

[07-Mar-19 10:33 PM] Alright#0419
basically, is it possible to make a tetris engine that will give the same result given the same seed and inputs? If not, does this make sense instead? Network itself(notaries actually) generate "randomness"

[07-Mar-19 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
we also talked about how we could actually validate game logic. It essentially requires every node to replay every game at this point, yes? A keystrokes tx would come in that claimed something like "with this random seed, with these inputs, I got this score." then each node would replay this game and verify that score is what the user claims given same seed and same inputs?

[07-Mar-19 10:38 PM] Alright#0419
Joker had the idea instead to have a subset of nodes that validate games similar to notaries agreeing on blockhashes. If m of n agree(after replaying game and validating score), then it is valid

[08-Mar-19 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, something like this will be required as the games get more complex. Something like tetris maybe is easy enough... but going too complex with too many keystrokes is not going to work so well. So needs to be simpler.. Less data on chain will be required. There will be a few ways to do this.  But not really sure whats possible. Something that would be ideal, is if you can use a zkSNARK to prove the gameplay rather than have all nodes have to replay every game. I can see a full bock of tetris game txs grinding the chain to halt very fast.

[08-Mar-19 06:23 AM] Mylo#8306
sounds like a seed-generate-resolution, every X seconds.
with a hashchain of seeds, you can have hundreds of seeds for thousands of seconds of gameplay.

if we're thinking about games beyond console, e.g. FPS, think about monsters spawning then acting on the seed they are given in the hashchain, all verifiable.   along with player co-ordinates, velocity etc. again a resolution thing.   this is where streamer data comes in handy @blackjok3r 

the life-cycle of all these can be compacted down with chain consolidation at a business/operations level.  active gamers will migrate all their accumulated stuff

[08-Mar-19 06:23 AM] Mylo#8306
