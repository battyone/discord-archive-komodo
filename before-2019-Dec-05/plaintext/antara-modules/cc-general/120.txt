the rpc should error check as much as possible, but if the validation isnt complete, it can mess up when an attack makes an rpc invalid but validation valid tx

[22-Oct-18 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, so better to check CC code in such cases so even if RPC not generating transaction with such input it's possible to generate it and broadcast manually in some attack vector

[22-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, needs to be in both, with the validation ok to be a little more lenient as long as it doesnt allow attacks

[22-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
just imagine there are bad people out there willing to do bad things

[22-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
yes, it must first be done in validation so nobody can transmit tx with bad data. Then the RPC can check if you are inputing wrong things to return error instead of transmitting the tx.

[22-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
BTW, which port is used on nodes for AC, is it same 7770? I'm setting up one node at my home server to be for mining on AC ....

[22-Oct-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
getinfo

[22-Oct-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it shows rpc port

[22-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, saw it. So I see it is using random port, I'll set some specific and forward it 😉

Excited for your project @forkwitch 😃

[23-Oct-18 03:03 PM] xbis#8594
@jl777c  hi there! I was adviced by Julio to ping you 😃

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
hello! did you get through the Mastering Crypto conditions

[23-Oct-18 03:08 PM] xbis#8594
I am going to finish today

[23-Oct-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, I would like you to start thinking about a payments CC

[23-Oct-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
basically a general purpose CC that allows people to lock funds into their CC address and then have restrictions on how it can be spent

[23-Oct-18 03:10 PM] xbis#8594
could we start from a simple task? just for test)

[23-Oct-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, that was the simple task...

[23-Oct-18 03:10 PM] xbis#8594
ok, waiting for it)

[23-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the initial payments CC wont have to have much functionality. just a way for users to fund their account and a way for payments to be made from it

[23-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
we can then iterate to add more and more features

[23-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so locking funds and releasing,is the basic feature

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] xbis#8594
what is the difference from rewards?

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
it is most similar to rewards, but rewards come back to the original user

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] xbis#8594
ok, I see

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
what I am thinking of for payments is to be able to have your monthly bills paid from it

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
DirectDebit method?

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
not exactly. but the concept of regular payments, with maximum limits

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you are paying for electric bill, you can authorize a certain amount per month and then know that it wont pay more than that

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
a way to protect your funds that are in the hot wallet

[23-Oct-18 03:15 PM] jusoaresf#3291
and it can still vary within that limit like the bills do...

[23-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. and maybe you can send a payment yourself, or just respond to an invoice

[23-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
automatic recurring payments

[23-Oct-18 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
nice. paying server bills like that month after month would be cool

[23-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually basically anything and everything about doing payments

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007
though, that is just only one usage 😃

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if anybody has desired features, now is the time to voice it

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] xbis#8594
so it shall be like automatic invoice payments with the [month/week/...] limit

[23-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, lets start with that

[23-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jusoaresf#3291
and max value limit (?)

[23-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
my guess is over time, it will get a lot more features, but that is a good start. and max limit definitely

[23-Oct-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so once you put funds in this address, then you know it will go out toward bills

[23-Oct-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
protects against anybody spending the funds on anything else, even yourself

[23-Oct-18 03:21 PM] jusoaresf#3291
no allow_from_address for invoices?

[23-Oct-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
these are the details that @xbis needs to determine

[23-Oct-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
what is needed to make a useful payments CC

[23-Oct-18 03:22 PM] xbis#8594
thanks, I 'll try))

[23-Oct-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to discuss what the required features are and once that is set for v1, then we lock down the details

[23-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
a CC is very limited in scope, but very powerful, it does take a bit to get up to speed but once you do amazing things are possible in relatively short time.

[23-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely ask questions!

[23-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
this is likely new territory and other than the code and Mastering CC, there are no other docs

[23-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, there are all the testing docs, which might help

[23-Oct-18 03:25 PM] xbis#8594

[23-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the general concept is to create a "balance" based view for funds and the rpc for it would be on that basis

[23-Oct-18 03:25 PM] xbis#8594
thanks))

[24-Oct-18 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have added 2 fixes to komodod that I think you guys might find useful. 
1) getinfo now shows your active -pukey 
2) there is a new RPC `setpubkey` that allows you to set the -pubkey if it is not set, without restarting the deamon.

{Reactions}
shexy 👏 

[24-Oct-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not 100% sure that setpubkey wont break things, but I assume, you wont actually be doing anything that would be accessing the pubkey before you set it. Its mostly there for noobs/testers of CC when they get the "you need a -pubkey set" they cna just go ahead and set it rather than have to gin around restarting things, people seem to find that confusing all the time.

[24-Oct-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you would like a PR to FSM please let me know and I can do that

[24-Oct-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Oct-18 05:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Hey @blackjok3r ! I can test this call itself and make auto-tests which will test crypto-conditions stuff with this parameter usage for pubkey setting

{Reactions}
👌 

[24-Oct-18 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did it on staked, so a PR will need to be made against FSM ... its not much code though

[24-Oct-18 05:46 AM] TonyL#3577
I think such call will help in dapps development a lot since there is no way now to proper validate pubkey matching in wallet and daemon param

[24-Oct-18 05:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Confused me a lot also when started with gateway cc 😃

[24-Oct-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes ... I think maybe one other thing should be added before I make PR and thats actually validate the pubkey .. currrently I used the same validation as the -pubkey start param uses, which is test length is 66 ... you can litterally put anything in there as long as its 66 char long. 

I think I can make it return the Raddress that belongs to hte pubkey relitivly easily to allow the user to check the address is right.

[24-Oct-18 05:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe implement most usual case somehow in this call: getwalletaddress -> validateaddress -> put pubkey to -pubkey=

[24-Oct-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[24-Oct-18 05:50 AM] TonyL#3577
For example if you call `setpubkey` without params

[24-Oct-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
got ya ... will try this out .

[24-Oct-18 05:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Or some `setpubkey default`

[24-Oct-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also if given the pubkey it should generate Raddress and run validate address

[24-Oct-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to amke sure its valid before adding I think.

[24-Oct-18 05:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r Could you please show the code? Very interesting how you've implemented it (like a restarting daemon or there is a way to change it on fly)

[24-Oct-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```extern uint8_t NOTARY_PUBKEY33[];
    extern std::string NOTARY_PUBKEY;
    if ( NOTARY_PUBKEY33[0] == 0 && strlen(params[0].get_str().c_str()) == 66 ) {
        LOCK(cs_main);
        NOTARY_PUBKEY = params[0].get_str();
        decode_hex(NOTARY_PUBKEY33,33,(char *)NOTARY_PUBKEY.c_str());

    } else {
        result.push_back(Pair("error", "Can only set pubkey once, to change it you need to restart your daemon."));
    }
    result.push_back(Pair("pubkey", NOTARY_PUBKEY));
    return result;```

[24-Oct-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was pie once I knew what to look for ...

[24-Oct-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after messing with RPC calls for streamer it seemed quite simple so I just tried it ... have not done on daemon with flowing blocks and things, but everywhere in the code relating to it always checks if `NOTARY_PUBKEY33[0] != 0` 
*I think* LOCK(cs_main) should prevent wallet making tx until pubkey has been set to avoid crashes but im an not 100% sure on that.

[24-Oct-18 05:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh so looks like it's only possible to set if initial `pubkey=` was totally empty not wrong or different

[24-Oct-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.... maybe it can be changed in that case also, but I dont know what the results might be

[24-Oct-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems that if it was already set, and some things had used it.... then you change it

[24-Oct-18 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that anything could happen

[24-Oct-18 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mostly did it so you can create an address THEN set pubkey, as currently its totally stupid that you need the daemon running with -pubkey but cannot create an address without the daemon running 😂

just dont setpubkey while something is in progress

[24-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
also maybe we should require the privkey for the -pubkey be in the wallet, but not sure as there are cases where you want to run as somebody elses pubkey

[24-Oct-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why it displays ismine

[24-Oct-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it also uses LOCK

[24-Oct-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it should lock things... im not 100% sure on that though

[24-Oct-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically, you start daemon, get an address, then set pubkey there should be no reaon anyone ever tries to set it when the pubkey is in use.

[24-Oct-18 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would advise notary nodes to NEVER use that RPC call 😃

[24-Oct-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes the LOCK2 will prevent any gross violations of assumptions

[24-Oct-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but you can definitely get yourself in trouble with this one

[24-Oct-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, it should be used directly after starting daemon... thats why I made it not able to set if a pubkey has been set already.

[24-Oct-18 12:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r very cool to see that PR of yours mate! 😎 👏

👍 

[24-Oct-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah it seems useful... It started as a request for Alright on his CHAT app... and I figured being able to set it after creating an address was needed, everything I tried to make so far was just made hard because you cant do that... Spent a bit long on it, hope it proves useful.
