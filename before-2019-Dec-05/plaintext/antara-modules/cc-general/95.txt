no need to have nodes always on

or to recreate wallets, explorers, etc.

in addition to being an extremely scalable technology it is a huge time saving while simplifying protocols of compatibility

solving gateways multisig has been a bit tricky and other things have been taking time. However I think I have a way to automate the partial signatures so hopefully by next week I can get it debugged. sorry for the delay

[14-Sep-18 01:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in old version of multigateway the admins had control of the multisig wallets. 
like for btc, if there are 3 servers, 3 admins, then example 3to2 multisig address holding original btc was under these admin's control.
so in this case these 3 parties were risk.

can you please tell me how this part is secured in new gateway CC ?

[14-Sep-18 01:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I missed a lot of reading. pardon me if you answered already.

[14-Sep-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the funds still need to be secured by MofN

[14-Sep-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but MofN up to 15 is supported

[14-Sep-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
also the BTC token is protected via CC, so it can only be released when there is a validated deposit

[14-Sep-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and deposits are fully automated, no need for the multisig signers to process the deposit, the depositor can submit the gatewaysdeposit and gatewaysclaim

[14-Sep-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, best to wait for my documentation of gatewaysCC

[14-Sep-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the BTC token is protected fully by the CC, the actual BTC requires the multisig signers to safekeep the BTC

[14-Sep-18 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, will wait for gatewaysCC doc üôÇ üëç

[14-Sep-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so in older model the tokens were also managed by the actual btc multisig singers ?

[14-Sep-18 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway, not important now since we are on new... will wait for doc.

[14-Sep-18 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for answering

in the old one, the issuer usually held most of the MGW tokens and sent enough to each node to process deposits

[14-Sep-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so that entire process is eliminated and streamlined and made secure

[15-Sep-18 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
Each address has a separate address for each contract

[15-Sep-18 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
along with the contract having two addresses itself

gateways CC
gateways CC is the first CC that combines multiple CC into a single one. In order to achieve its goals, both the assets CC and the oracles CC is used, in addition to a dapp that issues regular transactions. This general approach can be used to solve quite a few different use cases, so it is important to understand how a multi-CC solution is put together. There are some tricky issues that only arise when using more than one CC at a time.

Before the implementation details, first lets understand what the gateways CC does. At a high level it is similar to the old multigateway (from NXT AE 2014), but with improvements. The basic idea is to tokenize other crypto coins (like BTC) and then use the assets CC to transact/swap against the tokenized crypto. By enforcing a 1:1 peg between a specific token and BTC and an automated deposit/withdraw mechanism, it is possible to transact in the virtual BTC without the delay or expensive txfees. Then anybody that ends up having any of the BTC token would be able to withdraw actual BTC by redeeming the token.

BTC -> deposit to special address -> receive token that represents BTC onchain
do onchain transactions with the BTC token
anybody who obtains the BTC token can redeem the token and get actual BTC in the withdraw address

[15-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
By bringing the operations onchain, it avoids the need for crosschain complications for each trade. The crosschain does still have to happen on the deposit and withdraw, but that is all. There is just one aspect that makes it not fully decentralized, which is the reliance on MofN multisig. However, with N trusted community members and a reasonable M value, it is not expected to be a big barrier. Since all operations are automated, the only trust needed is that M of the N multisig signers are running their nodes with the gateways dapp active and also that M of them wont collude to steal the funds locked in the multisig. In three years of operations, the MGW multigateway didnt have any incident of multisig signer misbehavior and it was only 2of3 multisig.

How can the gatewaysCC work? First, it needs a dedicated token that can be used to represent the external crypto coin. In order to avoid any issues with misplaced tokens, it is simplest to require that 100% of all the tokens are all locked in the gatewaysCC address. We want to make it so that the only way the tokens can be released from the locked address is when a verified deposit is made. So, we also need a deposit address, which means there needs to be a set of pubkeys that control the deposit address. It turns out, we also need to post merkleroot data from the external coin so that the information is onchain to be able to validate the external deposit. Since we are already trusting the deposit address signers to safekeep the external coins via MofN multisig, trusting them to post the merkleroots doesnt increase the trust footprint needed.

[15-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
Now we have all the ingredients needed, a dedicated token, a set of multisig pubkeys and an oracle for merkleroots.

gatewaysbind tokenid oracletxid coin tokensupply M N pubkey(s)

With a gatewaysbind, a new gateway is defined. the pubkeys are for the custodians of the multisig funds and they also need to be posting merkleroots to the chain, so the oracle needs to be setup and funded and each of the signers needs to run the oraclefeed dapp. That posts each new merkleroot via oraclesdata and also responds to withdraw requests.

The MofN pubkeys generates a deposit address and when funds are sent to that address along with a small amount to the claim address. With the txid from this external coin, along with the txproof and the rawtransaction, all is submitted with a gatewaysdeposit. This adds a special baton output which is a gateways CC output to invoke gateways validation and also prevents double claims by using the unspent status of the baton.

gatewaysdeposit bindtxid height coin cointxid claimvout deposithex proof destpub amount
gatewaysclaim bindtxid coin deposittxid destpub amount

Once the gatewaysdeposit is validated, it can be claimed and now the token is sent to the claim address. A 1:1 pegging of the external crypto to the token is established. And as long as one of the deposit address signers is running the oraclefeed, then the deposit/claim process is fully automatic and under the control of the depositor. Nothing needs to be signed by any other party! Also by using the utxo from the deposittxid, double claims are prevented.

[15-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
On the withdraw side, the tokens are sent back to the address where the tokens are locked and this needs to create a redemption right that can only be used once.

gatewayswithdraw bindtxid coin withdrawpub amount


And with a bit more magic in the oraclefeed, this is achieved. To be continued...

So you can combine something like a dice system with instant payment "channel CC" on a gambling Dapp platform with deposit/withdraw with an specific asset CC pegged on any crypto or "fiat maybe" without the delay or expensive txfees of the pegged cuurency ?

[15-Sep-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it would require extending the dice CC to bet with tokens, but that should be possible

[15-Sep-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
currently the assets CC is assuming token rpc is used, but i think all that is needed is to extend token transfer to allow other CC to do it. then all the other CC can do whatever they do using assets

[15-Sep-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
now that I am getting into multi-cc environment, i  do see the need for this more and more

[15-Sep-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the one after gateways is prices and that will definitely alllow betting via assets, so I plan to solve this issue then

[15-Sep-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure of most of you realize the true power of CC. Each CC is extending the consensus rules and in some ways every CC is the same level of utility as entire other projects. I seem to be able to do about one per week, mixed in with the other things I am doing. And now we are getting more CC devs to help out

another way to allow betting in external currencies is to make a 1:1 pegged chain, ie. the normal definition of sidechain via the gatewayCC. Then there wont be any need to be changing all the other CC and this might be the most efficient way in general

Hi! If somebody playing with oracles CCs - I've created 3 new tools in https://github.com/tonymorony/kmd_cc_qa :

1) `oracle_mass_creation.py` - creating as much oracles as you need with needed type, creating as much UTXOs as you need.  Creating 3 files:
 a) `oracles_list` (list of oracles txids) 
 b) `register_list` (list of registration txids)
 c) `subscriptions_list` (list of subscription txids)
Have to wait for mempool cleaning to run next.

2) `oracle_mass_datapublish.py` - using `oracles_list` and `data_sample` as inputs. Put data string by sting from `data_sample` to each oracle from `oracles_list`. As output creating `data_batonids` with latest `batontxid` for each oracle.
Have to wait for mempool cleaning to run next.

3) `oracle_mass_dataread.py` - using `oracles_list`, `data_batonids` and `data_sample` (just to get depth). Reading data from each oracle baton by baton and put it to files like `data_%oracletxid%`)

The first four CC: assets, faucet, rewards and dice appear to be fairly solid
The next four: oracles, gateways, channels and prices are in various stages of completion
I want to start thinking about the next four: auctions, pegs, triggers and payments

if you have any musthave functionality for the third set, plz post ideas

[17-Sep-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe there is a higher priority one that can become part of the third set

[17-Sep-18 04:50 PM] jusoaresf#3291
auctions could cover public tenders too or this would need to be a separate contract?

[17-Sep-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
what is a public tender?

[17-Sep-18 04:52 PM] jusoaresf#3291
Like a company wants to buy 50 tables and ask sellers to bid

[17-Sep-18 04:53 PM] jusoaresf#3291
like a reverse auction

[17-Sep-18 04:54 PM] jusoaresf#3291
But if it is a government (public company) buying goods or services for instance the rules would need to be public but the bids would be kept secret to the day of the "auction"

[17-Sep-18 04:55 PM] jusoaresf#3291
Concorrencia Publica in Portuguese... dont; know in English...

[17-Sep-18 04:56 PM] jusoaresf#3291

ok, i see

[17-Sep-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
secret bids is interesting

[17-Sep-18 05:06 PM] jusoaresf#3291
In these no one want the concurrency to know your hand

[17-Sep-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, secret bidding will require the buyer to come back online during a specific claiming window

[17-Sep-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but it can be done

[17-Sep-18 05:11 PM] jusoaresf#3291
yes, they wouldn't want to miss the envelopes opening (or would be disqualified)
or it could keep your oracle to keep their bid encrypted until a time X when the buyer Private key would be all that is needed to complete fulfillment?

[17-Sep-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that the entire blockchain will need to be able to decrypt

[17-Sep-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and if it had that data before time X, it would allow people to decrypt at any time

[17-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why the buyers need to come back after the deadline to post their actual price that they committed to

[17-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if they dont, they would lose their deposit

[17-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jusoaresf#3291
yes

[17-Sep-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, I will try to have secret bid auctions supported in addition to open auction

[17-Sep-18 05:14 PM] jusoaresf#3291
But what of that address where the prived key is exposed but the condition itself need to be fulfilled before anyone can decrypt despite the privkey?

[17-Sep-18 05:14 PM] jusoaresf#3291
great!

[17-Sep-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, payment can be prevented, but in such a case the price bid wont be secret

[17-Sep-18 05:16 PM] jusoaresf#3291
yes... I am mixing up tx with data encryption... üò¶

[17-Sep-18 05:17 PM] jusoaresf#3291
And are triggers like if some block chain "events" would launch Trigger CCs ?
Like reaching a block height or a specific utxo consumption for instance?
I seems I didn't get this one right...

[17-Sep-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
my high level concept for trigger is to be able to create a standardized trigger from various internal and external things, that then allows the payments CC to have a standardized event that triggers payment actions

[17-Sep-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so triggers is sort of a "connector" CC

[17-Sep-18 05:20 PM] jusoaresf#3291
hum... I better wait for when you are ready to write it in more dept üòÉ

[17-Sep-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it is still a rough concept, but something like payments CC would allow to create a payment based on an eventtxid

[17-Sep-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe the triggers CC is better named as events, but I didnt do that for some reason

[17-Sep-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
lilkely becuase there are internal blockchain events that doesnt need a CC

[17-Sep-18 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so the concept is to make a dapp with some specific control flow:
1. define the triggers
2. define the payments
3. define the frequency, min/max, etc

[17-Sep-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and the FSM would tie things together so you can define initial state, intermediate states and the final completed state
