I havent broadcast tested any of the tx to prevent forking of AT3

[15-Aug-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but at somepoint it seems we will need an AT4

[15-Aug-18 01:06 PM] SHossain#0007
AT4 Chain is up
```
./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=AT4 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -pubkey=<your_pubkey> -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &

[15-Aug-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
how long does faucetget take? it prints start and end timestamps

[15-Aug-18 01:18 PM] SHossain#0007
added some fudns to the faucet of this chain

[15-Aug-18 01:18 PM] SHossain#0007
will test now

yes, that's good

[15-Aug-18 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm also trying to get the commands coverted to insomnia.

[15-Aug-18 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
24.2 seconds latest faucetget command

[15-Aug-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
what is important is the time per 65536 iterations

[15-Aug-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
on your system it is about 15 seconds

[15-Aug-18 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will sync AT4 on a slow system and test in a second

[15-Aug-18 01:32 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. let me test on a slow system as well

[15-Aug-18 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it could take a few minutes ona slow system. this will make people reconsider putting it in blocknotify, especially as each faucetget will be a race against all the others

[15-Aug-18 01:35 PM] SHossain#0007
78 seconds in a slow system

[15-Aug-18 01:35 PM] SHossain#0007

[15-Aug-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
putting it in locknotify was definatly an exploit. What do you class as slow system?

[15-Aug-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[15-Aug-18 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@SHossain im working on insomnia commands too... if you want i can set everything up and then pass it forward

[15-Aug-18 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
whats up?

[15-Aug-18 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r  it is a VPS with 4 cores and 16GB RAM and some SSD. mining with all threads
@siu - Chainmakers it would be lovely

[15-Aug-18 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
though i have the faucet integrated in there

[15-Aug-18 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
do i update chain?

[15-Aug-18 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or are we still working on AT3?

[15-Aug-18 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
AT4

[15-Aug-18 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers next time please remove your user and pass from the json file before sharing... üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah... sorry. didnt realize it got exported too until i uploaded it

7.34 seconds this time

[15-Aug-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed another faucet change, this one prevents getting faucetget to an address with prior activity

[15-Aug-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a hardforking change

[15-Aug-18 01:48 PM] SHossain#0007
updating

[15-Aug-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[15-Aug-18 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
with this I think it makes it painful enough to get the 0,1 coins

[15-Aug-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
13s and 48s 2 timesI tried

[15-Aug-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess if the mining ROI of the faucet is mor than normal mining, people might still try to mine it

[15-Aug-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[15-Aug-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but now you need to restart the daemon for each 0.1

[15-Aug-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the main issue was that if you spam faucet it locked the deamon, if its not worth spamming the faucet then that is no issue. Restarting th deamon seems fair I think.

[15-Aug-18 01:50 PM] SHossain#0007
insomnia is also great for history of time it took

[15-Aug-18 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
of course someone really determined could make a special faucet miner, but that would just make the faucet not so useful. hopefully we dont run into this issue

[15-Aug-18 01:55 PM] SHossain#0007
anyone need balance of AT4, just use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT4 setgenerate true 1` for few minutes and then turn off mining using `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT4 setgenerate false`

[15-Aug-18 01:55 PM] SHossain#0007

funded the faucet again to see if there is any difference

[15-Aug-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the faucet has multiple UTXO you *used* to be able to claim against it more than once per block.

[15-Aug-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess with restart deemon required this wont happen now

[15-Aug-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but will test it

[15-Aug-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but now the faucetget needs to be the first txid to an address

[15-Aug-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you need a new address and -pubkey every time?

[15-Aug-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
requiring a restart of daemon to change -pubkey, yes

cool got it

[15-Aug-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
combined with 20 seconds calcs, I think people will just mine normally and not mine the faucet

[15-Aug-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the 0,1 coins become worth a lot

[15-Aug-18 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes sounds good. STAKED1 was a huge early advantage mining the faucet.

[15-Aug-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm got a faucetget in 4s

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
as usual luck happens

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
how many iterations

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
if user need unused address and pubkey and need to restart daemon each time, i guess dispensing more than 0.1 coin would be better...

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
just a thought

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure... I piped the hex directly to sendrawtx

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
otherwise, there would be too much hassle to get small amount for a normal user

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the time per 65536 iterations that matters

[15-Aug-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
second on is taking ages

[15-Aug-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt 0.1 coins enough to do stuff with?

[15-Aug-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
thinking about real coins that will enable CC contracts

[15-Aug-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think 0.1 is fine, it depsnds on chain, this amount could be changed on any chain that wanted to right?

[15-Aug-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
curently there is only one faucet plan, so it is a universal number

[15-Aug-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[15-Aug-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is 1000 txfees

[15-Aug-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
you can create assets

[15-Aug-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1m 52 for second and tx failed as I already used it

8 year old CPU.

[15-Aug-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
good, that is a good range from old to alien

[15-Aug-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
max about 50s

[15-Aug-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
with these changes, maybe faucet is ready for production use?

[15-Aug-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
takes longer than that to restart with new pubkey, you could automate that, but its unlikely to be worth it... staking 0.1 UTXO cant be done anyway

[15-Aug-18 02:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL when you have some time, please test the faucet contarct on your end using new address and pubkey each time
