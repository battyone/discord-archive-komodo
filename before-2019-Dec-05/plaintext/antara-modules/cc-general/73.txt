That's me funding ☠

[22-Aug-18 03:50 AM] Alright#0419
...and it confirmed

[22-Aug-18 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Meanwhile in daemon when generating transaction I've received `privkey for the -pubkey= address is not in the wallet, importprivkey!`

[22-Aug-18 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
But get hex output anyway

[22-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
Entropy is based on these txs, yes?

[22-Aug-18 03:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup

[22-Aug-18 03:52 AM] Alright#0419
how is mine still sitting in the mempool?

[22-Aug-18 03:52 AM] Alright#0419
seriously, 4 blocks mined since i sent it

[22-Aug-18 03:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Yours confirmed as well

[22-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
how long does it typically take for `bet still pending` to stop?

[22-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
is that based on the timeoutblocks value?

[22-Aug-18 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Sometimes 1 bet in batch stucked but in a few blocks unlocked

[22-Aug-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419

[22-Aug-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
restart with a different pubkey though

[22-Aug-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
did a bet on TONY and it's pending 5 blocks after the `dicebet` tx

[22-Aug-18 04:03 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright I guess you may be right regards `timeoutblocks` and stucking bet, my bets stucked in your dice on STAKED2 for a long time, and as I remember you have very big timeout here

[22-Aug-18 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
think it was 10 blocks on STAKED2

[22-Aug-18 04:05 AM] Alright#0419
Ah ok, TONY still worked fine

[22-Aug-18 04:05 AM] TonyL#3577
I am 😂

[22-Aug-18 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
Can we do -ac_name=☠ next? 😛

[22-Aug-18 04:11 AM] TonyL#3577
I can create token also

[22-Aug-18 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
I'm surprised no coin has used unicode in their ticker yet

[22-Aug-18 04:12 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm surprised that someone tried to do it 😃

[22-Aug-18 04:15 AM] TonyL#3577
But it allows to use Chinese and etc.

[22-Aug-18 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
we could adopt a unicode character similar to ฿

@Alright i fixed that wrong error message (should be dice but says faucet) and will submit a PR soon

[22-Aug-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright I think you can create a diceaddfund, but a dicebet that uses it should be rejected. to test this, make a new plan and create a fake entropy tx. then dicebet, the only entropy tx available is the fake one, so it should fail at the dicebet stage. which is still a bug, I should prevent the dicebet from using the fake entropy tx

[22-Aug-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL yes, there have been many projects and even ICO promising blockchained gambling, yet with 1000 lines of dice CC code, we do it first

@TonyL pretty sure you're mining to my pubkey right now

[22-Aug-18 08:05 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter, just thought I was going crazy for a minute

[22-Aug-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright aha! so there is no bug. it cant be stopped to create the addfunding as it is just a normal tx, but as long as the dicebet doesnt use them, no harm is done. of course the would be cheater will end up with funds locked that cant be unlocked

[22-Aug-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
counts towards `funding` in diceinfo

[22-Aug-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
don't see why anyone would ever do it though

[22-Aug-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
well cheating at 100:1 odds is a good financial incentive

[22-Aug-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so we need to make sure such cheating is rightly punished by locking the funds. i dont consider this a must fix bug to fix the display as it is unlikely to happen

[22-Aug-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
So, this was a false positive and I guess there are no bugs? I saw some sort of problem reported in #private-staked with spamming of dicebets. is that a reproducible problem, if so, what was the problem?

[22-Aug-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
is there a nice report of the odds >1 bet results?

[22-Aug-18 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
not sure it was actually a problem

[22-Aug-18 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
was getting spammed with this on one of my nodes while joker was testing dice 
```

[22-Aug-18 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
I got that on my personal node, but wasn't getting it on the node that funded the plan

[22-Aug-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a malformed tx, which would be a bug if normal rpc process was used

[22-Aug-18 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
Think I may have just broken every dice plan on BRK by spamming a single plan with 1 sat `diceaddfunds` from the wrong address

yea one moment

[22-Aug-18 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
this could be a bug with CC vin selection

[22-Aug-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am now getting lots of errors on dice on STAKED1, I nede to take a little time to make a proper report for it though as I was playing with a script that does all the raw TX stuff behind the scenes.

[22-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419

Doesn't seem to be the raw tx that is the problem

[22-Aug-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
both the vins are unspent?

[22-Aug-18 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
Hmm, I just deleted my BRK directory, wallet included, made a new address, funded it and did a dicebet. Got the missing inputs error, but then I tried the same exact command on my other node and it worked

[22-Aug-18 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
did it twice with a fresh node, but the node that created the plan was able to do a dicebet

[22-Aug-18 09:26 AM] Alright#0419
both inputs unspent

[22-Aug-18 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
on the node it works on, it used the same vin0 as the one it failed on

the node that creates the plan has some different codepaths

[22-Aug-18 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
Now I'm utterly confused. I deleted the wallet of the node that created, made a new pubkey and ran the same command and it worked

[22-Aug-18 09:39 AM] Alright#0419

[22-Aug-18 09:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, can I run BRK on the same server, at the same time, as STAKED2?

[22-Aug-18 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[22-Aug-18 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF once you sync, could you run this please? `./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK dicebet BORKED fd6093b89df7cbb68796ad014682641cd74fd6bdd6b3599faf1474941afe5dc9 57 1`

it'll output some hex, copy that hex and do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK sendrawtransaction <pasteHEXhere>`

[22-Aug-18 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
So with STAKED2 running I `./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=BRK -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -pubkey=<your_pubkey> -addnode=94.130.224.11` to sync?
