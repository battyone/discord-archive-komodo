Ask for a not whole supply can not fill as well

[24-Sep-18 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh nevermind I executed not correct transaction

[24-Sep-18 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
For 100 tokens it's worked as expected. So looks like `tokefillask` not works when  you trying to sell whole token supply in one order. But possible to cancel this order. Not connected to gatewaysCC at all

[24-Sep-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix for gatewaysclaim

[24-Sep-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it used to not check the claimpubkey

[24-Sep-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
now it makes sure the claimpubkey matches your pubkey, so that should prevent what happened

[24-Sep-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
strange thing is that you got an error on the node it was supposed to go to?

[24-Sep-18 03:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes I've got an error on node which supposed to claim

[24-Sep-18 03:07 PM] TonyL#3577
But no error on "illegal" node

[24-Sep-18 03:07 PM] TonyL#3577
"illegal" in spot of rights to claim depo

[24-Sep-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
next time dont broadcast the claim

[24-Sep-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
I need to reproduce it and fix it

[24-Sep-18 03:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so in test checklist:
- test of gatewayswithdraw
- re-test of gatewaysclaim process with latest fix (have to not broadcast tx if get same error for valid for claim node )

[24-Sep-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and it should fail on all nodes that arent for the claimpubkey

@jl777c just wonder how handling gatewayswithdraw cases in spot of txfee? If lets say initially were deposited 100 KMD but gatewayswithdraw using a lot of times by secondary traders. Is transaction fee spending from gateway balance? If yes on some moment might be a situation when gateways coins balance significantly not match issued tokens amount.

[25-Sep-18 04:45 AM] TonyL#3577
After secondary trading have 100 KMD tokens:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 tokenbalance 3852b3e1b24bc927758f49ded16114437ab52e5fb9afa201c47bb85e28372ea8

[25-Sep-18 04:47 AM] TonyL#3577
No luck with withdraw (tried different number pow), I think I definitely doing something wrong but don't have any printouts 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewayswithdraw 1023f2c31f8d5e06854cd8c3ef103679b8d2af2c4ba14ea16646dd2a10332c55 KMD 030cb918b90dc084cdb08fcda4297d0db9c86422987df0cafa47ffef57eb6ef647 0.0000000000000001

  "error": "couldnt gatewayswithdraw"
}
```

[25-Sep-18 04:50 AM] TonyL#3577
What is the logic for `tokencovert` execution in case of `gatewayswithdraw`? Is anybody who owns some token allowed to convert some/all tokens which belongs to him or tokens creator have to convert whole supply before each withdraw?

[25-Sep-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
tokens should never be used up for txfees, the txfees come from whoever is doing the transactions

[25-Sep-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
0.0000000000000001 that is a very suspicious number

[25-Sep-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it would end up as 0, as nothing has more precision than 0.00000001 and that is illegal param

[25-Sep-18 07:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it should be like this I guess: 100 * 10^(-8)
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewayswithdraw 1023f2c31f8d5e06854cd8c3ef103679b8d2af2c4ba14ea16646dd2a10332c55 KMD 030cb918b90dc084cdb08fcda4297d0db9c86422987df0cafa47ffef57eb6ef647 0.000001
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt gatewayswithdraw"
}
```

[25-Sep-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
let me look at the code, this is something you should do also. rpcwallet.cpp gatewayswithdraw

[25-Sep-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the 0.000001 is matching the 100 that was converted

[25-Sep-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you are doing the withdraw from the node with -pubkey= 03ea9c062b9652d8eff34879b504eda0717895d27597aaeb60347d65eed96ccb40 ?

[25-Sep-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I get printouts:
check RGT2bWyMAYGr1teAbzYXSvGhFqkuVqcXQ3 for gateway inputs
cant find enough inputs or mismatched total

[25-Sep-18 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to find the console for that instance! without console prints it is like being blind

[25-Sep-18 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
check the balance of RGT2bWyMAYGr1teAbzYXSvGhFqkuVqcXQ3 (use addressbalance)

[25-Sep-18 07:41 AM] TonyL#3577
`-pubkey=03431a95c761c491e38a891425009cff5f9eaa3aa3d3d4945dd17f3d0bfcff2590` for node on which I'm calling `gatewyswithdraw`

[25-Sep-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but you did: ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 tokenconvert 241 3852b3e1b24bc927758f49ded16114437ab52e5fb9afa201c47bb85e28372ea8 03ea9c062b9652d8eff34879b504eda0717895d27597aaeb60347d65eed96ccb40 100

[25-Sep-18 07:42 AM] TonyL#3577
I want to withdraw to other pubkey

[25-Sep-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
that converts the tokens and sends it to pubkey 03ea9c062b9652d8eff34879b504eda0717895d27597aaeb60347d65eed96ccb40

[25-Sep-18 07:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Ohh

[25-Sep-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so now the assets are in that pubkey

[25-Sep-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
do a tokenbalance to make sure

[25-Sep-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry addressbalance

[25-Sep-18 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
It's a  "GatewaysPubkey"

[25-Sep-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont own the tokens you cant withdraw them, for obvious reasons

[25-Sep-18 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Shouldn't I convert to GatewaysPubkey before performing the withdrawal?

[25-Sep-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont mind random strangers on the internet racing to do the withdraw for those tokens

[25-Sep-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be a cool game

[25-Sep-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you want to keep your tokens, it is best to convert to your own pubkey and then withdraw from that pubkey

[25-Sep-18 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
this is an extra step that was added due to the need for enforcement of gateways validation rules

[25-Sep-18 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Got the concept now. Bye bye 100 tokens

[25-Sep-18 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
well i think they are still there

[25-Sep-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you could start an instance with -pubkey=<gatewayspubkey> but that probably gets into the territory of breaking things and is for after things are working stable, ie. the trying to break it phase

[25-Sep-18 07:46 AM] TonyL#3577
It's worth to pay 100 tokens to not get this scary place atm

[25-Sep-18 07:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to withdraw with correct convert

[25-Sep-18 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577

[25-Sep-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
for now maybe you can start making automated stuff to help make this a more sane process

[25-Sep-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
from deposit

[25-Sep-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
and you are doing withdraw from -pubkey= 030cb918b90dc084cdb08fcda4297d0db9c86422987df0cafa47ffef57eb6ef647 node?

[25-Sep-18 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, sounds like a very good idea. Anyway have to doublecheck it

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope, from this one `-pubkey=03431a95c761c491e38a891425009cff5f9eaa3aa3d3d4945dd17f3d0bfcff2590`

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I'm able to convert

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
But not able to withdraw I guess

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Because now it's not on my pubkey

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but you converted to 030cb918b90dc084cdb08fcda4297d0db9c86422987df0cafa47ffef57eb6ef647

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
now 030cb918b90dc084cdb08fcda4297d0db9c86422987df0cafa47ffef57eb6ef647 owns them

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a convert and transfer

[25-Sep-18 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes I want to allow let's say my customer to withdraw

[25-Sep-18 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a SPV model

[25-Sep-18 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
So now I have to claim withdraw from `pubkey= 030cb918b90dc084cdb08fcda4297d0db9c86422987df0cafa47ffef57eb6ef647`

[25-Sep-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure where these customers came from, for now you are converting to different pubkey and so cant withdraw

[25-Sep-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
only the one that owns the coins can withdraw

[25-Sep-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
tokenconvert changes who owns it

[25-Sep-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you send to your own pubkey

[25-Sep-18 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
So in theory I should able to gatewayswithdraw these 100 tokens now from node with pubkey= 030cb918b90dc084cdb08fcda4297d0db9c86422987df0cafa47ffef57eb6ef647 ?

[25-Sep-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-Sep-18 08:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, let me rebuild komodod on these node from latest and test (can take a while since this node is Macbook air :trollface: )

[25-Sep-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
or can just convert another 100 tokens

[25-Sep-18 08:24 AM] TonyL#3577
All fun killed :/

[25-Sep-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you can recover the KMD as it is controlled by single address. just for testing, so dont do KMD tx from that same pubkey that is the gateway deposit address

[25-Sep-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
I think on the automation side, it would be possible to make the gatewaysdeposit and gatewaysclaim be able to be done by anybody as it is hardcoded into the cointxid where the funds must end up. so the users would only have to do the sendmany and then automatically the tokens appear. I will look into adding this automated deposit processing into oraclefeed. however we need to make sure there is a way to manually process any deposits that are missed by oraclefeed

[25-Sep-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
ultimately it should be user makes cointxid using sendmany, tokens appear. for withdraw a similar process of doing a redeem of token and the rest should be automatically processed now

[25-Sep-18 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Sounds clear - I'll just ask params for sendmany with explanation. Then ask let's say how many they want to withdraw and convert it, hardcode the needed pubkey and claim gatewaywithdraw with some notification if it's not evaluated automatically by node in some period of time

[25-Sep-18 08:32 AM] TonyL#3577
All these `gettxoutproof` and `getrawtransaction` will grab automatically so should be quite easy to operate if compare with manual playing

[25-Sep-18 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Can log everything also to separate files

[25-Sep-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i guess that is the next step of automation. really it is best to be done on the user node

[25-Sep-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr no known bugs at the moment, withdraw needs to be tested
