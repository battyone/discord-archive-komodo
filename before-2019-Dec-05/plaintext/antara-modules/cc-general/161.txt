its a copy paste

[17-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah it‚Äôs mutable transaction

[17-Mar-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the transaction class is defined in transation.h I think it is ...

[17-Mar-19 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I dont do things properly... but its all in the code, you juist nede to find it

[17-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Mylo#8306
mtx is the variable used when constructing by the naming convention.  It could have been called cat or dog, but it‚Äôs not.

[17-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Mylo#8306
It‚Äôs easy to know once these conventions are established

[17-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Mylo#8306
As per your ‚Äúknow the structs‚Äù stmt

[17-Mar-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`CCinclude.h` will be my referance point. 
Yes. Pretty much... My code doesnt usually follow such things, but im getting better at it. 
For me, you find all the relavent structs and classes, note where they are or open them all... then start making stuff. 
Once you know whats contained in what things are fairly simple to make.

[17-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Mylo#8306
When you see mtx, you go into mutable transaction construction reading code mode

[17-Mar-19 03:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah they are sprinkled around the place üòÉ

[17-Mar-19 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is the hardest part. Documenting that would help people get started 1000x faster

[17-Mar-19 03:09 AM] Mylo#8306
You read my doc yet üòú

[17-Mar-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes using 2 letter names for things is fine when your going fast and you wrote it...

[17-Mar-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but for someone else ... its difficult to use

[17-Mar-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

dpow info pointer

[17-Mar-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
block info pointer

[17-Mar-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a convention i use, have a struct that is XYZ_info, then pointers to that is *xp

[17-Mar-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so add three lines of comments to make it obvious to others

[17-Mar-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and calling a transaction tx, that actually seems ok, along with txid being transaction id

[17-Mar-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
It is the C++-ness of things that makes all the structs hard to find. for iguana most all the structs are in iguana_structs.h

[17-Mar-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I like having all the structs in one place

[17-Mar-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes once I found them it was easy

[18-Mar-19 12:52 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Is KMD changing to a 50% PoW 50% PoS consensus ?

[18-Mar-19 12:53 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Says so on the website under currently in development and testing

[18-Mar-19 12:58 AM] Alright#0419
@Mr.Cryptodude where?

[18-Mar-19 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
It's likely a confusion between a feature upstreamed from VRSC which allows for 50/50 verushash/veruspos chains

[18-Mar-19 12:59 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ah ye I just realized it

[18-Mar-19 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
that is a feature for assetchains, nothing to do with KMD itself

[21-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
new payments CC in #cc-payments. it was conceived of and all the rpc calls implemented today. there was a stub for it for a long time, never had quite the right usecase for it

[22-Mar-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
made gamescc based on customcc, for now it just has a blockhash based rng, but it will evolve to support locking funds and paying out based on game results. #cc-games

[27-Mar-19 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Managed to make my first CC with custom CC... very very simple one. Burns coins and submits chain params to the CC cntract allowing to retreive them later. 
Basically just send the chain params as the only argument for the RPC, and it extracts the supply checks if over minimum amount and tehn creates a tx to teh unspendable CC address. Validation is simple return false, as the coins are never allowed to be spent. 
May need to be combined with oracles, to be useful for LABS chain creation üòÉ

[27-Mar-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well it does the burn tx fine. Need some more RPCs to finish it off and get the data back out, but thats the easy part.

hi, when working with cc, do I have to run 2 nodes as well ?

[28-Mar-19 10:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Pinned a message.

[28-Mar-19 10:40 PM] TonyL#3577
@PHBA2061 Hi! If you want to create your assetchain - yes you need at least two nodes.
Also you can use CC test blockchain:
```./komodod -ac_name=TXSCLCC -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &```

[29-Mar-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I worked out at least at a high level how to make LUA scripts for a CC code... not sure how useful it would be ... it could speed up testing code though as you can update the script then just run the RPC again without having to recompile and restarrt. 
I think though to make anything actually useful could turn into a massive task.

[29-Mar-19 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Using external scripts for consensus code is ovbiously a bad idea... But that said to just mess with the CC's by writing LUA scripts  could help people understand how they work better. I think there would be maybe 20-30 functions inside the code that need a wrapper to be able to be used inside the scripts. Not sure if this is anything anyone wants. Just an idea I had.

[29-Mar-19 03:41 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I have 2 questions 
1) When running the command 
`./komodod -ac_name=TXSCLCC -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &`
Do I need to inlcude my pubkey as well ? 
2) I was following the Smart Contract Test Plan in the min message , when running the command 
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC dicelist` 
it returns a null array, which means there are currently no dice contract deployed on the TXSCLCC ac ?

[29-Mar-19 03:43 PM] SHossain#0007
you can either use `-pubkey=0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` on the chain start command or use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setpubkey 0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` after the chain has started.

[29-Mar-19 03:44 PM] SHossain#0007
almost similar way like this https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game#step-1---start-the-chain

@SHossain  thank you, that's what I just did then üòÉ  , and about the 2nd question , it doesn't return 
`[

]`
as stated in the google document, I'm not sure it's just me or it's the same for other nodes üòÇ

[29-Mar-19 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007
did you create a new dice plan on TXSCLCC?

[29-Mar-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
are you fully synced?

[29-Mar-19 04:02 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I see, my komodo data is not fully synced yet, till now I was working only with my own test chain, so there's no need to sync, thank you üòÉ

@blackjok3r sounds interesting,

[30-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Mylo#8306
any wrappers for validation would help just to speed up testing time maybe

[30-Mar-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm thinking that maybe its an easy way for testing validation as we can change the RPC calls in runtime to test all attack vectors very fast

[30-Mar-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That said it may he more work to make it than its worth lol

[31-Mar-19 10:21 PM] Regnar#6164
Looking at the docs for Dilithium it says "The Dilithium CC allows for quantum resistant transactions on any Komodo assetchain that supports it." does this mean Dilithium signatures or the "Q" addresses aren't available for KMD?

[01-Apr-19 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
Not available on KMD. Might be available on KMDCC later this year. Whether or not it'll be on KMDCC is a question for jl

[01-Apr-19 03:17 AM] Regnar#6164
is KMDCC fungible with KMD?

[01-Apr-19 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
@Regnar yes

[01-Apr-19 03:23 AM] Regnar#6164
fungible as in KMD can move to KMDCC at a 1 for 1 rate, burned on one, created on another.

[01-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
Not burned, held in a gateway I believe. Don't know the full details though, I could be wrong

[01-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Regnar#6164
that works too. I'm not sure on the best way to do it, just wondering if people buying and holding KMD will have the benefits of many of the CC tech that will be on KMDCC, or if they will have to mine/buy a different coin all together.

[01-Apr-19 03:26 AM] Regnar#6164
They're different chains obviously, these questions I think a pretty unique to Komodo's situation so I figured they are worth asking

[01-Apr-19 03:27 AM] Regnar#6164
interchangeable

[01-Apr-19 03:28 AM] Regnar#6164
Right that's what I figured, KMD as a chain isn't implementing these CCs, other chains can build with them, including KMDCC

[01-Apr-19 03:36 AM] Regnar#6164
Where can I find information on the difference between KMD and KMDCC, is there an explorer for KMDCC? chain params to run it in Komodod? is it being mined separately from KMD?

[01-Apr-19 03:36 AM] Regnar#6164
Or am I misunderstanding KMDCC?

[01-Apr-19 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
KMDCC doesn't exist yet, eta is Q2

[01-Apr-19 03:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Difference is z-addresses support and some CCs activated

[01-Apr-19 03:56 AM] TonyL#3577
`is it being mined separately from KMD?` - I wonder yes, since its assetchain

[01-Apr-19 04:05 AM] Regnar#6164
That sounds like it won't be fungible with KMD?

[01-Apr-19 04:12 AM] TonyL#3577
1:1 KMD <-> KMDCC gateway planned

[01-Apr-19 04:12 AM] TonyL#3577
So it'll be fungible with KMD

[01-Apr-19 04:13 AM] Regnar#6164
that's good to hear. I was hoping I wouldn't have to choose between cool KMDCC and KMD as an investment.

[01-Apr-19 04:14 AM] Regnar#6164
I would assume Dilithium would make it to KMD though eventually

[01-Apr-19 04:15 AM] Regnar#6164
seeing as that seems much more security related than other CCs

[01-Apr-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
KMDCC to use the CC denominated in KMD

[01-Apr-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
1:1 automated multisig gateway will exist to allow fungibility between the two

[01-Apr-19 12:30 PM] Regnar#6164
Good to know, thanks.
