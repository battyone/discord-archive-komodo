@TonyL 

Before you gave the recent extras, I went through the tutorial and cleaned it up.

Can you please read and verify? I will add the other information/rpc calls soon.

[16-Nov-18 10:59 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus Do you have some draft where is possible to left the comments for this doc?

Great üëç , made a little PR for this gateways guide @Bryan_Beus

Mempool checking for previous `oraclessubscribe` transaction before sending next one helped to not miss part of expected transactions.
So gateway creation part of tui seems complete and not buggy atm. Would be great if someone will try to create different gateways with it

[17-Nov-18 10:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying to repair unit tests for dice on latest FSM. But facing very strange behaviour atm.
I'm placing 10 bets in test and every time getting win result (most of the time it's refund)
1 strange thing is that I'm getting refund for more than in half of bets and never getting loss
2 strange thing is that  on refund sometimes `"won": 0.0998`, sometimes  `"won": 0.0999`
3 strange thing that on bet of 1 coin sometimes I'm getting : ` {"status": "win", "won": 0.00029998, "result": "success"}` what is totally confusing

[17-Nov-18 10:59 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm broadcasting a bet, mining a block with it, then broadcasting dicefinish, mining a block with it, then calling dicestatus and only after it broadcasting next bet

[17-Nov-18 11:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL very interesting. My suggestion is to break down things into "this is probably a bug in the test" versus "this is probably a change in behavior"

[17-Nov-18 11:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL why is the response `{"status": "win", "won": 0.00029998, "result": "success"} ` totally confusing? I have been out of the loop a bit üòÉ

[17-Nov-18 11:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Test doing nothing special in this place, just `dicebet ["LUCKY", "9f0df07668e9050bf80b11394fd012f50c694630c9a27ca211953127b0926336", "1", "2"]`

[17-Nov-18 11:04 PM] TonyL#3577
It's totally confusing because I'm betting 1 coin, not even sure in which cases I can get back 0.00029998

[17-Nov-18 11:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think i wrote these tests originally, but a lot has been changing

[17-Nov-18 11:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
the tests may be making assumptions that are no longer true

[17-Nov-18 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
or, the tests may have been fragile. They depended too much on each other, and now one change makes all the tests after that fail

[17-Nov-18 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
try to find the very first thing that fails, concentrate on that. All other failures could be caused by the first "bad test" or "no longer correct" assumption

[17-Nov-18 11:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
"never getting a loss" could maybe be related to lack of entropy

[17-Nov-18 11:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Thing above is what's fails @dukeleto 
Before I've placed 10 bets, counted wins and loses to check if balanace changing correct and it's worked because I've received "loss" or "win" of bet amount * odds+1

[17-Nov-18 11:09 PM] TonyL#3577
I've repaired most of the places before, such as a new rule of at least 100 entropy transactions for bets placing and disabling of odds 1

[17-Nov-18 11:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to repeat it manually, I think problem maybe is that dealer and player nodes are the same in test

[17-Nov-18 11:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe re-worked dice not expecting such case

[17-Nov-18 11:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL do you mean that it would be better to have 2 nodes in the test, one a dealer and the other all the players?

[17-Nov-18 11:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
is there new code that is sensitive to that?

[17-Nov-18 11:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
it may be time to split things up, do we still have all CC tests in one file?

[17-Nov-18 11:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, all CC tests are in one file atm

[17-Nov-18 11:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think such separation needed anyway - 1 node for dealer (creating/funding plan), 2 node for player - placing bets

[17-Nov-18 11:25 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto Is it ok to separate tests as a classes to files like a dice.py and run in cryptoconditions.py `run_tests` as a dice.run_dice_tests() or better to have separate run_tests in each file and run it like a `PYTHON_DEBUG=1  qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh dice --tracerpc` ?

[17-Nov-18 11:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL does only the dice tests need 2 nodes, or will other CC's benefit from having 2 nodes?

[17-Nov-18 11:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL i am leaning towards having cryptoconditions_dice.py, cryptoconditions_oracle.py, one test file per contract type

[17-Nov-18 11:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL do the nodes need different config/CLI arguments, or can they be the same config?

[17-Nov-18 11:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
we can keep cryptoconditions.py, the original test file. New tests for each contract type, go in a dedicated file for each. That keeps things simple

[18-Nov-18 12:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto at the moment seems only dice need additional nodes - in future gateways CC tests will need multiply nodes as well

[18-Nov-18 12:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems additional node will make faucet tests easier as well

[18-Nov-18 01:29 AM] TonyL#3577
I think same config is ok

[18-Nov-18 01:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL ok, it sounds like all tests can inherit a setup with 2 nodes, and then each CC test can decide how to use each node

[18-Nov-18 01:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a more realistic test environment as well, some errors/bugs cannot be found by doing everything on the same node

[18-Nov-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL FSM branch has a massive amount of new code to support sapling. please make sure all the CC are still working as well as they used to

[18-Nov-18 06:25 PM] SHossain#0007
here who is running the CCNG chain on their node?

[18-Nov-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
likely no one

[18-Nov-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
I had the seed nodes

[18-Nov-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
killed them, if you need something from it, I'll put them up

[18-Nov-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise, just use another chain as it was spammed to hell

[18-Nov-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
oracleslist, dicelist, etc

[18-Nov-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
all spammed like crazy

[18-Nov-18 06:32 PM] SHossain#0007
i still have 2 nodes running CCNG. will DM you

[18-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
you need to do `oraclesregister` then `oraclessubscribe` to fund it

Use jl777 branch

[18-Nov-18 11:34 PM] Alright#0419
don't expect FSM to work at all right now

[19-Nov-18 01:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok.

[19-Nov-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but im using dev branch and still cant get oracles to publish

[19-Nov-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 branch

[19-Nov-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
is not dev branch

[19-Nov-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 is the old FSM

[19-Nov-18 01:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, let me try with jl777 then.

[19-Nov-18 04:00 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto am I understand correct that to add the new node I just have to change this param https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/qa/rpc-tests/cryptoconditions.py#L33
Then add addr1, pubkey1, privkey1 and add one more entry in `nodes` extra_args and then operate with second node as `nodes[1]`?

Also is it enough to declare new test file here https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh#L13 ?

@TonyL Yes and yes

[19-Nov-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL tho it hasn't been tested to start 2 nodes in regest, there could be gremlins

[19-Nov-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL in fact, i believe there are some gremlins, which is why I didn't go further at the time

[19-Nov-18 06:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you see how the ports are hard-coded at https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/qa/rpc-tests/cryptoconditions.py#L46 ?

[19-Nov-18 06:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
instead of using the python lib 2 start 2 nodes for you, i would manually start the 2 nodes with your own `setup_network` for now

[19-Nov-18 06:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
the python test library doesn't fully understand how to spin up N nodes and know the correct port numbers for them

[19-Nov-18 06:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is related to AC's having a specific port combination, based on the AC name

[19-Nov-18 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
so REGTEST AC always has the same port, which is why that hack works in our test suite, to know the rpcport ahead of time. The zcash test infra we inherited, the test suite tells the node which ports to use.

[19-Nov-18 06:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL we could have REGTEST and REGTEST2 AC's, and then you could put in the fixed ports that REGTEST2 would have

[19-Nov-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL so `extra_args`, which is currently of length 1, would become an array of length 2, the second entry would be REGTEST2 values, with `self.num_nodes=2`, that might work

[19-Nov-18 08:12 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto Hmm, thanks - understood the idea in general but have to try to be sure I understood it üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 08:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL trying is the best way to learn. give it a try and i can help you if you get stuck and/or review the PR

[19-Nov-18 08:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
my time is limited right now, i won't be able to work on it myself, but I can advise you

[19-Nov-18 08:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, thanks for all your help @dukeleto üôå

[19-Nov-18 08:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL and to explain, if it's not clear, `extra_args` is an array of arrays, and each array is the extra arguments added to that nodes startup `komodod`, in addition to whichever are added by default. Currently it's only specifying the args for one node, and we want to update that and specify the extra_args for 2 nodes

[19-Nov-18 08:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
make the -ac_name of the new node REGTEST2, and then specify the p2p+rpc ports of REGTEST2, leave everything else the same

[19-Nov-18 08:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
that has a reasonable chance of working üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 08:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's time somebody else understood these internals üòâ

[19-Nov-18 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Aren't the nodes will be on different chains in such case?

[19-Nov-18 09:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmm, maybe that was the gremlins üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 09:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
in that case, we need to over-ride rpc/p2p port, correctly, and maybe that is where I stopped

[19-Nov-18 09:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is confusing stuff, i went deep into making the ZEC test suite work on KMD

[19-Nov-18 09:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC has no asset chains

[19-Nov-18 09:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
so KMD asset chains are a complexity the original code was never designed for

[19-Nov-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just did the smallest amount of work to "make it work" for a single node and single asset chain

[19-Nov-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
the "better" solution is to teach our test infra how to really manage this stuff, but in the mean-time, we need a slightly-less-bad solution

[19-Nov-18 09:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL try using the same ac_name, but diff rpc ports

[19-Nov-18 09:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
there may be some bugs, but that use should "work", in an ideal world. The internals may need to learn some stuff

[19-Nov-18 09:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is no way that our tests know how to calculate the correct RPC port for a random AC, but if we use REGTEST, it's known

[19-Nov-18 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll try, maybe have to catch ports on fly via getinfo ü§î

[19-Nov-18 09:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can't call getinfo if you don't know the correct rpc port üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 09:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
everything breaks

[19-Nov-18 09:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
you need 2 nodes

[19-Nov-18 09:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
each need their own set of p2p/rpc ports

[19-Nov-18 09:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
one can use the defaults, the other needs them specified, somehow

[19-Nov-18 09:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the core of the problem

[19-Nov-18 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, I see

[19-Nov-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a way to calculate the rpc port
