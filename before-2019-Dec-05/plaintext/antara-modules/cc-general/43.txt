?

[13-Aug-18 12:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just the printouts from my node regarding the swap

[13-Aug-18 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c read above about `tokenfillask` turning a `tokenask` order into `tokenfillask`

[13-Aug-18 07:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
has anybody gotten `rewardsunlock` to work recently?

[13-Aug-18 07:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
some of the error checking about minseconds and if the reward is > txfee makes it challenging to test. I must set mindays=0 in the test suite, and I think maybe it's failing because less than txfee has accrued before my test runs

[13-Aug-18 07:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
going to sleep and think on this

[13-Aug-18 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i read the discussion about tokenfillask but not sure what the issue is

[13-Aug-18 08:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c i posted an ask for 12300 tokens. @Alright partially filled it

[13-Aug-18 08:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
After he partially filled it, the (s) became a (S). Is this expected behaviour?

[13-Aug-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[13-Aug-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the S has the fraction amount that was unfilled and no assets were lost

[13-Aug-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
S with assets left looks a lot like an s, just that it is a remainder of a partial fill

[13-Aug-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so no actual bug, just confusion over what was supposed to happen?

[13-Aug-18 09:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes... my thought too

[13-Aug-18 09:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Alright was wondering why it happened. But my guess is that since its a partial fill and a new utxo gets formed, then status changes to (S)

[13-Aug-18 09:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so no bug to chase there.

[13-Aug-18 09:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I did get the dicefunding goes to 0 issues again though

[13-Aug-18 09:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
betting from the same node as the dicedund

[13-Aug-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
any troubles if not betting from the same node as did the dicefund?

[13-Aug-18 09:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im testing that today

[13-Aug-18 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and can you find where the dice rfunds ended up? just need the last dicebet transaction before it couldnt find it

[13-Aug-18 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it must have gotten lost due to the last one that worked

[13-Aug-18 09:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this one was a first try on that session

no, it is an overly strict error checking. i will try to reproduce

it is definitely a bug, the unlock rpc should not create a tx that doesnt validate

[13-Aug-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
how many times to I have to repeat that without the rawtx, a report that " i did X and Y happened" doesnt allow me to fix it

once a bug is created, then let me duplicate it and fix it

[13-Aug-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
you can make new plans for other bugs

[13-Aug-18 10:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok... ill take a shot at reproducing it again now

[13-Aug-18 10:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ill forget about different node testing

[13-Aug-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say that

[13-Aug-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
what I am saying is this is inefficient

[13-Aug-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
now you have to reproduce the bug that was already there

[13-Aug-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no reason many diceplans cant exist at the same time and in fact it is a good test to make sure we dont have cross plan bugs

[13-Aug-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can test the different node testing on a new plan

[13-Aug-18 10:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes... im going to replicate the bug now to have all the data first

[13-Aug-18 10:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then after i got that for you, ill test different nodes with different plan

[13-Aug-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, great. pretty sure there are more than this lost funds bugs left

explorer looks broken

[13-Aug-18 10:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like there was a hard fork change

[13-Aug-18 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[13-Aug-18 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
@Alright please update your seed and mining nodes

[13-Aug-18 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers what block you are in now?

[13-Aug-18 11:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
stuck at 2219

[13-Aug-18 11:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think i need to reindex

[13-Aug-18 11:03 AM] SHossain#0007
let's do that. i'll try my node as well

[13-Aug-18 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
back at 2231

[13-Aug-18 11:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
now im good

[13-Aug-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
any CC validation change is a consensus change, that is why it is extremely critical we find any and all bugs, sooner than later and the clock is ticking for 1 million update. currently CC testing is all that remains and it needs to be finished soon or I will have to disable the contracts that are not fully tested

[13-Aug-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
as of now, I am not even sure how many bugs there are

[13-Aug-18 11:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That i can name, we have the winning dicebet bug, and the rewards not accruing correctly

[13-Aug-18 11:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
those are the most critial bugs i know of.

[13-Aug-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
what rewards not accruing correctly bug? I have not seen that one

[13-Aug-18 11:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Alright is the one working on it

[13-Aug-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean the one I just fixed?

[13-Aug-18 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
might be. yes.

[13-Aug-18 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
need to test that again.

[13-Aug-18 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the problem with rewards is that to test it you need 24h

[13-Aug-18 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
at least

[13-Aug-18 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
why?

[13-Aug-18 11:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
because you lock funds and need at least 24h to unlock them

[13-Aug-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
why?

[13-Aug-18 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
minimum can be set to 0

[13-Aug-18 11:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok
