[07-Aug-18 04:41 PM] Alright#0419
It did unlock a previous `rewardslock`

[07-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT1 rewardsunlock over10k fa2501e6d7ae5de7a4c21f237457654af51e979a6b2e34c9f582dc7eac79a49e completelygarbagedata` worked fine too

[07-Aug-18 04:53 PM] Alright#0419
seems I just unlocked 1 node's `rewardslock` from another node

[07-Aug-18 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain @siu - Chainmakers do either of you have a `rewardslock` currently? I want to try to unlock it

[07-Aug-18 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if the locktxid is null then it picks the first one

[07-Aug-18 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody should be able to unlock any locked txid

[07-Aug-18 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
completelygarbage probably just parsed to null txid

[07-Aug-18 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if you send in a valid txid that isnt a locked txid it should make an error

[07-Aug-18 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
A little bit confused why anyone can unlock any locked txid

[07-Aug-18 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't have any locked funds on this chain yet

[07-Aug-18 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
by spamming `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT1 rewardsunlock FREE 1538ed0463d881660a76a47b3a46ea5d93dafb90fc7340a1c5162e4fe04fa009 $garbage` It seems I'm unlocking txs from other rewards plans

[07-Aug-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to allow rewards plans via SPV

[07-Aug-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
that allows a "server" node to unlock all the rewards

[07-Aug-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this is explained in comments at the top of rewards.cpp

[07-Aug-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
since the unlock address is constrained to being the address specified by whoever locked it, it doesnt seem to matter much that anybody can unlock any matured locked reward

[07-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
`minseconds 86400 maxseconds 172800
duration 159812 (1533662263 - 1533502451) numblocks 2638 (7995 - 5357)
amount 100.00000000 10000000000.00000000 317 -> duration.159812 reward 0.00506760` This reward is off I think

[07-Aug-18 05:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dont have locked funds either

[07-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
Plan had 10000% APR

[07-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
locked 100 for a little more than a day

[07-Aug-18 05:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the last ones i had printed that i had already spent the funds

[07-Aug-18 05:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

and `rewardunlock` can unlock other plan's `rewardlock`s. I just created a brand new plan and did `rewardunlock` on it and it released txs from a different plan. 
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT1 rewardsunlock 1all 677c8d8e02fb20a0fbd4cc23ab6282f5c56f03bb4f72736391eaeedd22181615 garbage`

[07-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
That^ released a tx on that over10k plan

[07-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes rewards can be unlocked by anybody, so it seems no point to restrict it to plans

[07-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
10000% APR likely overflowed, probably I will need to add a cap to rewards percentage

[07-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure where the APR overflow starts

[07-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
Not sure if this matters all that much, but you can create 2 or more plans with the same name if you create them in the same block.

[07-Aug-18 06:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
the test suite wants to create it's own foo.conf for the test komodod, but with an AC we want to use the auto-generated one, which has the correct rpc user/pass/etc

[07-Aug-18 06:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
this caused some issues, because the name of an AC determines it's port by default (REGTEST always gets 64368), but the inherited code wanted to use a randomized port and also had different rpc user/pass

@jl777c can you explain what this means please for `rewardsunlock` 
`vin.1+: funding CC vout.0 from 'F' and 'A' and 'U'`

[07-Aug-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
vins1, 2, 3, .... (however many) are all 'F' 'A' or 'U' outputs

[07-Aug-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
all the vout.0 from the 'F' 'A' 'U' are the CC outputs

[07-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
I'm looking at a `rewardsunlock` tx, and the vin1 seems to be from a different rewards plan. Is that expected?

[07-Aug-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be a bug

[07-Aug-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
is this where 2 plans confirmed the same block?

[07-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Alright#0419

[07-Aug-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it would have 'over10k' in the opreturn data

Ah, forget what I said. It has FREE in it. Good to know how to check for that now

[07-Aug-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419

[07-Aug-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the fundingtxid should also be in it

[07-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
so I assumed it was from a different plan

[07-Aug-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
for unlock, any valid CC vout can be spent

[07-Aug-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
there are the CC vouts to the rewardsCCaddress

[07-Aug-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
which pays for the rewards

[07-Aug-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the principal comes back from original locked deposit

[07-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Alright#0419
Did you see what I said about the faucet contract btw? A miner can censor faucetget txs other than their own, so the faucet essentially becomes a second coinbase at that point

[07-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Alright#0419
if you mine the block, you are guaranteed to get the faucet that block

@jl777c when I give `tokenaddress` a pubkey it gives me an additional key `CCaddress` back, when no pubkey given, it's not there. Is this expected?
