they are a special case as they can change the rules as needed

[16-Aug-18 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, like Block Producers in EOS

[16-Aug-18 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
did we abandon AT4?

[16-Aug-18 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or do we keep testing that one?

[16-Aug-18 12:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm not using AT4

[16-Aug-18 12:27 PM] SHossain#0007
now on ATX

[16-Aug-18 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c is there any validation in place for pubkey?

[16-Aug-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
some basic error check, ie. length

[16-Aug-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems latest change is good, but likely it is hardforking to AT4

[16-Aug-18 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
just ovservation
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ATX tokenbalance deadbeef deadbeef
{
  "result": "success",
  "CCaddress": "RGKRjeTBw4LYFotSDLT6RWzMHbhXri6BG6",
  "tokenid": "deadbeef",
  "balance": 0
}
```

[16-Aug-18 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ATX tokencreate Token a
{
  "error": "invalid parameter"
}
```

[16-Aug-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
well deadbeef is valid hex

[16-Aug-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and its true that balance is 0

[16-Aug-18 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. makes sense.

[16-Aug-18 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is there a way to set new pubkey running in a node without restart?

[16-Aug-18 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
nope

[16-Aug-18 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
created exactly same token as @siu - Chainmakers 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ATX tokeninfo 4d8f3c05e823c56c2561a49e78ecf001cdc88adad025273cae31740a33b3ab3f

  "tokenid": "4d8f3c05e823c56c2561a49e78ecf001cdc88adad025273cae31740a33b3ab3f",

  "name": "WEED",
  "supply": 420000000,
  "description": "Pass the dutchy to the left hand side"
}
```

[16-Aug-18 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
same name, description, supply

[16-Aug-18 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not same owner

[16-Aug-18 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
except the owner and tokenid

[16-Aug-18 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but sound scammy to me :p

[16-Aug-18 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that aint the real WEED!

[16-Aug-18 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, that was my point to ask you to create one

[16-Aug-18 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
people can create fake tokens and scam people

[16-Aug-18 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i think this is like that in ETH too and other token implementations im not wrong

[16-Aug-18 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
we need to prevent that somehow?

[16-Aug-18 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
or, can we prevent this?

[16-Aug-18 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c is the one that should know

[16-Aug-18 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
My WEED is real. Your one is FAKE! :trollface:

[16-Aug-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and not the same tokenid, which is what is actually used

[16-Aug-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if we made names unique, it would allow squatting.

[16-Aug-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the issuer of the asset is critical. the tokenid

[16-Aug-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
not the name

[16-Aug-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
i remember someone created fake SUPERNET token on NXT

[16-Aug-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
feels long ago though üòÉ

[16-Aug-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Aug-18 12:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how was it handled?

[16-Aug-18 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
people had to learn that the asset id was what mattered, not the name

[16-Aug-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
or at least the issuing account

[16-Aug-18 12:58 PM] SHossain#0007
be back after some food.

[16-Aug-18 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im going to be out for some time too

[16-Aug-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be like locking funds in a reward plan without funds

[16-Aug-18 01:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can tokens be burned? how?

[16-Aug-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the same way you burn a coin?

[16-Aug-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how do you give proof about a burning address being a real burning address?

[16-Aug-18 01:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPVMY 
is the only burn adress I know of

[16-Aug-18 01:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
it's the null priv key

[16-Aug-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is the only way to burn assets

[16-Aug-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
unless there is a bug. every satoshi for assets are supposed to be preserved

[16-Aug-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so a burn address is an address with no pubkey?

[16-Aug-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sorry, privkey

[16-Aug-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Aug-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
all 0 is invalid privkey so you cant sign using it

[16-Aug-18 01:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but then youll need to move the underlying coins to the burn address instead of the tokens?

[16-Aug-18 01:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
since there is no pubkey for that address

[16-Aug-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[16-Aug-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean "underlying coins"?

[16-Aug-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the tokens are the underlying coins

[16-Aug-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
each token satoshi comes from the original supply

[16-Aug-18 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If i want to burn a token, what should i do?

[16-Aug-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
transfer to all 0's pubkey

[16-Aug-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it should work but havent verified it

[16-Aug-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
It would end up having a different CC address than the normal burn address

[16-Aug-18 01:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[16-Aug-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but the CC vout would have all 0's in the pubkey

[16-Aug-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess you can also send it to the assets CC address. i think once it gets there, it cant be spent as it wont be associated with a sell

[16-Aug-18 02:36 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm back

[16-Aug-18 02:42 PM] SHossain#0007
the last update fixed the invalid command issues

[16-Aug-18 02:43 PM] SHossain#0007
all of those invalid commands now returns
```
{
  "error": "invalid parameter"
}
```

[16-Aug-18 02:44 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c should we go back to AT5 or continue testing on ATX?

[16-Aug-18 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a new PR coming soon, with lots of tests and error checking

i really need to make these tests run faster, 2 minutes is too long to wait!

there must have been a slight change/bugfix in there but it is hard to see

[16-Aug-18 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
easiest thing was to modify James' latest code with my changes again, instead of searching for a tiny change in that merge conflict

[16-Aug-18 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's really nice to run a test suite to see if you broke something

[16-Aug-18 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i got some interesting new failures from merging in your latest `jl777` branch

[16-Aug-18 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326

now they fail

[16-Aug-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
I need to understand, did behavior change? are my tests incorrect? or is there a genuine bug in the implementation

[16-Aug-18 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c also, faucetget took a very long time. I thought my tests were in an infinite loop, i can get you a more accurate number, but it's usually instant and now it seems much slower

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
james did some hardforking changes today

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not sure if you emplemented those

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
well this is all running on regtest

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
the above error seems new

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
and is why the tests fail

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ahh yes... you need a brand new address to get a faucetget

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
the address that receives from a faucet must have no utxos?

[16-Aug-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
is that what you are saying?

[16-Aug-18 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, the tests catching something like this is a good sign they are useful. When behavior changes, the tests notice

[16-Aug-18 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
also means that nobody else is running the tests and we don't have good indicators from travis CI

[16-Aug-18 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
we could have a little badge that shows pass/fail status, and even CC tests notify discord

[16-Aug-18 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
but these are new tests, so nobody else had access to them yet. Still, I would like to make test pass/failure easier to see/visualize

not quite sure how to modify my tests to support this, mostly because i just woke up

[16-Aug-18 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will send in a PR for review, even tho I still have this test failure

[16-Aug-18 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's turned into a lot of code and I would like some feedback
