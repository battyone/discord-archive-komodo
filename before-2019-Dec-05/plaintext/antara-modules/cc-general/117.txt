I've brodcasted withdrawal transaction

[17-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @SHossain I see that gatewaysspending suffer from same problem like oraclesinfo üòÉ 
BTW, when you both broadcasted withdraw on gateway was there enough to withdraw or you were testing what happens when you try to double withdraw? As validation on gateways is not done so it allows everything...

[17-Oct-18 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo We had different gateways

[17-Oct-18 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
And there was enough to withdraw yep

[17-Oct-18 09:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Problem seems a little bit different to oracle since I saw pending withdraw of @SHossain in pending withdraws of my GW and vice versa

[17-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
OK, got it.

[17-Oct-18 09:27 PM] TonyL#3577
But apparently tested what happens on double withdraw even if gateways are different üòÉ

[17-Oct-18 09:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
It's probably the problem of markers or baton as gatewaysspending is not making difference on two different gateways.

[19-Oct-18 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Only solution I've found so far for oracle type input validation is define in RPC list of allowed oracles like a:
```allowed_formats[] = {'s','S','d','D','c','C','t','T','i','I','l','L','h','Ihh'};```
And then match input with each element of this array, but it add additional complicity since in case if a new data type added to `oracles.cpp` this array have to be changed in `rpcwallet.cpp` as well or RPC will think it's not valid type.
I wonder maybe it's possible to store types in some global variable array in `oracles.cpp` and use this array in `rpcwallet.cpp` to implement data type input validation

[19-Oct-18 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
So if we add new type in `oracles.cpp` it's automatically valid for rpc

[19-Oct-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
what new types do you expect will be needed?

[19-Oct-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it handles binary data

[19-Oct-18 08:05 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Oct-18 09:44 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Oct-18 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Hehe C is really rocket science after Python, especially in spot of typization but almost won in this fight:

  "error": "oracles format not valid"
}
```

[19-Oct-18 10:21 AM] Mihailo#5902
Something is really weird happening with oracles. Sometimes it has funds and it works, sometimes not. When one stop working, other one on different node starts working....

[19-Oct-18 10:21 AM] Mihailo#5902
This is with oracles that have multiple publishers...

Look at third one. Fee is 30ksat but funds are 29999. So this happened few times, but I was in deep debug of gateways and I did not want to swithc focus.

[19-Oct-18 10:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it was txfee

[19-Oct-18 10:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh just 1 sat

[19-Oct-18 10:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
txfee of 1 sat üòâ Nevertheless, txfee is separate vout

[19-Oct-18 10:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
This happened when I registred oracle with 30k sat and sent one subscribe with 30k sat

[19-Oct-18 10:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
Don't know if it will happen if you send on first subscribe a lot more than fee

[19-Oct-18 10:29 AM] Mihailo#5902
My best suggestion to test this is to create oracle with 3 publishers and run 3 oraclefeeds for some time to see if it is going to happen. With starting and stopping oraclefeeds and nodes.

@gcharang `validateaddress` if this address belongs to your wallet

[19-Oct-18 03:20 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL validateaddress will get your the pubkey of your address, i guess @gcharang is looking for other way

Yup. as shossain says, I know pubkey  --> want to get address

Almost endless amount of addresses can be generated from one pubkey. Chances that you'll generated some "desirable" address --> 0 because of collision

@gcharang which language do you want to convert from pubkey -> address ?

@gcharang i think marketmaker can do it somehow, i forget. it prints out a pubkey somewhere that answers your question

there is no RPC that gives you the data

i wrote some C++ code recently that does this, it should probably be available via an RPC somehow

easiest thing is probably to patch komodo source code and print it out to stdout or whatever

[19-Oct-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
or use mm

[19-Oct-18 03:37 PM] gcharang#6833
can you tell me the version number for KMD in the conversion scheme?

[19-Oct-18 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang are you talking about prefixes/etc to create the address?

[19-Oct-18 03:38 PM] gcharang#6833
Yup like the thing that gives beginning 1 to bitcoin and beginning R to komodo

[19-Oct-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
```src/chainparams.cpp
169:        base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS] = std::vector<unsigned char>(1,60);
170:        base58Prefixes[SCRIPT_ADDRESS] = std::vector<unsigned char>(1,85);
171:        base58Prefixes[SECRET_KEY] =     std::vector<unsigned char>(1,188);```

Thank you. I will sort it out. Either in C or python. I have found some scripts for BTC. I might be able to edit them

i trust Decker's code, he is a notary node operator, and many NN's use that code for various chains

[19-Oct-18 03:40 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it.

[19-Oct-18 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's just like BTC

[19-Oct-18 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
instead of 0x00, it's 0x60, which gives an `R` instead of a `1` prefix

[19-Oct-18 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
mainnet/testnet/regtest can have different values, fyi

there are websites that generate BTC addr from pubkey and there are really only 1 address per compressed pubkey and 1 per non-compressed

[19-Oct-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure about this unlimited addresses from a single pubkey

[19-Oct-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is basically a totally wrong statement

[19-Oct-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
once you have a BTC address you can use the convaddress api in mm, or via dexstats.info

[19-Oct-18 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, I've messed things ‚ò∫

[19-Oct-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as you admit it, you are forgiven

thanks Jl that helped me out.

[19-Oct-18 06:39 PM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL I have made the doc out of the gateways guide: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/gateways/scenarios/tutorial.html
I haven't tested it completely but understood the flow of all of it. I will go through it and test it on CLI again tommorrow. It needs some minor edits to add more detail. 
@Mihailo once the parts related to M=/=N=/=1 are added to it, I will add those to the doc too.
