It is oraclessubscribe

[10-Dec-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
I just reverted some txfee and mempool changes to FSM. plz update and see if it still behaves this way

[10-Dec-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo let me know if the updated FSM fixes the propagation. if not, i fear we need to dig into just how exactly a transaction is propagated in the bitcoin code

[10-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I'm just testing, but it may also be another thing. I just see now that I wass adding nodes with rpc prot and not p2p port. But I had correct number of nodes in each node. It must be that I added the mining node with correct port to all and then they exchanged nodes..

[10-Dec-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
you should just addnode with ip address and not ports

[10-Dec-18 05:02 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, I had habbit of giving port number as my mining node is on idfferent port which I set with -port=

[10-Dec-18 05:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Now I broadcasted 3 oracle subscribe tx and all 3 reached mempool of mining node, but only one were mined and now mempool of mining node is empty. And 2 different nodes have other 2 txs

[10-Dec-18 05:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Now another tx of 2 left showed up in mining node and gets mined.

[10-Dec-18 05:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
And that one that is left dissapeared from all mempools

[10-Dec-18 05:12 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo is mempool became clear on other nodes as well?

[10-Dec-18 05:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
The one that is left is still in wallet of origin node, and I think it will try to rebroadcast it after a while

[10-Dec-18 05:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL yes, now it did. When there were 2 left, 2 nodes had them and 3 nodes had empty mempool

[10-Dec-18 05:14 PM] TonyL#3577
I've faced similar problems in my tests, usually mining switching to the node which initiating transactions helps

[10-Dec-18 05:15 PM] TonyL#3577
As I think it's related to the network connectivity mostly

[10-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, this was not behaving like this before...

[10-Dec-18 05:15 PM] TonyL#3577
If I left it for a very long time mempools syncing

[10-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
I had occasional problems, but not like this

[10-Dec-18 05:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you working on ms-gw atm?

[10-Dec-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
are you using the updated version?

[10-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
And I had problems when all my nodes were connected to mining node, but they did not have opened ports so they could not connect to each other. Now I have 4  of 5 nodes that can connect to each other.

[10-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Yes, I'm using latest commits

[10-Dec-18 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
For example I've used GCP nodes - they saw each other, were able to sync blocks

[10-Dec-18 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
but weren't able to sync mempool before I've made custom network rules

@Mihailo I will go ahead with MS GW testing on latest FSM also

[10-Dec-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
" they did not have opened ports" <- seems that was the problem?

[10-Dec-18 05:20 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I did sendrawtransaction of that one tx that did'nt mine and it reached only one node (not mining) for now.
And it starts printing:

[10-Dec-18 05:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thanks! @Alright

[10-Dec-18 05:20 PM] TonyL#3577
To see if I can repeat such behaviour

[10-Dec-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so things are working better? well enough or still a problem?

[10-Dec-18 05:20 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c No, that I wrote to TonyL that it was before. I have normal nodes few weeks now.

[10-Dec-18 05:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```channelsinfo 070c112d19cdd9846fbc887edc40484871d85eb6c9ac2c7aa1c59e7037be8a64

[10-Dec-18 05:21 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is not working better. It reaches only one node and stays like that.

[10-Dec-18 05:21 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Do you have all ports spectrum which komodod using opened?

[10-Dec-18 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
It's taking random ports between 60000-90000 for interconnecting

[10-Dec-18 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
do normal payments get relayed?

[10-Dec-18 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
As I've noticed

[10-Dec-18 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
is this just CC tx having propagation problems or all tx

[10-Dec-18 05:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
On 3 nodes I haveo n VPS I think all prots are opened. And on my mining node I have only p2p port opened.

[10-Dec-18 05:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think that is enough?

[10-Dec-18 05:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Good question, let me try normal tx

[10-Dec-18 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, you might try to open all ports on mining node also, or temporary change mining node

[10-Dec-18 05:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c It seems, all tx are having problem. Just made regular sendtoaddress tx and it did not reach any node...

[10-Dec-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain are we having problems broadcasting tx with latest version?

[10-Dec-18 05:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i didn't see issue. testing again

[10-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
Checked everything now. Deleted peers.dat from all nodes. Started daemons again. Every daemon has 4 connections, and there are 4 nodes started. Used sendtoaddress on node3 and it did not reach any node.

[10-Dec-18 05:36 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Now I rebroadcasted one tx that was stuck on node3 because the other one was dependant on it, and it seems to work now.

[10-Dec-18 05:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
Now I do not know, did the fix change anything or not...

[10-Dec-18 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007
i used `sendtoaddress` and it worked fine on KMD

[10-Dec-18 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007
compiled latest dev branch and used that

[10-Dec-18 05:41 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c ^^

[10-Dec-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems something about a small network

[10-Dec-18 05:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
It seems to work now.

[10-Dec-18 05:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
Should I try without revert?

[10-Dec-18 05:41 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Did you change something in mining node network rules?

[10-Dec-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, would be good to know if indeed that was the cause

[10-Dec-18 05:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL No

[10-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c It seems to be working ok without the fix too.

[10-Dec-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, then I say it is gremlins

[10-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
So this was probably some problem with my setup.

[10-Dec-18 05:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, on 2 nodes all three tx went through. But on 3rd node all three reached mining mempool, and when block was mined it was before mining node took them for minnig, so in for next block mining node took just one tx of 3, and other 2 dissapeared from mempool.

[10-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
That one is mined and those 2 are not mined still and only in wallet of 3rd node

[10-Dec-18 05:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
Correction, those 2 tx are on mempool of only one node (not the origin one). This is without the fix.

[10-Dec-18 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so the fix is good?

[10-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
Something phishy is going on, and I think that when oraclefeed starts feeding it will get to this point.

[10-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, not sure. As without the fix I was able to get this issue, but do not know if it does not happen with the fix. Not sure what is exact way to reproduce

[10-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I was able to reproduce it with the fix too.

[10-Dec-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, seems maybe you need to dig into the peering code

[10-Dec-18 06:14 PM] Mihailo#5902
If they do not get mined while they are in mining mempool for the block when they were transmitted, then they disappear from mempool

[10-Dec-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but the original node should rebroadcast it

[10-Dec-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
also if they are conflicting tx, it will indeeed get purged

[10-Dec-18 06:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, I do not know when it will rebroadcast it. but I saw for 10-15 blocks it wasn't retransmitted.

[10-Dec-18 06:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think I noteced this with oraclefeed few weeks ago. But then I was chasing that bug with addressIndex and then after I never get to this. Maybe some earlier change influenced this. I have to dig deeper.

[10-Dec-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
in main.cpp:     if ( ASSETCHAINS_CC != 0 ) // CC contracts might refer to transactions in the current block, from a CC spend within the same block and out of order
line 4678

[10-Dec-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it makes a copy of the mempool and makes sure they are all valid

[10-Dec-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
then at 4675:         // here we add back all txs from the temp mempool to the main mempool.

[10-Dec-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
they are added back in. you can check to see if that process is filtering out these missing tx

[10-Dec-18 06:18 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, I'll start from there first thing in the morning.

[12-Dec-18 12:20 PM] Mihailo#5902
It seems that it is a problem in that part of main.cpp.

I made this print to see what is removed from mempool into tempmempool and then added back and which one do not pass AcceptToMemoryPool - invalid.

[12-Dec-18 12:20 PM] Mihailo#5902
So the first two seems to fail to get back to the pool

[12-Dec-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the question is why it becomes invalid

[12-Dec-18 04:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
I localized it that it fails here:
```cpp
// do all inputs exist?
                // Note that this does not check for the presence of actual outputs (see the next check for that),
                // and only helps with filling in pfMissingInputs (to determine missing vs spent).
                BOOST_FOREACH(const CTxIn txin, tx.vin)
                {
                    if (!view.HaveCoins(txin.prevout.hash))
                    {
                        if (pfMissingInputs)
                            *pfMissingInputs = true;
                        //fprintf(stderr,"missing inputs\n");
                        //return state.DoS(0, error("AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found"),REJECT_INVALID, "bad-txns-inputs-missing");
                        return(false);
                    }
                }
```

[12-Dec-18 04:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
The thing that is strange is that it happens only on some txs and not all the time. So how come it cannot find inputs... I'm thinking that it is because I'm broadcasting 3 txs fast from TUI so the inputs used for 3rd could be the output from 2nd that does not exists yet, but I have not yet looked how this checks the outputs...

[12-Dec-18 04:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
I mean, this check is just checking if the tx refering an input exists, later it checks it the exact inputs exist (line 1740 - main.cpp)

[12-Dec-18 04:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ohhhh, it may be the order of adding the tx to mempool. In the beggining txs are removed from mempool (line 4678) and then they are pushed back to mempool (line 4765). Could be that at the moment the refering tx is not in the mempool so this cannot find it.

[12-Dec-18 04:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
`if ( ASSETCHAINS_CC != 0 ) // CC contracts might refer to transactions in the current block, from a CC spend within the same block and out of order` maybe this comment explain it 😛

[12-Dec-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, adding back seems to need similar logic as above

[12-Dec-18 04:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm just checking could this be in different order

[12-Dec-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it iterates adding the tx back and as long as 1 is added would continue

[12-Dec-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if none of them are accepted it would break out of the loop

[12-Dec-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is the issue

[12-Dec-18 04:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
