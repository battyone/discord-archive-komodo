[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
since it isnt really implemented yet

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
how many times do I have to repeat that it is not yet working

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
as I have not completed it yet

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not yet

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not working yet

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
heh 😅 sorry

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
nope, still not working

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
time passes

[02-Sep-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
still not working

[02-Sep-18 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
even more time passes

[02-Sep-18 06:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Guys, I just checked it and it's not working 🤔

[02-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
so anything worthwhile to test for it yet?

[02-Sep-18 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
most everything OTHER than oraclesdata could work

[02-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
👌

[02-Sep-18 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but oraclesdata will not work

[02-Sep-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
even if you got it to work, it wont be validated

[02-Sep-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
since validation is not yet done

[02-Sep-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
even after another 12 seconds....

[02-Sep-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
still not yet done

[02-Sep-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
I defined and implemented most of the oracles CC, but oraclesdata is not done yet

[02-Sep-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
next time I wont bother to announce until it is all done?

[02-Sep-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but i thought it would be useful for some to know the type of rpc that will be there, when it is all done

[02-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
yea will be useful, I'll get familiar with the vins/vouts of the other commands

[02-Sep-18 06:37 PM] TonyL#3577
IoT on UTXO 🤔 Looks like it's a very good time to finally buy Raspberry PI

[02-Sep-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
IoT on UTXO?

[02-Sep-18 06:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Just thinking about different types of oracles - physical devices which sending data to this CC

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, yes, most of the data services would just need to run some simple price polling software

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i plan to port most of the pax pricing into some standalone datafeeds

[02-Sep-18 06:40 PM] TonyL#3577
First idea was to connect it with Amazon IOT button for most basic demo making - it's using now for shopping, clicked button -> lambda function -> ordered good

[02-Sep-18 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
for that, maybe the triggers CC would be better

[02-Sep-18 06:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, but then I've recognised so better to start from let's say temperature sending from thermometer

[02-Sep-18 06:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a data which can affect on some financial agreement conditions

[02-Sep-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, oracle CC can do custom things, like some arbiter determining one outcome vs.another

[02-Sep-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it is to allow converting (any) offchain event into an onchain one

[02-Sep-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
you do need to trust the pubkeys to provide good data

[02-Sep-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
however, there will be correlation functionality that will treat a bundle of data providers for the same numerical values

[02-Sep-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is all evolving together, so now is the time for specific requests

[02-Sep-18 07:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Most interesting is how data from oracle CC can be used in other CCs.
Let's say I made a payment CC for some goods delivery. Receiver locked a payment in CC which connected to oracle, and oracle connected to GPS tracker. Let's say it's just one of contract conditions but to simplify I'll think that's the only. GPS tracker sent data that truck is on place (in simplification it means that goods are in it and we have a good arbitrary system). So now payment CC should unlock payment of buyer to goods deliver.
Have I use this payment CC as a subscriber on oracle CC to get some kind of boolean if condition met (received or not)?
Maybe it's good idea to add some logic for conditions creating to oracle CC

[02-Sep-18 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577
And maybe there should be some labels for data providers (e.g. names) and some data structures (like a data-sets). One data provider can provide different types of data, if there will be a data sets he'll not need to proof that he is trustable and that he is he each time when he want to provide different type of data (e.g. gps coordinates except of temperature).  Perhaps this will make the system easier to understand. Not sure about it, it's after midnight already and brains work not crystal.
But most interesting question for me is how to use data from oracle CC in other CCs for sure.

[02-Sep-18 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont want to conflate oracle with anything else, it will get complex enough to handle the mapping of all the possible offchain -> onchain

[02-Sep-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there will be other CC that will be able to specific oracltxid and some sort of evaluation of the data, with funds that could be released based on that, or maybe an asset transferred

[02-Sep-18 07:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Got it 👍

[02-Sep-18 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
like the assets CC, oracles CC is a level0 contract

[02-Sep-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
meaning it does what it does and other things will use its outputs

[02-Sep-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i have triggers CC and payments CC and FSM CC the ones that are higher level to use the other CC contract values

[02-Sep-18 07:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks like only this CC opening possibilities for more than 256 new ones. Books, documents, contracts, science researches data, .... -> everything will be possible to move on chain. Even Cardi B songs lyrics can became immutable and trustable if needed.

[02-Sep-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but one oracles CC can create unlimited number of data subscriptions

[02-Sep-18 07:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, I meant new ways of data usage by these 256 - like a much much more possibilities to the whole system

[02-Sep-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is why I am deferring on app specific CC for now

[02-Sep-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
also, the 256 limit is not set in stone, it is easily expandable to 65536 or 2^64

[02-Sep-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but I think with just 32, we can get a lot of possible dapps via rpc only

[02-Sep-18 07:29 PM] TonyL#3577
are you considering voting/arbitrary contracts as a cores?

[02-Sep-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
some basic voting will be part of prices, maybe even triggers CC

[02-Sep-18 07:37 PM] TonyL#3577
great, now my now my subconscious will work on new types of oracles application while sleeping 😃 . thanks for sharing @jl777c !

[03-Sep-18 02:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

When atomic swaps with Cc?

{Reactions}
😃 (2) shexy (2) 

[03-Sep-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that doesnt make sense. atomic swaps are independent from CC

[03-Sep-18 02:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So. Will it he possible to pull barterdex price feeds using oracle?

[03-Sep-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
oracle can be any data

[03-Sep-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles in FSM is now feature complete, but not tested yet:
 An oracles CC has the purpose of converting offchain data into onchain data
 simplest would just be to have a pubkey(s) that are trusted to provide such data, but this wont need to have a CC involved at all and can just be done by convention
 
 That begs the question, "what would an oracles CC do?"
 A couple of things come to mind, ie. payments to oracles for future offchain data and maybe some sort of dispute/censoring ability
 
 first step is to define the data that the oracle is providing. A simple name:description tx can be created to define the name and description of the oracle data.
 linked to this txid would be two types of transactions:
    a) oracle providers
    b) oracle data users
 
 In order to be resistant to sybil attacks, the feedback mechanism needs to have a cost. combining with the idea of payments for data, the oracle providers will be ranked by actual payments made to each oracle for each data type.

[03-Sep-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
Implementation notes:
  In order to maintain good performance even under heavy usage, special market utxo are used. Actually a pair of them. When a provider registers to be a data provider, a special unspendable normal output is created to allow for quick scanning. Since the marker is based on the oracletxid, it becomes a single address where all the providers can be found. 
 
  A convention is used so that the datafee can be changed by registering again. it is assumed that there wont be too many of these datafee changes. if more than one from the same provider happens in the same block, the lower price is used.
 
  The other efficiency issue is finding the most recent data point. We want to create a linked list of all data points, going back to the first one. In order to make this efficient, a special and unique per provider/oracletxid baton utxo is used. This should have exactly one utxo, so the search would be a direct lookup and it is passed on from one data point to the next. There is some small chance that the baton utxo is spent in a non-data transaction, so provision is made to allow for recreating a baton utxo in case it isnt found. The baton utxo is a convenience and doesnt affect validation
 
 Required transactions:
 0) create oracle description -> just needs to create txid for oracle data
 1) register as oracle data provider with price -> become a registered oracle data provider
 2) pay provider for N oracle data points -> lock funds for oracle provider
 3) publish oracle data point -> publish data and collect payment

[03-Sep-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
The format string is a set of chars with the following meaning:
  's' -> <256 char string
  'S' -> <65536 char string
  'c' -> 1 byte signed little endian number, 'C' unsigned
  't' -> 2 byte signed little endian number, 'T' unsigned
  'i' -> 4 byte signed little endian number, 'I' unsigned
  'l' -> 8 byte signed little endian number, 'L' unsigned
  uppercase is unsigned, lowercase is a signed number
 
 create:
 vins.*: normal inputs
 vout.0: txfee tag to oracle normal address
 vout.1: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with name and description and format for data
 
 register:
 vins.*: normal inputs
 vout.0: txfee tag to normal marker address
 vout.1: baton CC utxo
 vout.2: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with createtxid, pubkey and price per data point
 
 subscribe:
 vins.*: normal inputs
 vout.0: subscription fee to publishers CC address
 vout.1: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with createtxid, registered provider's pubkey, amount
 
 data:
 vin.0: normal input
 vin.1: baton CC utxo (most of the time)
 vin.1+: subscription vout.0
 vout.0: change to publishers CC address
 vout.1: baton CC utxo
 vout.2: payment for dataprovider
 vout.3: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with prevbatontxid and data in proper format
 
 data (without payment)
 vin.0: normal input
 vin.1: baton CC utxo
 vout.0: txfee to publishers normal address
 vout.1: baton CC utxo
 vout.2: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with prevbatontxid and data in proper format

[03-Sep-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
Oracles creates a market for blockchain external data

[03-Sep-18 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the data can be anything at all

[03-Sep-18 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it does require prepaying for data to the provider

[03-Sep-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but as long as the initial payments are small, then the risk is limited and over time, the reliable publishers will become known

[03-Sep-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
there is nothing that uses the Oracles CC (yet), that is next on my list

Sometimes for a just "simple C coder" you feel so much more....... Just wondering where all that talent comes from. All respect to you! @jl777c

[03-Sep-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
I just try to make the simplest solution for the task at hand, but in this case a bit more complexity and it creates the possibilty of data markets. so it seemed worth supporting that

[03-Sep-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and making simple solutions to complex problems is the most difficult

[03-Sep-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c Is there / or will be there any way to check if I'm subscribed for oracles plan after `oraclessubscribe`  or check a list of my subscribtions?

[04-Sep-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
well it works such that everyone sees the data, even if you didnt pay

[04-Sep-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
there is oraclessamples that is supposed to display the formatted data

[04-Sep-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
only if the data provider is sending encrypted data is there a point to point delivery

[04-Sep-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
I forgot to add an binary data type, will add that. if you can think of any other data types that format should support, let me know

[04-Sep-18 11:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so payments and oracle are testable ? or not yet?

[04-Sep-18 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
oracle is testable, but I havent yet done a "make sure it at least works in one case" so likely it wont work

[04-Sep-18 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
above is an example of creating an oracle txid, then registering, subscribing (you can subscribe to your own), posting data and then extracting it via oraclessamples

[04-Sep-18 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the oraclesdata is passed a hexstring that needs to match the format, there isnt much error checking now, so dont make mistakes when issuing the rpc calls

[04-Sep-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
other than lack of error checking, it should work with high performance, regardless of the number of active oracles, or the number of data publishers publishing data. of course there could be some bugs in the massively active scenarios, but I am using special utxo to instantly find the datatip (most recent data published) for any of the potentially thousands of oracle sources.

[04-Sep-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
That is why it took so long to code this, getting a high performance solution.

[04-Sep-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so after the basics are working, it would be good to verify that it indeed can handle hundreds, or thousands of data publishers. there is an inherent limit of one oraclesdata per block per publisher/oracletxid

[04-Sep-18 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577
👌  scripting time

[04-Sep-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have an incrementing number as the data source, we can see any bugs with the oraclessamples by scanning the data for gaps

[04-Sep-18 08:30 PM] TonyL#3577
So scheme should looks like this:
Input file A with X records -> Publish to blockchain -> Output file B grabbed from blockchain (should be equivalent to file A)
