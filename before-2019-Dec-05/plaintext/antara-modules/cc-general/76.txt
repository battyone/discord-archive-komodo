I pushed a new version that has -ac_ccactivate=height implemented

[22-Aug-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that an existing chain can update to activate the CC contracts

[22-Aug-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
however all instances need to run the same -ac_ccactivate=height value or nodes will fork. also, the first time it will reindex

[22-Aug-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
siu and i verified it worked in at least one case, but if you do CC tx before the activate height, it seems strange things can happen

Maybe we have to try activate it for BRK?

[22-Aug-18 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
BRK already using CC

[22-Aug-18 07:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh right)))

[22-Aug-18 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
has to be existing chain. list of current chains can be found in `assetchains.old` file

[22-Aug-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
what we did was to make a test chain, start it without CC, then update all nodes using a specific activate height

[22-Aug-18 07:29 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodod -ac_name=COQUITEST2 -ac_supply=72000000 -ac_ccactivate=140 -addnode=24.54.206.138 &`

[22-Aug-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
on a chain that didnt do any CC before the activation height, it worked fine

[22-Aug-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
also syncing after it is past activate height also worked

[22-Aug-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but having a chain with 2 or 3 nodes is one thing

[22-Aug-18 07:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@SHossain  that chain already passed the activatde height

[22-Aug-18 07:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe would be good to try another example

[22-Aug-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
one that is notarized and having many user nodes, all needing to be updated with same -ac_ccactivate height...

[22-Aug-18 07:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
coqui? :trollface:

[22-Aug-18 07:32 PM] xRobeSx#5136
If you have an existing non cc assetchain and want to add it, do you add `ac_ccactivate=x` and `ac_cc=2` ? and then after the activation block can you just use `ac_cc=2` since its already a cc chain?

[22-Aug-18 07:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it will only need -ac_ccactivate=blockcheight

[22-Aug-18 07:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
forever

[22-Aug-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it defaults to using -ac_cc=2

[22-Aug-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant add -ac_cc=2 on the command line and still connect to the same chain, so itis a bit tricky

[22-Aug-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why I made the -ac_ccactivate option to take care of this trickiness

[22-Aug-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
also addressindex=1 and spentindex=1 is needed, but it does that automatic

**How to Activate CC (-ac_cc) on Existing Chain?**

If you have an existing assetchain on Komodo platform without CryptoConditions enabled, you can activate it any time. Komodo supports `-ac_ccactivate=height` call, using which you can activate CC on a non-CC enabled chain in a future block height.

## Example

The first existing chain which doesn't have CC enabled, the startup command looks like this
```
./komodod -ac_name=COQUITEST2 -ac_supply=72000000 -addnode=24.54.206.138 &
```
It was a very easy way to start a chain using Komodo technology, with very few parameters. In order to activate CC in this chain, all we have to do is the following:
```
./komodod -ac_name=COQUITEST2 -ac_supply=72000000 -ac_ccactivate=140 -addnode=24.54.206.138 &
```
`-ac_ccactivate=140` means, the CC activation will happen in block 140. You can set that to any block height you want the CC to be activated.

In order for this to happen, all nodes must update. If the chain was being notarized, Notary Nodes need to update as well with the same param for everyone.

Once CC is confirmed working, do not change the startup script. If you do, that will create a new fork.

By default, `-ac_ccactivate=height` uses `-ac_cc=2`. But, you cant add `-ac_cc=2` on the command line, as this will create a new fork. `-ac_ccactivate=height` will take care of those things automagically.

Also `addressindex=1` and `spentindex=1` is needed, but it does that automatic with `-ac_ccactivate=height`.

we do need to test to make sure it works reliably. so far it has been limited testing

[22-Aug-18 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
i can create a new chain now and let it run with normal parameteres tonight. once more testers joins and has the availablility tomorrow, or day after tomorrow we can try activating together.

[22-Aug-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and do things wrong to make sure even users that dont follow instructions can have a path to the new mainchain

i want to have a release candidate made based on bugs found by tomorrow, I fix them Friday and it can update up to master branch over the weekend

[22-Aug-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
then one final test and push out to the field

[22-Aug-18 08:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
let me know the parameters ill leave a node running

[22-Aug-18 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
tomorrow i can be all day testing

[22-Aug-18 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so far, on my test of the cc i have not found any other bug recently

[22-Aug-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem to have become pretty hard to find bugs with CC

[22-Aug-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
surprised assets are working so solid

[22-Aug-18 08:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would be nice to do a stress test of some kind

[22-Aug-18 08:25 PM] SHossain#0007
with asset/token buy or sell, i didn't find issues while doing  manual trades. very fast experince.

[22-Aug-18 08:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yep

[22-Aug-18 08:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL is creating some auto testing script for Token trading.

[22-Aug-18 08:26 PM] SHossain#0007
those tests i assume will be helpful with further info

[22-Aug-18 08:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, this stuff, dropped yesterday here: 
https://github.com/tonymorony/kmd_cc_qa I've started to write some auto-tests for Token CC
For this CC testing I'm planning two modes: 1) Tests itself 2) Kinda CLI exchange based on Token CC -  in case if someone will want to have fun manually 
For now made auto-test for token adding process and in CLI possible to add tokens and list all available tokens.
Trading features of this CC I want to cover until the weekend.

Want to make something similar for dice contract and others to make 2 in 1: tests and some interactive demonstration of possibilities

[22-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c my point earlier is that if you can't prevent `dicelist` from being spammed, could you add some way to sort through it? Maybe by the pubkey of creator?

[22-Aug-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the DB is not indexed by sender

[22-Aug-18 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
Sorry, what?

[22-Aug-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
Can you imagine what `dicelist` will look like on KMD after a year though?

[22-Aug-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
dicelist as in a zillion dice plans?

[22-Aug-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[22-Aug-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
why would people be doing this?

[22-Aug-18 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
lulz? It costs 1 coin for ~1000 dice plans

[22-Aug-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
It's something I can seriously see myself doing üòÇ

[22-Aug-18 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
not much can be done about evil spammers

[22-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
I just think `dicelist` will be virtually unusable after some time.

[22-Aug-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
I imagine if that were to happen, services could use KV for their funding txids

[22-Aug-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
or people will just say, use this diceplan and people use it direct without using dicelist

[22-Aug-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
or a more efficient rpc call can be made. it isnt a consensus issue so can always have some custom solution if it becomes a problem that needs to be solved

[22-Aug-18 09:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Am I understand correct that `"funcid"` in `tokenorders` declaring is it bid or ask?

[22-Aug-18 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
```  {
    "funcid": "S",
    "txid": "96d7be2297c8e0f1a299a05e30164c1d566d9d1d5a52b8edebede1981f625023",

In this output

[22-Aug-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
s/S is sell (ask)

[22-Aug-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810

Part of the test is to activate cc and be sure they work afterwards

[22-Aug-18 09:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Most important changes will be when already existing chains hard fork

[22-Aug-18 11:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I think I just found strange behaviour in token CC:

1)  Created ask offer ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK tokenask 1000 2d36de839217cc8245d8a4db0723859f53ef93fdd0735c9fe47af3c7edaeb6e9 1```
```  {
    "funcid": "s",
    "txid": "56265459d4390305b94688f88d0d3789b18568bce237338ffbe64fb798f6e9d0",
    "vout": 0,
    "amount": "1000",
    "askamount": "1000",
    "origaddress": "RTLfdpVPhgGygeExTJhvsdbBf6rwvHs5FY",
    "tokenid": "2d36de839217cc8245d8a4db0723859f53ef93fdd0735c9fe47af3c7edaeb6e9",
    "totalrequired": "1000.00000000",
    "price": "1.00000000"
  }
```
2) Send transaction on sum > then ask amount 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK tokenfillask 2d36de839217cc8245d8a4db0723859f53ef93fdd0735c9fe47af3c7edaeb6e9 56265459d4390305b94688f88d0d3789b18568bce237338ffbe64fb798f6e9d0 1999```
`"result": "success"`

After transaction confirmation ask order disappeared from `tokenorders`
My tokens balance remained the same. Coin balance reduced on transactions fee.

[22-Aug-18 11:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, false alarm. I guess I just sold my tokens to myself actually lol. Dunno what I've expected.

Yes, everything work correct and I've received my change when tried to fill someones ask with sum more than ask amount

[22-Aug-18 11:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Don't think it's issue but: 
When I fulfil ask/bid (it's not in`tokenorders` anymore) I can call again fillask/fillbid for same order txid and get `"result": "success"` + hex + `fillbuy validated`. 
On raw transaction sending stage I'm getting ```error code: -26
error message:
18: bad-txns-inputs-spent```
+ `totally filled!`

Expected result for me was kinda `totally filled` when I call for fillask\fillbid

Also have same scenario when trying to cancel order not belonging to me.

Could you tell me the best way to update when using ```After compiling komodo using jl777 branch, use:

cd ~
mkdir jl777

cp ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli ~/jl777/komodo-cli

[23-Aug-18 11:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks @siu - Chainmakers @SHossain I wasn't able to git anything inside ~/jl777.  I'll do it outside and re-cp `komodod` and `komodo-cli` back in.

[23-Aug-18 11:19 AM] SHossain#0007
you can't git anything inside that directory. you have to compile in the directory where you originally compiled them in the first place

[23-Aug-18 11:19 AM] SHossain#0007
jl777 directory is an example that you created manually, not by git clone command. so, git won't work there

can you make a bet on those dice plans?

maybe you shouldnt be able to make a diceplan without sending some funds... te it wouldnt be so easy to make 20,000 of them

[23-Aug-18 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also found problems with dice, that makes it give me a heaps of  "free" coins if I resync my node. I assume my node just didnt see them as it bugged out...

[23-Aug-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and resync made them "reappear" in my wallet

[23-Aug-18 11:25 AM] SHossain#0007
You need funds to create a dice plan. Currently, it allows 0.0001 to create a dice plan

[23-Aug-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its mostly Alrights fault for putting 1000 entropy TX into the DICE fund on STAKED2 when he was tired, and it allowed me to just kep playing fo r8H straight

[23-Aug-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it timed out the creator node and all the bets timed out and claimed to me.

[23-Aug-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... yes, there are a lot of people who would do such thiings

[23-Aug-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
