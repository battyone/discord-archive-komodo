i would like to see your full exact CLI

[06-Aug-18 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
because if you are testing multiple times, with the same -ac_name=FOO, the directory already exists, and weird shit might happen

[06-Aug-18 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
change your AC name constantly, or keep deleting the directory  it creates

[06-Aug-18 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
is one idea

[06-Aug-18 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, compare the komodo.conf from CC and non-CC nodes, just in case there is something different

[06-Aug-18 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
in the test suite, i just fixed a bug where it would not create komodo.confs correctly because it's inherited from zcash which does not require txindex=1

that python code is the test suite infrastructure, that automates starting/stopping/managing regtest komodod's

[06-Aug-18 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can't even get CC to think i started with -pubkey

[06-Aug-18 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
i do a `git init` in my .komodo directories, and it lets you see config files changes/being added/deleted/etc, just an idea for you, if you occasionally commit and make checkpoints

[06-Aug-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
i usually use git to keep track of all my wallet.dat's and relevant .conf's

[06-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Mylo#8306
ok, will check, here's cli first.  git cloned to /   fs root hence command not in homedir

ok cool, i'll keep an eye on qa dir in future.  might be my turn to learn python 2nd half of 2018!  incidently, explained where the term "bug" comes from to my girlfriend yesterday - she thought it was anecdotally awesome there's a story to it (yoga teacher, totally non-tech)

here's CLI
no -ac_name, so plain old KMD
```
 /komodo/src/komodod  -ac_cc=1 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=100000000  -pubkey=033ace50aedf8df70035b962a805431363a61cc4e69d99d90726a2d48fb195f68c -regtest &
```
then
```
/komodo/src/komodo-cli -regtest generate 120
```
resulting in
```
(tx.0: 3.00000000  KOMODO_LASTMINED.118 -> 119
) KMD ht.119
(tx.0: 3.00000000  KOMODO_LASTMINED.119 -> 120

[06-Aug-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
very useful

[06-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Mylo#8306
hmmmm... i might pass -conf in then.

[06-Aug-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
my idea is to use the txids you know, like 9ac0f5c558f46f763a10cc9be08f7054a6e86cb8758cb9b21d877161043b627e, and use RPCs to see what is up

[06-Aug-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
like `getrawtransaction 9ac0f5c558f46f763a10cc9be08f7054a6e86cb8758cb9b21d877161043b627e 1` or whatever it is

[06-Aug-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
see if something is wrong with the xtn or something

[06-Aug-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo plz show the output of `listtransactions "*" 1000`

[06-Aug-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
in a gist or whatev if it's big 😃

[06-Aug-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
or you can sleep, that is always an option

[06-Aug-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
you seem to be mining correctly, and your logs have txids

[06-Aug-18 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
they don't even show up as immature

[06-Aug-18 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is weird

[06-Aug-18 03:24 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah i'll compare just -regtest because i noticed "longestchain: 0" in the getinfo, and i'll also pass conf file on command line

[06-Aug-18 03:24 PM] Mylo#8306
be about 10 mins

@Mylo try `getrawtransaction`

[06-Aug-18 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also make sure that your regtest komodo.conf has txindex=1

[06-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Mylo#8306

[06-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Mylo#8306
i had to import my privkey for notary to get coins

[06-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Mylo#8306
getblock->getrawtransaction->decoderawtransaction it had my NN address.
importprivkey and 100,000,027 + 300 immature from mining reward on 110 blocks.

that's cool, regtest faucetfund, does fund it.

[06-Aug-18 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo oh, you used a NN pubkey instead of a locally generated one from `getnewaddress`, that is why 😃

[06-Aug-18 04:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo if you keep a record of your manual tests somehow, in a gist or something, that will be useful for me writing python tests

[06-Aug-18 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326

[06-Aug-18 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
what am I missing?

[06-Aug-18 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
do we have a list of new CC RPCs somewhere? Or do I need to regex some .cpp files?

[06-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Mylo#8306
that's the thing, i thought it had to be NN pubkey.  nah i'll get you link

[06-Aug-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe I am confusing myself. With verus, you can mine to an address with -pubkey

[06-Aug-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe with KMD -pubkey is only for valid notaries?

[06-Aug-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
if so, they we need to have a "fake regtest notary"

[06-Aug-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
because we can't put a real KMD notary privkey in the test suite or dApp builder stuff

[06-Aug-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
`to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet` doesn't say it must be a NN pubkey

[06-Aug-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe it does need to be

[06-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Mylo#8306
good reading. i thought it was because CC need to have NN pubkey because of the cross-chain-ness?

[06-Aug-18 05:28 PM] SHossain#0007
komodod and any AC can start with `-pubkey` option and mine and do other stuff

[06-Aug-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, that is what I figured

[06-Aug-18 05:29 PM] SHossain#0007
works with VRSC as it is using komodod

[06-Aug-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can't figure out why CC's RPCs think that I have not enabled pubkey

[06-Aug-18 05:29 PM] SHossain#0007
we are using this `./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=AT1 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -pubkey=<your_pubkey> -addnode=195.201.137.5 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=78.47.205.239 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &`

[06-Aug-18 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is good to know, that is kind of our "official" test chain. I am trying to make it so that we have a test suite that "spins up" a chain like that and runs tests on it

[06-Aug-18 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am going to try to translate some of the manual tests you do to AT1 into automatic tests, and they can run in Travis on every commit, or on PRs/merges/etc

[06-Aug-18 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326

cool. thanks @siu - Chainmakers

[06-Aug-18 05:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
in theory, the test suite can test cross-chain stuff too

[06-Aug-18 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm adding a column for each plan to list the example outputs

[06-Aug-18 05:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
first, i will try to get it to spin up nodes of 1 kind of AC (right now it can only do KMD), and then next will be able to spin up AC's with different parameters in the test, so you can test cross-chain stuff

[06-Aug-18 05:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
all your manual testing helps me understand what kinds of tests are going to be most valuable to run all the time. Like James said, some tests are more valuable, in terms of ROI, than others

[06-Aug-18 05:38 PM] SHossain#0007
cross-chain stuff not ready yet, as i remember. jl777 wanted to make single chain stuff stable first. but, it is good to have it ready.

[06-Aug-18 05:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
sure, i am just saying that it will be possible. Testing all the RPCs on a single chain gives us the most ROI at first

[06-Aug-18 05:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
then we can try to test for bugs that happen in cross-chain scenarios after that

pubkey option works all the time, it just sets a change pubkey

i am going to try this on Linux to see if this is an osx bug

[06-Aug-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it is a notary pubkey, it enables notary mode

[06-Aug-18 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326

komodod to start the chain has -ac_name=REGTEST but every komodo-cli call does not use -ac_name, and faucetinfo returns success.

[06-Aug-18 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmm

[06-Aug-18 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
not so sure about that

[06-Aug-18 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
without -ac_name=REGTEST, you are running against your normal KMD i would think

[06-Aug-18 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
without it I get ```$ ./komodo-cli -regtest faucetinfo

[06-Aug-18 06:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
because I never made a normal KMD regtest on this machine

[06-Aug-18 06:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
