Bet 5
`getbalance` down 10
5 later returned.

[28-Aug-18 12:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Is that always the case?

[28-Aug-18 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
(STAKED3)

[28-Aug-18 12:21 PM] SHossain#0007
that can mean, you had 1 utxo of 10. When you sent 5 out of the wallet, that used the utxo and showed 10 gone, until the next block where it was confirmed. so, you could see 5 came back.

[28-Aug-18 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Great, thanks!

[28-Aug-18 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL you need to send a hash of arguments to `getspentinfo` and it looks like you are sending an array of arguments

[28-Aug-18 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
`rpc.getspentinfo( { ... } )` instead of `rpc.getspentinfo( ... )`

[28-Aug-18 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are sending a hash on the CLI, with key/value pairs, but looks like trying to use an array of values via your paste above

[28-Aug-18 03:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why im getting ```{
    "result": {
        "result": "error",
        "error": "Diceinit error in status"
    },
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}```

[28-Aug-18 03:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in dic status?

[28-Aug-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
because DiceInit() function failed

[28-Aug-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it's a bug the way it returns that JSON

[28-Aug-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i've noticed it but not fixed it yet

[28-Aug-18 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers exactly how do you trigger that issue?

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe @TonyL can write a test 😃

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
do dicebet

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sendrawtransaction

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
it is a sign of an actual problem

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and when i check dicestatus that is the response

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
previoiusly, you would get a null json response or some crazy c++ error

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
now it tells you vaguely why

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
so something is not quite right

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[28-Aug-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im rebuilding and will try again

[28-Aug-18 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you can create a gist of the exact full commands + responses to generate that error, that helps James to debug and me + Tony to write automated tests

[28-Aug-18 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
and specify which chain you are running it against, because we have a lot of chains going around

[28-Aug-18 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
DICE is playing up on STAKED3 aswell.

[28-Aug-18 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Found a few issues aleady.

[28-Aug-18 04:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
99% of the issue seems to be back logged mempool

[28-Aug-18 04:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[28-Aug-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
``` ./pos-cli getrawmempool | jq length
132
```

[28-Aug-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[28-Aug-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blocks are not even full 😕

[28-Aug-18 04:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
some cc rpc's must have confirmed xtns to work, if a funding xtn is in the mempool still for whatever reason, things will fail

[28-Aug-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
only rewards spending is able to spend from mempool

[28-Aug-18 06:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ohh... it was a typo i had.

[28-Aug-18 06:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
dicestatus is working as expected

[28-Aug-18 10:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how long can the description of a token can be?

[28-Aug-18 11:10 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto `getspentinfo` not parsing hash of arguments at the moment

[29-Aug-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not funding txs, its dice bet txs... Trying to send 10 per block and my mempool was just piling up to over 100 transactions, only on the node dice bet is called BTW, my other nodes don't have such a huge mempool. Will look further into this today it was super late so just left it spamming while I slept.

[29-Aug-18 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r are the ones not being accepted to the other nodes being spent from the mempool?

[29-Aug-18 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to check this properly, all I know is that the mempool was longer on one node thatn on my others. Then I went to sleep

[29-Aug-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have wuite a few thigns to get through today, but will do this first.

[29-Aug-18 01:10 AM] Alright#0419
Have a feeling that's what is happening

[29-Aug-18 01:10 AM] Alright#0419
had the same experience on POSTEST a couple weeks ago when I was trying to fill blocks

[29-Aug-18 01:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL show me a failing test for `getspentinfo`, of how you expect it to work

[29-Aug-18 01:54 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto 
I've tried:
rpc.getspentinfo(betid, 0)
rpc.getspentinfo(betid,"0")

```
DEBUG:BitcoinRPC:-96-> getspentinfo ["e0a6afd8cc5b28579a84ef3f07af875f75c59f06671294f93d5bea6230ef6c61", "0"]

```

[29-Aug-18 01:55 AM] TonyL#3577
In cli such command not work as well because of JSON parcing: `komodo-cli getspentinfo e0a6afd8cc5b28579a84ef3f07af875f75c59f06671294f93d5bea6230ef6c61 0`

[29-Aug-18 01:56 AM] TonyL#3577
So just to get this printout when troubleshooted I used it like a:
```
    json = {'txid' : "", 'index' : 0}
    json['txid'] = betid
    spentinfo = rpc.getspentinfo(json)
```

[29-Aug-18 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c can `tokenlist` api reflect name of the token too?

[29-Aug-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm going to show tokenlist output on default page in the GUI

[29-Aug-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think of displaying the name just like we see our usernames here on discord

[29-Aug-18 09:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like:
name: TESTTOKEN
tokenid: 012d1e11dd98e5963c49895640d6cc6ed5d24a30cbe07fa4aeaf45618cbaa9c9

will display it like:
TESTTOKEN:a9c9

[29-Aug-18 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with different color

[29-Aug-18 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just a quick thought on how to differentiate a duplicate named token

[29-Aug-18 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
we had such issues on NXT

[29-Aug-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
tokenlist would need to do an extra call for each, the idea is that the GUI will issue a tokeninfo call for new tokenids it sees

[29-Aug-18 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@grewalsatinder I've initialised such list of tokens with names this way:
```
    tokens_ids = json.loads(check_output(
    ["komodo-cli","-ac_name="+ac_name,"tokenlist"]))
    tokens_list = {}

    for token_id in tokens_ids:
        tokens_info = json.loads(check_output(
        ["komodo-cli","-ac_name="+ac_name,"tokeninfo",token_id]))
        tokens_list[tokens_info["name"]] = tokens_info["tokenid"]
    return tokens_list
```
Worked pretty fast. I guess it's possible to implement something similar to sync only server each X seconds and clients will get output from this static list

[29-Aug-18 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... in that case it'll be multiple API calls case to single refresh button or refresh call.

[29-Aug-18 09:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if 1000 tokens then 1000 API calls

[29-Aug-18 09:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
1 tokenlist call + 1000 tokeninfo calls

[29-Aug-18 09:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
1001

[29-Aug-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
why?

[29-Aug-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant remember which tokenid you already have?

[29-Aug-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and then it would just be a call for any new ones

[29-Aug-18 09:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz I'm displaying the list of tokens with names or other info in table view on default load.

[29-Aug-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant remember which tokenid you already have? along with its info
and then it would just be a call for any new ones

[29-Aug-18 09:35 AM] TonyL#3577
You can keep the list of existing tokens and call token info only for new ones which appeared in tokenlist I guess

[29-Aug-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
this is what I keep saying

[29-Aug-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
is that a problem to do for the GUI?

[29-Aug-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to burden the api to do extra calls for every tokenlist call made?

[29-Aug-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Aug-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c it not the matter of I can remember or not.
it's how a user know which token the user wants to go with

[29-Aug-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
cant you create a map of txid to display data

[29-Aug-18 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm thinking of user's ui flow

[29-Aug-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
then given a txid, you look up the tokeninfo data from cache, if not there, then issue call and add to cache

[29-Aug-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but tokeninfo call is very fast anyway

[29-Aug-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how this impacts ui flow in any way at all

[29-Aug-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
making the tokenlist rpc call issue N txid lookups for every time it is called, forever, to make it more convenient for gui is not a good tradeoff

[29-Aug-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
this is something the GUI side needs to deal with

[29-Aug-18 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577
What if GUI app server side call tokenlist -> tokeinfo for new tokens each few minutes, save this data, and user on refresh just getting this saved data without any additional calls to API

[29-Aug-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
store the tokeninfo associated with the tokenid

[29-Aug-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and just use the stored data

[29-Aug-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if the user refreshes, then it takes 2 seconds and does all the rpc calls again

[29-Aug-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the problem?

[29-Aug-18 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, will do it that way then.
will think of using the custom UI side cache

[29-Aug-18 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
on refresh user won't get any api calls triggered. API calls will triggered on blocknotify call in backend.

[29-Aug-18 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for both of your replies 👍

[29-Aug-18 09:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, guess there might be a problem in case of millions tokens existing, maybe will be good to separate stored data by alphabet letters or something like that for faster backends calls.
Like a if token name start from A he go straight to search in a smaller file which contains only A tokens

[29-Aug-18 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sorting can be taken care by JS, that shouldn't be issue.

[29-Aug-18 09:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but on startup loading time the app will call all the tokenlist and tokeninfo calls. no matter if 4 or 1000 or mil. will save those in UI's cache system

[29-Aug-18 09:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will use blocknotify feature to trigger update to the API call to only get update of new tokenid and add it to existing

[29-Aug-18 09:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
either I have to keep this info also saved on local storage for next quick start or may be the next restart will also fetch the same data again to get updates

[29-Aug-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
reprocessing every block seems like overkill

[29-Aug-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe just once per hour is enough, so 59 of 60 blocknotifies can be skipped

[29-Aug-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as there is a button for the user to trigger a new processing that should keep the load to a minimum

[29-Aug-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, can do. 🙂 👍

[29-Aug-18 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@grewalsatinder if you need some testing , let me know

[29-Aug-18 12:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will do mate.... 🙂

[29-Aug-18 12:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
consider my work a student level work this time. It's not gonna be end user anyway. all a testers area... so will let you guys know soon
