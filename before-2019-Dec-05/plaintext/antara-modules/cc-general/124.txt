Hello ! What is required to join the CC training? C++?

[02-Nov-18 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
C/C++ is needed at this stage for making/customizing CC

[02-Nov-18 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
using the CC via rpc can be done with any language that can issue cli/rpc calls

[02-Nov-18 03:41 PM] OsTa#2589
So that mean I can have some interaction on a CC with python but I can't write a contract right?

[02-Nov-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
with python, you can use all the CC rpc calls, but not create new CC rpc calls

[02-Nov-18 03:42 PM] OsTa#2589
through the rpc calls

[02-Nov-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Nov-18 03:42 PM] OsTa#2589
ok clear

[02-Nov-18 03:42 PM] OsTa#2589
thanks

[02-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
@OsTa you can create a full dapps using oracles contract and python

[02-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
you can code the "consensus" rules into the dapp itself if they are not vital

[02-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
for example, the chat dapp has a special format for oracle names that will let it know it's a chat room

[02-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
and all versions of the dapp will agree on that format

[02-Nov-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
you can have a dapp that watches an oracle for updates and does anything you can write in python(or whatever language) based on what's pushed to the oracle

Trollbox GUI seems ugly but testable.

[03-Nov-18 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
To start testing:
1) git clone https://github.com/tonymorony/trollbox_gui
2) sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip libssl-dev
     pip3 install requests
     pip3 install wheel
     pip3 install kivy 
     pip3 install python-bitcoinlib
     pip3 install python-bitcoinrpc
3) Hardcode your RPC credentials here for chain on which you want to test (I'm using CCNG now - can share the details if needed): 
https://github.com/tonymorony/trollbox_gui/blob/master/main.py#L154
And run as python3 main.py
Then logic as in trollbox scripts (https://github.com/StakedChain/trollbox) - create nickname/oracle/subscribe if needed. 
There will nothing happen in gui on this actions in menu but you should see output in console

[03-Nov-18 10:01 PM] Alright#0419
I really need some help figuring out the logic for a chat dapp history script. I don't really have a way of grabbing the latest oraclesdatas. The only way I can think of doing it is grabbing all messages that ever happened, sorting by timestamp then printing

[03-Nov-18 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
https://github.com/StakedChain/trollbox/blob/master/history.py
I have this, but it's very flawed because it grabs the last 10 messages from all publishers, sort them and prints them

[03-Nov-18 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
but that doesn't make any sense

[03-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
as if someone says 10 messages since another person said something, messages get cut off

[03-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
basically what I need to figure out is a way of grabbing the latest oraclesdata from *all* publishers

[03-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
but not by amount like oraclessamples is right now, rather based on when they happened

[03-Nov-18 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
that history script would work if I changed 10 to the number of messages the most active publisher has ever sent

[03-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
Would it be possible to add a number in oraclesinfo that shows the amount of `oraclesdata`s a publisher has ever done?

[03-Nov-18 11:15 PM] tolken#2655
Is every ‚Äúuser‚Äù a ‚Äúpublisher‚Äù ?

[03-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[03-Nov-18 11:23 PM] tolken#2655
Are all messages timestamped?

[03-Nov-18 11:24 PM] tolken#2655
Maybe if you give me some sample data that your script is operating on I can take a look tonight.

[03-Nov-18 11:28 PM] Alright#0419
message is timestamped, yes

[03-Nov-18 11:28 PM] tolken#2655
Never mind. I‚Äôll just get a setup going to I can play. I might be able to help with some areas of this üòÉ

[03-Nov-18 11:28 PM] Alright#0419
the payload for each message is

[03-Nov-18 11:28 PM] Alright#0419
[<timestamp>, "<message>"]

[03-Nov-18 11:28 PM] Alright#0419

Hi @Mihailo ! Sorry I've missed your message regards gatewaysCC fixes PR.
I'll start re-test tomorrow and will let you know how it's going

[04-Nov-18 03:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL No problem. Ping me tomorrow if you need anything how to setup. Basically in my experience it showed that the best setup is: 1 node for al the commands on creating gateway and deposit, 3 nodes for 2of3 gateway for example, and 1 node mining.

{Reactions}

[04-Nov-18 03:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I'll try to go ahead with such setup

[04-Nov-18 03:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks!

[04-Nov-18 07:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
The reason why this setup is easier is because if you run oraclefeed on 3 nodes for 3 trusted pubkeys, they will post data often and use funds from the wallet. So if you execute some command like gatewaydeposit, when the hex is returned if you are not fast enough to broadcast it, it will use the vout you got in hex and you will not be able to broadcast that hex and will need to get another one. So bottom line I think the nodes with oraclefeed should be independent.

It started after I've broadcasted gatewaysclaim + gatewaysdeposit, before all worked correct
Tried to stop/start some nodes - no luck so far

[06-Nov-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
no guarantee mempool are in sync

[06-Nov-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but if they run different versions, they can be much out of sync

[06-Nov-18 02:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm 4 nodes have the same version, 1 of the 3 with oraclesfeed have latest with all the dices fixes
I've tried to stop/start gateways creation / deposit node - able to re-broadcast gatewaysdeposit after it but its going to "nowhere"

[06-Nov-18 02:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to re-sync blockchain now also

[06-Nov-18 03:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
I hade similair problems, basically oraclefeed nodes broadcast as many tx as you did subscribe in one block, and sometimes it can get stuck. I do not know exactly why you mining node does not get any of those txs, but be sure that all nodes are in sync...

[06-Nov-18 03:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
And also check often as mempool gets big and when block is mined everything will clear and fill again as oraclefeed posts every 10 seconds.

[06-Nov-18 03:07 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo I've subscribed 100 times for each publisher

[06-Nov-18 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
But when I just broadcasted oraclefeed all seems ok, before I've made gatewaysclaim + gatewaysdeposit.
Now mempools on broadcasting nodes seems stucked

[06-Nov-18 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway will try on new AC with very last FSM on all nodes

[06-Nov-18 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
And report if behaviour repeats

[06-Nov-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, for mempool things, latest FSM is requirement

[06-Nov-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
dice CC hadd some fatal bugs with mempool states

[07-Nov-18 11:38 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c have I create a new oracle for proper testing? (getting same error now)

[07-Nov-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
do you get identical console prints?

[07-Nov-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810

let me revert a change

[07-Nov-18 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, its there

[07-Nov-18 11:42 AM] TonyL#3577
building

[07-Nov-18 11:48 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Oh, was there only reversion? Since error is the same

[07-Nov-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
can you test another usage of oracles?

[07-Nov-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt change oracles except for making sure of proper funcdid

[07-Nov-18 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, before I've updated nodes today oraclefeed worked smooth (on yesterdays commits)
Will try oracles chatting now

[07-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
or just some very basic unit tests

[07-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
where there a lot of changes when you first updated today?

[07-Nov-18 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes were a lot of changes in CCs and RPCs

[07-Nov-18 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh tests, we have tests,  right üòÉ

[07-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
seems something broke before today

[07-Nov-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is best if you update more frequent, that way it really narrows down what change broke things

[07-Nov-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, will make a rule for myself now check `git pull` each day before starting do stuff

[07-Nov-18 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
```"error": "odds must be between 2 and 9999"```
Are odds 2 now means the same as odds 1 before?
