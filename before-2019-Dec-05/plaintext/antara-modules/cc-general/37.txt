[09-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
it would have reorged 1000+ blocks worth of txs if we kept AT1

[09-Aug-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright thanks for the reminder, i was just being lazy by using it still 😃

[09-Aug-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's nice to compare what AT1/AT2 gives me versus regtest

[09-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c the thing I described yesterday is reproducible. If I start a node from scratch with new wallet and new pubkey and fund the pubkey, the cc commands don't work properly. 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT2 rewardslock 0time 062211921373a002306628024d2ac0c912b79ace5baed673473b1325e87e7006 100

```

[09-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
once I get this node to mine a block, it works fine

[09-Aug-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
does it have normal inputs?

[09-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
The tx that I funded the pubkey address with?

[09-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
was `sendtoaddress` from my other node

[09-Aug-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i think I see, it needs p2pk inputs

[09-Aug-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
not p2pkh. i will fix this tomorrow

[09-Aug-18 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
my tests only test the mining pathway, not the bug that Alright just found

[09-Aug-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I think another way, is if you have normal funds received and then send a tx, the change becomes of the right form

[09-Aug-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so sendtoaddress funds dont work directly?

[09-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
do not

[09-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
will try to send coins from this wallet and use the change

[09-Aug-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, it sort of makes sense

[09-Aug-18 09:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have some nice error checking of edge cases added to faucetfund which i will add to other similar rpc's

[09-Aug-18 09:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
i've merged the latest `jl777` branch into `cctests`

[09-Aug-18 09:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
all tests passing with the latest `jl777` changes 👍

[09-Aug-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i read that rewards CC was having problems with p2pkh utxo

[09-Aug-18 09:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c does it make sense to do a check in `faucetfund` that the amount is <= the current wallet mature balance, or maybe not since the xtn can be broadcasted at  a different time when the balance is different?

[09-Aug-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i figure if you try to fund more than you have, it wont work and get an error

[09-Aug-18 10:09 PM] Mylo#8306
fundamount as a string got me when testing remote rpc

[09-Aug-18 10:09 PM] Mylo#8306
good morning ☕

[10-Aug-18 05:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
that error is new to me, i get it when i try to broadcast the hex returned by faucetfund

[10-Aug-18 05:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
```1187-        if (vInOutPoints.count(txin.prevout))

[10-Aug-18 05:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
i almost know what that is trying to do. it's saying that one vout was tried to be used multiple times in 1 transaction?

[10-Aug-18 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
look at the vins, likely there is a duplicate. how did you create the rawtx?

[10-Aug-18 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
decode the rawtx to make sure it does have identical vin.i and vin.j

[10-Aug-18 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the strange thing is there is a duplicate filter so it shouldnt happen unless there is a bug in the duplicate filter

[10-Aug-18 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, wait. there is a possibility of this. fixing

[10-Aug-18 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix

[10-Aug-18 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont fix the already generated rawtx with duplicates, but if the wallet has a duplicate utxo in it, it will filter it out

[10-Aug-18 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
all i did was mine blocks in regtest, then call `faucetfund "1"`

[10-Aug-18 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
then try to `sendrawtransaction` that hex

[10-Aug-18 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright is rewardslock the only one with problems using p2pkh utxo?

[10-Aug-18 06:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is the relevant wallet/faucet info

[10-Aug-18 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto I added duplicate filter for the case where the wallet is returning the same utxo more than once. I assumed that couldnt happen, but apparently it did

[10-Aug-18 06:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
well, these tests are proving useful already

[10-Aug-18 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
plz try latest version, preferably with the identical chain in the identical test

[10-Aug-18 06:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
i will merge it in right now

[10-Aug-18 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
your specific utxo set is a bit part of how this bug was exposed, so if that changes, it could be the bug goes away

[10-Aug-18 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, any automated tests will be very useful

[10-Aug-18 06:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
just merged in jl777 branch, compiled, and waiting for tests to finish 😃

[10-Aug-18 06:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c your fixed worked, the exact same tests now pass

[10-Aug-18 06:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
i finally funded a faucet in regtest, now i can test various other RPCs

[10-Aug-18 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
actually 1 isnt enough

[10-Aug-18 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
as faucetget needs 1 + txfee

[10-Aug-18 06:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
is that value in assetoshis? if so, should `funding` be an integer?

[10-Aug-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
funding is in coins with 8 decimals

[10-Aug-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
only assets are in satoshis in some cases

[10-Aug-18 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
all the other CC use floating point (as strings) for amounts

[10-Aug-18 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
the reason assets are in satoshis is that they are creating colored utxo and tracking each one is critical

[10-Aug-18 06:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
that makes sense

[10-Aug-18 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i think some assets rpc calls are using the "wrong" denomination (coins instead of satoshis), mostly because I just cut and pasted the argv[] handling

[10-Aug-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
we are early enough and there are no GUI using CC yet, so feel free to fix things to make it more consistent

[10-Aug-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
these initial CC are just that, the initial ones

[10-Aug-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
reference implementations to show what can be done and how it is done

[10-Aug-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
many mistakes were made as it was the first batch

[10-Aug-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
my goal was minimum viable functionality

[10-Aug-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
which I believe they have

[10-Aug-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
considering assets has most of counterparty functionality

[10-Aug-18 06:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
i will definitely be adding more error checking and friendlier JSON responses for errors, and probably RPC docs

[10-Aug-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
also not sure of any other realtime dice games that are blockchain enforced

[10-Aug-18 06:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is a sneaky bug that I had to fix, with uint64_t

[10-Aug-18 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
what bug with uint64_t?

[10-Aug-18 06:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
when I did a printf(%li), it shows a negative number for it, but foo < 0 returns false, because it's a uint

just as a heads up to anybody who runs the CC tests, if you CRTL-C the test or it fails very hard (not just a test failure), the regtest komodod will still be running in the background and you must manually kill it

[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i may have spoke too soon and I am seeing non-deterministic failures, i.e. it only fails sometimes with bad-txns-inputs-duplicate

[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
i made sure to `make clean` and build from scratch

[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
need to see the failing rawtx

[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why i said your exact utxo set is a key part of the test and any changes to it could change the result

[10-Aug-18 07:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
hmm

[10-Aug-18 07:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
i always seem to get the exact same amount of `balance` from my mined blocks, i haven't changed that

[10-Aug-18 07:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
i assumed that i got the same utxo structure for each test. But I also changed the test to do `faucetfund 2` instead of `1`. I will get a failing output, it seems to fail less then half the time for me

[10-Aug-18 07:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
it takes 2 mins to run the tests and i am trying to generate a failure again
