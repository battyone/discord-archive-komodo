Such as OUTPUT1 on TX2

[30-Sep-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
txfees are usually 0.0001

[30-Sep-18 07:31 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
I'm a bit confused as to why there are 8 missing KMD at the end though.

[30-Sep-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure who made that graphic, it does appear to be technically correct

[30-Sep-18 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the graphic is wrong about the amounts

[30-Sep-18 07:35 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Perfect. Thank you for taking the time.
I'm working on the infographic competition and was confused regarding this issue. I'm glad that's clarified.

[01-Oct-18 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Strange gateway `totalsupply` `remaining` about which I wrote yesterday (pls let me know if you need hexes as well) :
1) Creating token with supply 1 (*10^8):
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 tokencreate KMD 1 Testing <- hex
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 sendrawtransaction hex <- 339c3c1d131a20a3670605a0506979a178745bbef0f6464c07eb592ee295e251
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 tokeninfo 339c3c1d131a20a3670605a0506979a178745bbef0f6464c07eb592ee295e251
{
  "result": "success",
  "tokenid": "339c3c1d131a20a3670605a0506979a178745bbef0f6464c07eb592ee295e251",
  "owner": "03431a95c761c491e38a891425009cff5f9eaa3aa3d3d4945dd17f3d0bfcff2590",
  "name": "KMD",
  "supply": 100000000,
  "description": "Testing"
}
```

2) Converting token supply (since `tokenconvert` using  tokentransfer I assume that I have to declare supply as 1 * 10^8): 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 tokenconvert 241 339c3c1d131a20a3670605a0506979a178745bbef0f6464c07eb592ee295e251 03ea9c062b9652d8eff34879b504eda0717895d27597aaeb60347d65eed96ccb40 100000000 <- hex
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 sendrawtransaction hex <- ecb8e0e49288b0b9eefa52e82497aa60704eabd4820accd8fdd968228f714b30```

[01-Oct-18 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
3) Binding gateway (using pre-created oracle with Ihh data type):
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewaysbind 339c3c1d131a20a3670605a0506979a178745bbef0f6464c07eb592ee295e251 8bea86f9c6cbf35cb3f443dcb39dd84b499871a86a40f26f8abdd1e4b198c07f KMD 100000000 1 1 03431a95c761c491e38a891425009cff5f9eaa3aa3d3d4945dd17f3d0bfcff2590 <- hex
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 sendrawtransaction hex <- 1bc88a3ece1e385d5ff504ad445254d90505cfbbd1ad85350e5c8ef132c586c7
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewaysinfo 1bc88a3ece1e385d5ff504ad445254d90505cfbbd1ad85350e5c8ef132c586c7

}
```

[01-Oct-18 01:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Also I noticed that I can broadcast more than one `gatewaysbind` with same parameters in one block and as result can have more than one gateway with same token/oracle binded. Should I consider it as expected behaviour? 
A lil bit scary to imagine what will happen if multiply gateway will use same token for back and forth converts 😃

[01-Oct-18 01:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Also as I've reported before `oraclesfeed` keep trying to broadcast withdrawal which was successfully completed for another gateway. 
To reproduce just have to complete tokens withdrawal (with successful KMD receiving) and run `oraclefeed` to oraclize for any oracle/gateway on same pubkey node as which made successful withdrawal:
```./oraclefeed ORCL1 8bea86f9c6cbf35cb3f443dcb39dd84b499871a86a40f26f8abdd1e4b198c07f 03431a95c761c491e38a891425009cff5f9eaa3aa3d3d4945dd17f3d0bfcff2590 Ihh 25d44838bad71592c2a8ffb1bb31e7a17e10fa34631df8246846ccf7fe72d470

[01-Oct-18 01:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Looks like a minor thing since it's just a dAPP issue - not consensus one but In case of big completed withdrawals amount it will be a huuge mess-up in `oraclesfeed` printouts and RPC spam.

@SHossain  @TonyL I am starting to document the rpc calls of cc contracts. Can you correct me if  any of the below statements are false:
1) dice, token, faucet, rewards are all currently active on the komodo mainchain
2) https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions/tree/master/docs this location has the most uptodate info on these
3)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l0dWEPcrv9zE11_TD-XrX_HIYV0VLpadCJN6hvaZERc/edit#gid=821923243 -- this doc has latest explanations

Please post links to any other docs/guides that have been written for these contracts

Once I have the docs for the above contracts ready, I will start working on the next ones

http://pad.supernet.org/cc_gateways_guide I've almost finished how-to for gatewaysCC (it's using tokens, oracles, gateways CCs + oraclefeed dAPP). But it's just an adoption of James github hints.

Got it.

[01-Oct-18 10:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Feel free to buzz me if you'll encounter some difficulties/doubts with RPC calls - always glad to help 👍

[01-Oct-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
a chain with -ac_cc=N with N > 0, will have CC active

[01-Oct-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if N > 100, then it forms a cluster and all other chains in that cluster are fungible

[01-Oct-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if N is 1, then it just enables CC

[01-Oct-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if N is > 1 and <= 100, it allows for non-fungible cross chain within the cluster

[01-Oct-18 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh looks like this info not documented anywhere but it's like a most important `step 0` when architecting asset chain / cluster with CCs support

[01-Oct-18 10:19 AM] TonyL#3577
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/example-asset-chains.html 
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html
there is no even parameter `ac_cc` in these docs - I guess it's have to be refreshed with taking into account the possibility of creating a CC

[01-Oct-18 10:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe write some handbook like a `Hands-on Komodo blockchain infrastructure architecting with crypto-conditions Turing-complete smart-contracts`

We can start from advices on servers choosing, asset chain requirements for CCs support and include how-to usage guide for each CC with thoughts on real-life / business cases application

[01-Oct-18 10:29 AM] TonyL#3577
If it's a good idea - I may create some initial draft as soon as finish with gatewaysCC automation

[01-Oct-18 10:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Something like an adoption of James CCs development WP but targeting on architects and users (more wide audience in general and with aim on usage description rather then development/creation) with examples and pictures to fill the gap in mass-understanding

[01-Oct-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes Alright would be the most familiar with this topic

[01-Oct-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
@jl777c Also I noticed that I can broadcast more than one gatewaysbind with same parameters in one block and as result can have more than one gateway with same token/oracle binded. Should I consider it as expected behaviour? 
part of the gatewaysbind process should be to make sure no other with the same name was created in the same block
since no economic activity is done the moment of bind, it is a matter to do a bind, verify not duplicate, if there was, do anotherbind, etc.

[01-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
tokenconvert operates on tokens, so specify the total satoshis

[01-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I realized different rpc are using different convention, I try to keep it so when doing tokens it is at the satoshi level, when dealing with the native coin, then it is float

[01-Oct-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if I violate that rule, then it is a bug

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL oraclesregister 47f317d9d140eb622d22b352cea1b0f531ee0a477d560acc885432b167f61ee6 10000
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 oraclessubscribe 47f317d9d140eb622d22b352cea1b0f531ee0a477d560acc885432b167f61ee6 036fe66a54d40b0146bcbf6627064cf023be5bfbb7a4bd5fd390007e5ddb801d13 10000
```
Seems like a 20000 which have `maker` wallet:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 getaddressbalance '{"addresses": ["RMjyWM1BMG3pVkeX39Bx5qAFw1dJsT2YMy"]}'
{
  "balance": 20000,
  "received": 20000
}```

you can always look at the rawtx to answer such questions

you dont need me for that

[01-Oct-18 01:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, I think I got the point - UTXO is an answer 😃

[01-Oct-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if you need to know what the code is trying to do, there are the code comments

@SHossain run oraclefeed and it's trying to broadcast my successful withdrawal transaction which I made few days ago.
So it's different reproducing as I thought - even no matter which privkey node have it's trying to re-brodcast succesfully completed withdrawal

[01-Oct-18 04:32 PM] TonyL#3577
And @SHossain used brand new gateway without any deposit/withdrawal transactions for this `oraclefeed` execution

[01-Oct-18 04:37 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/cc/dapps/oraclefeed.c#L470 btw isn't it should get `bindtxid` instead of `oracletxid`?

yes, it is using bindtxid, just the variable name is wrong

[01-Oct-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed in the code, but it wont change behavior

[01-Oct-18 04:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, I see

[01-Oct-18 04:45 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess what we see is this execution https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/cc/dapps/oraclefeed.c#L843

the oraclefeed node needs to be able to spend that

[01-Oct-18 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
So `oraclefeed` marker now just monitoring for all transactions which looks like gateways withdrawals and trying to execute no matter which pubkey it belongs

[01-Oct-18 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess there is no problem so

[01-Oct-18 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm really sorry if I made buzz from nothing. Really missed in these things a little bit last days 😂

[01-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
well cant stop invalid nodes from trying

[01-Oct-18 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
I just wonder that it's maybe a problem for node if AC live for a long time

[01-Oct-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it works for the valid node(s) it is not a bug

{Reactions}
👌 

[01-Oct-18 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
And there are millions of succesfull transactions

[01-Oct-18 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
So `oraclefeed` will try to rebroadcast each

[01-Oct-18 04:59 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's hypothetical thing for now

[01-Oct-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i just merged mihailo's channels CC implementation. He said it is ready to test, but he doubts any of you will find any bugs as his code is totally perfect

[01-Oct-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
