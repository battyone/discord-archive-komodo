let me know how I can help write some tests

[05-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
Whoops, didn't realize I left that faucet script running

[05-Aug-18 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
That error -25 is just a result of someone else doing it before you at that block height

[05-Aug-18 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain

[05-Aug-18 03:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So its one faucettx per block?

[05-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[05-Aug-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
shossain's test plan is the best testplan I have ever seen for CC contracts

[05-Aug-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
of course as soon as it is improved, then it is being improved

[05-Aug-18 05:03 PM] SHossain#0007
Thanks James. I'll get the rest of the RPC calls done along with summary page üòÉ

[05-Aug-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
one easy way to expand a test plan is to make sure each bug found has a specific test point, so if we had the test plan, we are sure to find it. and even if it isnt a bug, what works now might break later, so each bug usually gives an idea to several test points

[05-Aug-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
for each rpc call being tested there is a set of test points, with several different "time to do the test" and "severity of bug", clearly we want to front load the quick to run tests that finds major fatal issues before even starting on tests that take avery long time to find minor bugs

[05-Aug-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
testing is a resource allocation problem

[05-Aug-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
given infinite resources, just test everything with each release.

[05-Aug-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but this is not practical

[05-Aug-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so the goal is to get as close to the same result as if we are testing everything with every release

[05-Aug-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
though with automated tests it would be possible to come really close to this

[05-Aug-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
even with manual testing in prioritized order it should be possible to come reasonably close

[05-Aug-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and the ultimate result is whether we find all the important to fix bugs before it is released

[05-Aug-18 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
Miners can censor faucetget txs other than their own for each block they mine.  I feel as if faucetget will just be dominated by miners.

[05-Aug-18 06:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
isn't it a PoC? surely it can be improved.... but isnt all crypto dominated by miners

[05-Aug-18 06:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[05-Aug-18 06:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, the first of these 4 are demo/example CC contracts.

[05-Aug-18 06:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to help newbies like me understand and get started.

[05-Aug-18 06:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not there yet, but I will try to replicate the faucet CC in Go language.

[05-Aug-18 06:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that will be my learning lesson for C++/Go/Blockchain/CC

[05-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
any ideas for preventing it becoming essentially just a second coinbase for miners

[05-Aug-18 06:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
stop miners

we need to confirm **rewardsunlock** call working properly (unlocks the locked funds and delivers the APR)

we can add up more columns if needed for detailed bug reports

[05-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Alright#0419
`rewardscreatefunding` needs minimums.  `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT1 rewardscreatefunding spam 0 0 0 0 0` works fine

[05-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Alright#0419

@dukeleto use your notary pubkey if you haven't

the one in ~/SuperNET/iguana/pubkey.txt will be valid

[06-Aug-18 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo this is for regtest, i should be able to use any pubkey in the wallet, no? I am probably misunderstanding something
