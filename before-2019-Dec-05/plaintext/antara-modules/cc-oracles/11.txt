Topic: This channel is for discussion and announcements surrounding the oracles crypto condition contract. Please feel free to answer any questions, technical or non-technical. The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.

Maybe decentralized oracle, or solution for oracle data validation?

[24-Oct-19 02:46 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, I'll look into those.  Thanks a lot, @Mihailo 🙇

[24-Oct-19 05:02 PM] gcharang#6833
we have a decentralized oracle too; based on making miners submit the data and nodes validate it
we are using it in Prices-cc I think

Hi @Sarahz, I saw you asking about oracles in #ask-jl777.  This channel is a good place to ask more about them. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator knows a lot about them and wrote a good article here: `https://blog.komodoplatform.com/anatomy-of-an-oracle-c6c2245b0196` .  The pinned 📌 messages ☝ also have some information.
Please ask if you have any questions 😄

[02-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Sarahz#0662
@CrisF ok ty and sorry

[02-Nov-19 01:34 PM] CrisF#3405
why sorry?

[02-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Sarahz#0662
Wrong chan for ask oracle

[02-Nov-19 01:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, didn't mean that.  Good to ask jl777 👍 I just wanted to point out more info.

[02-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Sarahz#0662
Oracles will be implemented in smartchain komodo maybe he is in the roadmap ?

[02-Nov-19 01:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Oracles are already here.  Have been used for quite a long time.

[02-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Sarahz#0662
Oh ok

[02-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Sarahz#0662
Idk

[02-Nov-19 01:38 PM] CrisF#3405
If you go here: `https://docs.komodoplatform.com/` and search oracles you will find info on how to set them up.

[02-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Sarahz#0662
Ok thanks for information

[02-Nov-19 01:39 PM] CrisF#3405
The cc-* channels on the left are channels for the different Antara Modules where you can ask questions and search.

[02-Nov-19 01:40 PM] CrisF#3405
Please ask if you have any questions.  Many people here will be happy to help.

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Oracles CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!

couple dapps in the pinned message here, @Regnar 
LABS uses oracles CC pretty extensively. Have a NN voting dapp and the LABS NN lottery dapp, among others

@Mihailo Found an interesting edge case. If you'll try to create oracle of `s` type with description > 4096 symbols daemon will deadly hangs and only kill/restart helps
Example of such call: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/HM9kpFq7Xm/
What is interesting that if you'll try with data type lets say `L` - it'll work fine (```{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "oracles description must be <= 4096 characters"
}
```)
happy coincidence that in description test was `s` type 😅
(tested on latest FSM)

[07-Nov-19 08:27 AM] TonyL#3577
And one more edge case. After such call (too long oracle name):
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL oraclescreate sdsadsafdsafwaerewafesafewarfewarwavsfdsafdsfdsaf test s
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "oracles name must not be empty and up to 32 characters"
}
```
my next RPC call hangs the daemon and I never get a response and have to kill it

[07-Nov-19 08:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
Nice, I'll check it out!

[07-Nov-19 09:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, found the problem.

[07-Nov-19 09:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
PRed the fix to FSM!

[07-Nov-19 10:04 AM] Mihailo#5902
It seems that some other RPCs have the same problem. As we introduced different locking mechanism to support remote rpc call on nSPV there must be changes in rpc checks for parametars validity.

[07-Nov-19 10:05 AM] Mihailo#5902
@dimxy When we changed from LOCK2 to ENTER_CRITICAL_SECTION and LEAVE_CRITICAL_SECTION, there must be no returns or exception throws in between those two.

[07-Nov-19 10:08 AM] Mihailo#5902
The advantage of using LOCK2 was that it was working until the end of the block and you could have all the returns and throws after it.

[07-Nov-19 10:08 AM] dimxy#2587
no returns, otherwise it remains in the locked state

[07-Nov-19 10:09 AM] Mihailo#5902
Now we need to leave cs beofre each return/throws or have none of them until leave cs.

[07-Nov-19 10:09 AM] dimxy#2587
it is like begin and end, if there is a 'begin' then it must be a 'end'

[07-Nov-19 10:10 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes I know, just saying that I missed the returns and throws because there was a lot of RPCs I changed and basically I went through them fast and copy/paste  stuff.

[07-Nov-19 10:12 AM] dimxy#2587
I just thought we could use lambdas and use one time a lambda with LOCK2 and second time without it

[07-Nov-19 10:12 AM] TonyL#3577
I hope that  today-tomorrow I’ll finish with rpc unit tests rework and it’s integration into CI process so we’ll catch such things on PRs opening

👍 

[07-Nov-19 10:14 AM] Mihailo#5902
I would like that we have some kind of CI checks as there is a lot various stuff we are working on and cannot remember everything that might be affected

💯 

[07-Nov-19 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah things you guys creating are more and more complex and beautiful each time so better defense needed
