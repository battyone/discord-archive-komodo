Topic: This channel is for discussion and announcements surrounding the oracles crypto condition contract. Please feel free to answer any questions, technical or non-technical. The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.

Will do some performance stress tests as soon as uploader/downloader will be feature full - it will allow us to describe use-cases directions with current functionality I guess. Thanks for an interesting questions raising@Mylo !

Oracles are pretty fast, what can be slow is if there is lots of Oracle tx in a single block. My streamer didn't use oracles. Just the raw data in op return

txid lookup is what takes the time

[04-Jan-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
then iterating backwards using the txid vin as linked list

[04-Jan-19 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
total number of oracles wont matter, the nunber of simultaneous access would

[05-Jan-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm can't publish 63999 bytes data (https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/H3b4FZ3sff/) to D type oracle.
Getting an error ```datasize 64001 is too big
{'result': 'error', 'error': 'datasize 64001 is too big'}```

[05-Jan-19 07:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Shouldn't it fit 65536 bytes?

when i said max size was 10000 for OPRETURN, that meant that 10000 is the most that will fit in an opreturn

[05-Jan-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
yes that prevents making horrible oversized things

[05-Jan-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
just because it is 16 bits doesnt mean you can max out the bits

[05-Jan-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
using that logic, any 64 bit param would mean you can use (1<<64) -1

8 KB file published to D 👌 
Will split data on 8 KB chunks so

[05-Jan-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
If I'm ensuring the sequence with which `oraclesdata` transactions getting to mempool is it enough to be sure that  `oraclesdata` sequence in oracle will be in same order in which I'm sending it? 
Making kinda protocol for broadcast - not sure if data chunk number encoding in data overkill or not 🤔  For now monitoring mempool seems to be enough - but maybe there is some other factors might happen in production - like a mempools synchronisation over the nodes

[05-Jan-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
800 KB file succesfully published in one block :3040_kingpeepo: (actually 2 blocks needed - one on oracle creation/preparation - second on uploading itself)

[05-Jan-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it should only be able to be mined in sequence, or at least all tx in a block would be referring to other tx in a block. otherwise it would be invalid input

[05-Jan-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with my experiance .. if your making a heap of txns that are dependant.. you need to mine them too... otherwise they dont propagate the mempoool

[06-Jan-19 12:04 AM] Mylo#8306
Out of order packets in (VoIP/video) network terminology is called jitter.  That kind of software uses a jitter buffer to reassemble/reorder packets into correct order.   Just an fyi

@Mylo @TonyL do you know the overhead for uploading files to an oracle?

[08-Jan-19 11:02 PM] Alright#0419
I was thinking if it's significant, it might be better to use the full OP_RETURN without the contract at all

[09-Jan-19 12:20 AM] Mylo#8306
no idea, something we'll check out.   also do you know if a file in an oracle is saved on a node in pruned mode?

[09-Jan-19 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
don't believe it would be. I'm not familiar with what "pruned mode" is, but I think it would prune all OP_RETURNs

[09-Jan-19 12:23 AM] Mylo#8306
yep it does.

[09-Jan-19 05:38 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright
txfee for oraclescreate
txfee for oraclesregister
txfee for oraclessubscribe/s (+ topup on sum of chunks * datafee on this change) 
txfee + datafee for each oraclesdata

[09-Jan-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
so what I mean is if you upload a 100kb file

[09-Jan-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
how much space does that actually use on the chain

[09-Jan-19 05:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, I though you're asking how much is it cost

[09-Jan-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using just the OP_RETURN like I did in the streamer make 10% more space. Thats putting a txd and a int32 at the start for identificatino purpousess....if using an oracle isnt much mroe than that, oracle is better as you can locate it inothe chain faster.

[09-Jan-19 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
different use case

[09-Jan-19 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
but yea

[09-Jan-19 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
i believe ya

[09-Jan-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
oracles put less data as overhead

[09-Jan-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by 10% more I mean if you make a chain with only a file in it... the raw blockchain is 10% bigger in total... not sure how a raw op_return can be bigger than an oracle?

[09-Jan-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
oracle uses vin for indexing

[09-Jan-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so oracle has whole op_return used aswell?

[09-Jan-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, it does add some txids, so adds 64 bytes

{Reactions}
👍 

[09-Jan-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but compared to 8kb it is small percentage

[09-Jan-19 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
streamer was only 1 txid ... so liekly they are much the same.

[09-Jan-19 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
streamer has no index though.... hard to find files in current state

The format of oraclessubscribe is: `oraclessubscribe oracletxid publisher amount`

1)The amount can be anything greater than datafee correct? 
2)Say datafee is 10 COINS and the amount 1000 COINS is used to subscribe, the publisher will be able to publish 100 times. Is it correct?
3) What happens if the amount used to subscribe is 1001 COINS, I mean 1 COIN will be leftover, If the same pubkey does oraclessubscribe with 9 COINS, will the publisher able to publish once?

[07-Feb-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
unless bugs, it should work that way

[07-Feb-19 11:23 AM] Mihailo#5902
@gcharang Yes, Only for 3) I would have to check...

[07-Feb-19 12:26 PM] gcharang#6833
Thanks, one more question:
If the datafee is 10 COINS as above, but pubkeyA subscribes with 1 COIN and pubkeyB subscribes with 9 COINS. will the publisher be able to publish then?

[07-Feb-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, funds are paid to the publisher pubkey CC address

I found this mistake in the `oraclesdata` method today and I don't know what information is missing:

Look for the `===`

```
Data is submitted using the hexstr property. The first portion of the hexstr property must include ===; this sets the string length for the rest of the data. The second portion of the hexstr property is the data itself.
```

Can anyone here please tell me what the first part of the hexstr property should include?

[21-Feb-19 04:26 AM] gcharang#6833
Its in this section: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-oracles.html#oraclesdata
afaik it should be the `data type`

lets wait for @Alright or @TonyL to answer this @Bryan_Beus
