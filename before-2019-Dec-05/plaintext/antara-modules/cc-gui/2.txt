923am - not wasting time.  the komodo-rpc-lib in js needs writing and dev-testing anyway...dev docs. and cc need guis.  we'll have one my lunchtime working, maybe afternoon tea.

Do you have link to your TUI so i can have a look at it please? I am about to start on a chat program for STAKEDTROLL maybe that wil give me son inspiration

[10-Oct-18 07:24 AM] Mylo#8306

Will look at it too. Only bash scripting here but I really want to learn python.

python definatly seems easier over all.

[12-Oct-18 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but bash is much better at some things... for staked, I used a combination of both, it looks messy but its very simple.

@TonyL suggestion for your TUI
Convert `subprocess from check_output` to xmlrpc client and your TUI will be available to remote servers

I usually rape check_output() by decode() and rstrip() and then do json.loads() to work as with dictionary

[12-Oct-18 09:35 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo So if I'll implement this my TUI will make RPC calls to komodod and remote servers will able to make RPC calls to my TUI? Like a interlayer

[12-Oct-18 09:52 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes.  Like TUI will be useful from host -> docker as well.
Further, in the case of @blackjok3r TROLL chat chain, if you were to have a config TUI section (e.g. press 1 to configure, enter host, enter port, enter user, enter pass) he could run XX TUI processes in his tmux fantasy land and chat to himself to his hearts content across nodes üòõ

[12-Oct-18 09:55 AM] Mylo#8306
By removing the need to be ‚Äúon localhost‚Äù calling sub-process stuff and making it all within your py process and json network comms, you can then also think about making stuff with https://kivy.org/#home

I would create a small test.py script, use a json-rpc library with `getinfo` to make sure you can do it to localhost.   Then try from localhost -> docker.   Then convert TUI to that method, maybe in a new branch.  `git checkout -b networkcomms` whilst in dev

Cool, all new functions for my "library" I wrote to be not demand on from where input coming (TUI actually just implementation of this "library" with keyboard args input). So it should be scalable and easy to change for needed args receiving by RPC, or somewhere else). Can go ahead with RPC integration as soon as finish with gatewaysCC multisig testing process

[12-Oct-18 10:15 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes best way to make stuff you probably know MVC pattern (model view controller).  As a GUI, one of the kivy featured projects looks like this.   I would guess they have a good separation-of-concerns making GUI separate from any logic being an academic application for researchers - it looks good from the menu, it may give you an easy head start to making TUI a GUI - even with sub-process if you didn‚Äôt want to do the network comms part.  https://trifusion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html

If anything it might give you hints

I've played with Yii framework few years ago, can imagine what MVC is but it's need full time concentration to make usable product ohh

Hehe yes.  But it‚Äôs a very necessary part in the development cycle, quick iterations.
MVC,
Model = database
View = GUI
Controller = your library

Blockchain, View, Tony‚Äôs Library.   Same application architecture, your library is what komodo-rpc-lib is in JavaScript when done with json-rpc.

At the moment python in the browser is not popular but it looks like steps in making python->WASM (web assembly) is already happening.

The more generalized rpc-libs in different languages the more availability to developers to make applications.  Js, python.   Splitting python workload across a few community members and the 200+ komodo RPC methods will be done.

[12-Oct-18 10:38 AM] Mylo#8306
Also the beauty is with a komodo-rpc-lib-js & komodo-rpc-lib-py they are compatible with VRSC.  Taking to the next step, because kmd rpc has more than other coins, the libraries can be used for other coins (with some configuration modification).  And re-using james‚Äô bitmask calculations, where:
KMD = 1
VRSC = 2
ZEC= 4
HUSH = 8
EMC2 = 16

A method in the rpc library with a compatibility value of ‚Äú3‚Äù could be called for a KMD/VRSC application.   If a different method (say MoMoM) has a value of 27, then all but ZEC supports this method call for a GUI application to use.
```
0001 1011 <‚Äî from R to L (right to left), KMD, VRSC, ZEC, HUSH, EMC2 
```

[12-Oct-18 10:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Use the bits as switches (on/off) for support.  Assign each bit to a coin.  Whether it can be used with the method.

@Bryan_Beus read up a bit and that's the gist of what we are doing in both js and python.  fill in the gaps where you want/can - the js code has stubbed out methods waiting for implementation.  the python stuff needs porting from sub-process (spawning an external command) to network commands.   and we're off to the races!

that's the pattern repeated for stuff that doesn't have any arguments.   for stuff that does, just a matter of passing it in, and `resolve(resp)` it.

Hi @Mylo ! Your gist worked for me with some additional dependencies before execute ` pip3 install "jsonrpcclient[requests]"`
 ```sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools 
pip3 install wheel```

Have same error with schema validation. Looks like it's not python problem but validation when matching with this schema http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema

As I understand Komodo RPC uses JSON-RPC 1.0 interface while this lib works only with JSON-RPC 2.0 and matching with this schema 

Tried to disable schema verification:
`response = client.send('{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "method": "getinfo", "id": 1, "params": []}', verify=False,  headers={"content-type": "application/json-rpc"})` but same error

Gonna search for another rpc lib

I want to make Python RPC library similar to this https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib on top of this one https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc
And thinking now regards code organisation to make it really usable.
What is the best practice to include this  https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc library to mine and how better place my modules for different stuff?
I wonder maybe there is some PEP recommendations for such stuff.
Thank you in advance!

@TonyL Have a look on https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib which does not support only rpc but also other tools, e.g. for wallet, signing messages...

Thanks @patchkez will try this one

@TonyL I am not so good in object programming, but I would try to import python-bitcoinlib as a module into your project and override classes with changes specific for KMD

[17-Oct-18 08:00 AM] patchkez#5349
that way, you can consume python-bitcoinlib with all new improvements he introduces and do not have to cherry pick his commits into your repo

[17-Oct-18 08:00 AM] patchkez#5349
maybe @Deleted User has other ideas

https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinlib/blob/master/bitcoin/rpc.py#L83 @patchkez yeah, looks like there is a wide amount of places which should be adopted for Komodo
