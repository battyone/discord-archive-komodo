Something very bad happened locally I wonder because it worked fine before from same bundle

[25-Mar-19 06:33 PM] TonyL#3577
@wookie If steps which I've proposed above not helped - please backup current `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE/wallet.dat`, save privkeys (dumprivkey %address%) for addresses with funds / warriors and then delete:
```~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE ```
Or you can instead of ROGUE folder deletion backup it:
```mv ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE_backup```

Then start daemon and import old wallet privkey/s `importprivkey %privkey%`

[25-Mar-19 06:34 PM] TonyL#3577

@TonyL did as you suggested. deleted bundle, restart pc, unzipped 0.4.0rc again. started daemon then run tui. 
still got this error trying to start new game:
>> 6
Something went wrong.

Also, on the daemon window, got this output when I ran tui and started new game:

@wookie Try to purge ROGUE folder after wallet backup

[25-Mar-19 06:53 PM] wookie#7663
ok

[25-Mar-19 06:54 PM] wookie#7663
sorry what's the full command for dumpriv key? is it ./komodo-cli dumprivkey [address]?

[25-Mar-19 06:54 PM] TonyL#3577
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE dumpprivkey [address]` (since you backing up your ROGUE chain wallet)

[25-Mar-19 06:56 PM] wookie#7663
so I ran that but it keeps telling me this:
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)

[25-Mar-19 06:56 PM] wookie#7663
but my daemon IS running

[25-Mar-19 06:56 PM] wookie#7663
I'm executing the dumprivkey inside the bundle folder, as is the daemon (in a different window)

[25-Mar-19 06:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe daemon crashed or hanged

[25-Mar-19 06:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Try to `pgrep komodod`

[25-Mar-19 06:58 PM] TonyL#3577
And if there is any output: `pkill komodod`

[25-Mar-19 06:58 PM] wookie#7663
output: 1753

[25-Mar-19 06:58 PM] wookie#7663
I just started the daemon a minute before trying dumprivkey, I waited until it said "finished loading blocks"

[25-Mar-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
use FSM for now

{Reactions}
👌 

[25-Mar-19 06:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Then if after `pkill komodod` no output in `pgrep komodod` 
Try to start ROGUE daemon again, and then check if you'll able to `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo`

[25-Mar-19 07:00 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c wookie using daemon from bundle built 3 days ago (if your advice was not general but connected to this particular case)

[25-Mar-19 07:00 PM] wookie#7663
did the pkill, no output, restarted daemon, then executed getinfo:

dumprivkey still gives error

[25-Mar-19 07:01 PM] TonyL#3577
It's obviously gives error now because you have 0 blocks and 0 connections

[25-Mar-19 07:03 PM] wookie#7663
after I ran daemon, I waited until:
finished loading blocks ROGUE

got this output in the daemon window when ran getinfo:
OS_loadfile null size.(/Users/xxxx/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE/komodostate)
komodo_faststateinit retval.-1

[25-Mar-19 07:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Try to temporary backup whole ROGUE folder (move to other place = copy to other place and delete in /Users/xxxx/Library/Application Support/Komodo/) and try to start daemon again

[25-Mar-19 07:04 PM] wookie#7663
ok

[25-Mar-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean now, as jl777 branch is under construction

[25-Mar-19 07:16 PM] wookie#7663
I removed the old ROGUE folder and started daemon from a fresh copy of 0.4.0rc. I got all this output in 1 second:
Komodo ROGUE server starting
3165-AL-00104:rogue8c xxx$ set addressindex, will reindex. could take a while.

I don't see any more progress or new output

[25-Mar-19 07:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe peers blocked your node hmm
Try to start daemon with `-addnode=159.69.45.70` (it's my node)

[25-Mar-19 07:19 PM] wookie#7663
ok, 
btw instead of starting with my usual daemon command with my pubkey, I started it with the generic starter command in github:
./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon

[25-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577

You should connect to `38426` not `43060`

[25-Mar-19 07:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Try to delete everything inside ROGUE folder and create such ROGUE.conf file:
```rpcuser=someuser
rpcpassword=somepassword
rpcport=38427
server=1
txindex=1
rpcworkqueue=256
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1```

[25-Mar-19 07:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Just change username and password to some not so easy. And then start daemon again

[25-Mar-19 07:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe you have some network issues or firewall blocking

[25-Mar-19 07:34 PM] wookie#7663
I've been using this same internet (at work) to get to ROGUE since the beginning, I was at home the last 2 days with probably the same issue.

[25-Mar-19 07:40 PM] wookie#7663
the rogue.conf that was in there has the same contents, but I replaced it anyways. restarted daemon, connection still 0

[25-Mar-19 07:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm as only idea I left - try this daemon https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/releases/download/0.1/komodod_fsm_osx_mar26.zip

[25-Mar-19 07:49 PM] wookie#7663
it's just strange that it worked until yesterday. I was able to play 2 short games at home.

[25-Mar-19 07:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's because daemon in bundle is outdated and other nodes dont like it

[25-Mar-19 07:51 PM] TonyL#3577
I've tried to play on daemon from bundle today but not tried to sync from scratch

[25-Mar-19 08:11 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Playing long game and monitoring extract - it seems that fix is working.

i guess it isnt detecting it...

[25-Mar-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Got it only once when moved from 20 to 19

[25-Mar-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
does it hand on extracting?

[25-Mar-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
No level17 - it's my in-game state (both warrior and dungeon levels are 17 at the moment 😃 )

[25-Mar-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
`  "extracted": "$$$gold.9318 hp.105 strength.31/31 level.17 exp.566311 dl.20",` - in extract

[25-Mar-19 08:55 PM] TonyL#3577
I have a plan - will find now first not broadcasted keystroke - will try to broadcast manually all one by one from this point

[25-Mar-19 08:55 PM] TonyL#3577
And maybe this way I'll sync till lvl17

[25-Mar-19 08:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha found "entry point" (it's first keystroke which have zero batontxid in output)

Rebroadcasted it - non zero baton now it output

[25-Mar-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying next 😃

[25-Mar-19 09:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, unfortunately it not changed extract:

It's like a dead I wonder after this "FinalizeCCTx couldn't find 00000..."

[25-Mar-19 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Unfortunately it seems I have only bailout option now

[25-Mar-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
well it seems clear this is one of the last pesky bugs

[25-Mar-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Interesting that after manual rebroadcasting these keystroke transactions mined

[25-Mar-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
But not changed extract

[25-Mar-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
confirmed?

[25-Mar-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeaah, that test back and forth is like a 99.9% reliability confirmation

```extracted $$$gold.9318 -> 1128.72661200 ROGUE hp.105 strength.31/31 level.17 exp.566363 dl.20 n.1 amulet.1``` - 1100 ROGUE is better than nothing anyway lol 😃

[25-Mar-19 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
You said that it should work fine if broadcast in 10-15 seconds after level start. And it found baton on manual rebroadcasting after some time.
So maybe set artificial delay like a 
```if delta between levels change <20 seconds
wait until delta > 20 seconds, then broadcast keystroke
else just broadcast keystroke```

[25-Mar-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried that, it made things really unstable
