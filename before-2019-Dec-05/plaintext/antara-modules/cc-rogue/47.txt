one player is registered. rogue doesnt wait

[19-Feb-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
once a game starts, it is started

[19-Feb-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont register within 60 blocks, registration is closed

[19-Feb-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont play and get past levels so you submit keystrokes tx within 60 blocks, you are dead

[19-Feb-19 12:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I tried and got: `didnt register in time` üôÇ 
üëç

[19-Feb-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Earlier I tried it gave me error that I don't have sufficient balance

[19-Feb-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
buyin of 0.1

[19-Feb-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just want to clear if this showing in my pending games output means it's not just the game created by me, but form anyone over the network

[19-Feb-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
pending are all games in the network

[19-Feb-19 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool! much clear üëç

[19-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible to hijack someone elses single player game

[19-Feb-19 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I probably have done that a day or so ago üòÑ

[19-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but since it didnt cost anything to create, no harm , no foul

[19-Feb-19 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was testing and trying all of them in pending

Added warrior choice on multiplayer game register, beatified more multiplayer games lists prints

[19-Feb-19 12:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Thinking now how to implement these prints with exact amounts:
```"Extracting Gold from the Dungeons of Doom" 
"Converting game gold to ROGUE"
```
Since extracting printing on bailout in stdout

[19-Feb-19 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a 
"Extractid X Gold from the Dungeons of Doom"
"Converting game gold to Y ROGUE"

Or you just wanted to change message about next block waiting to these  without sums @Cryptofist ?

maybe time for bundle release?

[19-Feb-19 12:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Would be great if few more multiplayer games happens - if it there are no any dramatical mistakes/crashes I'll build fresh portable release for Ubuntu and MacOS

[19-Feb-19 12:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Or we can test in portable hmm - it's quite fast to build new one if needed. Bundling

sorry, just fixed a validation error

[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
probably best to make sure basic gameplay still works and make another release, FSM and jl777 are in sync

[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I've not bundled komodod anyway yet

[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
It's just TUI so far

[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
good. i dont expect more validation changes today

[19-Feb-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
what was confusing me was the tx were still onchain even though error. then i realized likely the miners are not updated yet

[19-Feb-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
also if you just play in a different console than you run the komodod, the printouts wont affect gameplay

[19-Feb-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i really need to be having printouts during the debugging

[19-Feb-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
latest version validates newgame tx and does a validation check and print for bailout/highlander tx

[19-Feb-19 12:55 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@SHossain i am non tech. how can  i run this?? need which program??

I need to make sure we  stage publication of release with these things or it's just dead posts on social.
Such as: contest needs to be posted from Rogue  accounts first , then shared by Komodo for exposure.  I tried to nip that in the bud. But everyone is so excited. ü§£

cd ../..
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```
