@wookie Try to restart daemon with `-reindex` param
Are you using latest 0.4.0rc bundle?

[25-Mar-19 05:29 AM] wookie#7663

[25-Mar-19 05:30 AM] wookie#7663

@TonyL

[25-Mar-19 06:12 AM] wookie#7663
hmm...looks like I broke it 😅  
I just tried manual bailout, and the daemon window output:
illegal game err.-1

[25-Mar-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i reverted the 5 min delay. things were very good before that. I think maybe you can test with making sure you dont go down a level too fast

[25-Mar-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
then the only issue would be traps

[25-Mar-19 07:39 AM] ronyi#5719
If warrior is escaped in the dungon then disappear? Or possible to use in another game?

[25-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be usable

[25-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is untested as nobody escaped with amulet until recently

[25-Mar-19 07:44 AM] ronyi#5719
TonyL and Me escaped just not according to the blockchain. 😄 and thanks for the quick response

[25-Mar-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the 0000... keystrokes tx, seems to be caused by too fast changing levels

[25-Mar-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
once you see that, then that is where the game is stopped

[25-Mar-19 07:46 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay a creating video again and trying slowly changing levels.

[25-Mar-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is likely when it happens within 5 seconds to 10 seconds

@wookie Hmm it looks like you're using some legacy warrior with this ```1: 10  q* s dsjdsjq* a hhhkhhhhhhhhhhhhh h hhhhhkkkhhhh s
``` inventory bug
Or maybe it's a new bug. What happened is - keystrokes recorded to the "favourite fruit name" in game options

Was this warrior created long time ago?

It's a closest attempt so far 😃

[25-Mar-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll be in plane for next few hours - will play on my side then. Updated daemon with revert and it seems that progress saving quite fine now again

[25-Mar-19 09:31 AM] ronyi#5719

the blockchain paid 914 ROGUE for it

[25-Mar-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
what happend on level5 on the way up?

[25-Mar-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but this shows the earning power of "immortal" playerdata

[25-Mar-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
they can convert 90 minutes of time to a lot of ROGUE

[25-Mar-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so i wonder what its economic value is. certainly a lot more than 1000 ROGUE. likely nobody but ronyi is able to pay its actual value

[25-Mar-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
something that can earn 1000 ROGUE per day would likely be work 100,000 ROGUE ?

[25-Mar-19 10:00 AM] ronyi#5719
I don't see anything extraordinary. My video is playable right now.

[25-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Mylo#8306
How much ROGUE is 7000 gold?
Nice video @ronyi

[25-Mar-19 10:07 AM] ronyi#5719
Thanks, 7000 * 7000 * dungeon level * 10, if i know right.

[25-Mar-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
with amulet the dungeon level is 26

[25-Mar-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
also winning gets you a bigger multiplier

[25-Mar-19 10:56 AM] jorian#4555
did anyone ever win already?

[25-Mar-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes a few times, just havent gotten the blockchain proof for it yet

[25-Mar-19 12:18 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL yes, this warrior was created probably 1-2 weeks ago. He's been around and may have "died" at least once from hypothermia that I can remember, but was (luckily) still on list of warriors afterwards.

@wookie I'm not sure - we had CC Eval 0x11 Invalid prints when chain not synced on OSX. But this issue should be resolved. It's quite strange - I'm playing with started daemon from 0.4.0 bundle and can't see it on my side. 
So is problem on your side at the moment only the game in which you can't do bailout or now chain not syncing because of these prints?

[25-Mar-19 04:10 PM] wookie#7663
ok, i'm going to try reindexing again

[25-Mar-19 04:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Is chain syncing now on your side?

[25-Mar-19 04:15 PM] wookie#7663
yes, its syncing

[25-Mar-19 04:25 PM] wookie#7663
I'm still getting the error at the end of reindexing, looks like the same thing but different text:

I'm going to delete blockchain and resync whole blockchain again

[25-Mar-19 04:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe these prints on reindex are fine since it's succesfully synced

[25-Mar-19 04:31 PM] wookie#7663
I was still able to play a couple of short games that bailed out ok, and rogues showed up on blockchain despite those error messages. haven't tried a long game since.

[25-Mar-19 04:31 PM] wookie#7663
maybe it's fine...

[25-Mar-19 04:34 PM] TonyL#3577
It looks like some warrior/warriors not-compatible with current version. I think with new ones it should be fine

[25-Mar-19 04:34 PM] TonyL#3577
I can transfer you Leeroy Jenkins if you wish 😃

[25-Mar-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
does multiplayer work? looking at the code it looks like the winner wont be able to make a highlander tx

[25-Mar-19 04:58 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL thanks. I'll just buildup another new warrior. 
after redownloading the blockchain, I immediately tried manual bailout of that last game, and again I got:
 illegal game err.-1

I next launched tui, and tried to start a game, but it gave me the error:
Something went wrong.
'txid'
Press [Enter] to continue...

I stopped the daemon and restarted it. Once again, in tui, when I try to start a new game, I get:
Something went wrong.
'txid'
Press [Enter] to continue...

seems I can't start a new game anymore😢

[25-Mar-19 05:00 PM] TonyL#3577

``` When switched from lvl26 to lvl27 (and on lvl26 played few minutes)

[25-Mar-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
What is the most interesting - I've monitored extract print whole game
When I reached lvl26: I had this print in `extracted`
```  "extracted": "$$$gold.6842 hp.105 strength.29/29 level.17 exp.449956 dl.26",

[25-Mar-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
So it like a flushed one keystroke for dl26 ( lvl in extract rolled  back from dl26 to dl25)

[25-Mar-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 builds now, that went a lot faster than I estimated

[25-Mar-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i will add error checking to keystrokes

[25-Mar-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Will it try to rebroadcast it until success in such case or progress just should stop in case of error?

[25-Mar-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it will pretend as if it didnt happen and the next time will issue a full keystrokes

It's not a problem - error there is expected

[25-Mar-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
It's bailout attempt for game for which bailout was already executed and mined

[25-Mar-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, `CC signing error: vini.0 has unknown CC address` this print confused me a little when it was initially reported

[25-Mar-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it probably skipped getting everything setup since it was already bailed out

[25-Mar-19 06:23 PM] TonyL#3577
But not confused not less because it's a game for which wookie getting such error:

this was the output from the daemon screen:
extracted $$$gold.4858 -> 42.48029520 ROGUE hp.69 strength.19/20 level.11 exp.5800 dl.18 n.1 amulet.0
CC signing error: vini.0 has unknown CC address.(RAMvUfoyURBRxAdVeTMHxn3giJZCFWeha2)```
And then this:
```I got this on daemon output:

unexpected null pwallet in RelayWalletTransaction
that means likely DB is corrupted

I've advised `-reindex` firstly, maybe wallet.dat should be refreshed

[25-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, seems some hard reset happened
