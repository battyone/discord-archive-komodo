here you go: 
If ROGUE already running,use this command  `komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE addnode 116.203.120.163 add`
If launching ROGUE add this launch parameter `-addnode=116.203.120.163`

let us put a fork in the rogue chain, so to speak. it will be rebooted. just too many versions out there using different rules

[10-Apr-19 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm thinking now if it fine to trasnfer old warriors: as I understand  in cases when people played/playing on different komodod versions and different forks  - some warriors can start do bad things on the fresh chain as well (I think thats how forks initially happened actually)

[10-Apr-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe it's worth to transfer only coins and start from "clean sheet" for warriors avatars

[10-Apr-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be easiest

Hi,

I'm one of the many candidates running for election for KMD NN operator in the `EU region`.

I could really use your support and votes.

My proposal `(node-9)` can be found here: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/node-9`

Please send votes to me at this address,  `RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW`

and to other candidates who support the KMD ecosystem, and need votes, at the addresses that they post.

Thanks,

I tried manual bailout but I keep getting this error, and the chain gets stopped. I have to restart the daemon.

@wookie Hi! Chain will be restarted next week from scratch and existing balances airdropped (probably in #kmdlabs cluster, it depends of @Alright and @blackjok3r decision)

[14-Apr-19 06:21 AM] Alright#0419
we can do it on CFEK cluster, is that fine @TonyL ?

[14-Apr-19 06:21 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't necessarily have to be a "CFEK" chain

[14-Apr-19 06:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, thats totally fine I think since notas should prevent forks

[14-Apr-19 06:22 AM] TonyL#3577
We can start everything with latest FSM nodes and I'll prepare latest FSM bundles and delete all old ones

[14-Apr-19 06:23 AM] Alright#0419
you'll need LABS komodod or notarizations won't be recognized

[14-Apr-19 06:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, right! I wonder all rogue code (FSM branch) in sync with kmdlabs daemon

Not sure if there are plans for chain which combining all cc based games

[14-Apr-19 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
In general more chains is better I think because it's taking less storage space and you have to download only specific game blocks if you need only this one

[14-Apr-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
But it depends on the scale of the game probably

[14-Apr-19 07:51 AM] ronyi#5719
I think maybe better for all games project is running on 1 chains (Tetris, Rogue, Sodoku, komdore64 and .....). The avarage users if want play, download all different chains and start komodod with different parameter, not exactly user friendly.

[14-Apr-19 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577
I think there might be something like a gaming Agama (kinda blockchain Steam) - you choose a game you want to play and it's downloading first (native mode daemon starting and syncing)

[14-Apr-19 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577
To make it user-friendly

[14-Apr-19 07:55 AM] ronyi#5719
Ok for me, just thinked a little bit.

We have a little bit of both actually; a common chain and deferred ones.

[14-Apr-19 07:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@ronyi Komodore64 is not "a game", we are a company and ecosystem developer.

[14-Apr-19 07:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
And 
```The avarage users if want play, download all different chains and start komodod with different parameter, not exactly user friendly.```
is exactly what we are solving.

Other than the upcoming restarting of the chain, are there further plans for ROGUE?

[15-Apr-19 05:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Rogue is a cool thing, were created a lot of new techniques and code so by this opened a lot of oportunnities for other games. I'm not sure if there any further plans for especially ROGUE chain/game (because it's depends not of me), but want to say personal huge thank you for all testers. You all helped massively with your time, efforts and passion, thank you üôè :Komodo:

If/when ROGUE comes to Labs, there are a few areas that might be worth exploring regarding ROGUE development.

[15-Apr-19 08:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Might it be good to focus it back more to it's original core purposes?

[15-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
We need a developer to continue with the validation code in order to do anything useful with it on LABS. The reason we'll be putting it on the CFEK cluster is to avoid forks. Whichever chain the notaries are running is the definitive chain.

[15-Apr-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL @blackjok3r want to do this today?

[15-Apr-19 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm ready to make portable bundles with kmdlabs daemon inside when needed - shouldn't take much time

[15-Apr-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kmdlabs daemon should not be required, unless we change era any time soon.

[15-Apr-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all that was merged to KMD

[15-Apr-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if era changes... or really whole cluster should be wiped

[15-Apr-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and reset to era 0

[15-Apr-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with correct pubkleys... but I was holding off on this until we launch main chain

[15-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
our notary keys are in jl's repo right now?

[15-Apr-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes should be correct.

[15-Apr-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should work for LABS and CFEK

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to double check that thoug... that said we should really reset era to 0 for main chain launch and get new keys

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
CFEKROGUE?

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will work yes... but really we should reset era first

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL you'll do airdrop?

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wipe entire thing

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise you will need to launch it again

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its goint to be a chain that is kept

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
can do it if not, just need a snapshot or chain and height to get it from

[15-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if your just tetin validation

[15-Apr-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then doesnt amtter

[15-Apr-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thsi is why I said not to do it now

[15-Apr-19 10:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright Can do it, yep

[15-Apr-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess you can launch a chain but I realyl dont think you should add any notarizations to until I can reset LABS eras ready for the main chain launch... unless I get some free timr in the next 2 days to get LABS ready for launch, we need pubkeys from everyone though, dont see that taking a day or 2.

[15-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
simply starting it with CFEK* will work for now

[15-Apr-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont care tha all notarisations will become invalid once we launch the main chain yes it will.
