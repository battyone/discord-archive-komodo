When some progress is missing - try to not bailout immediately but wait few more blocks (`n` option to wait one more block). Maybe more/all progress will be saved - noticed it few times

[04-Mar-19 05:15 PM] TonyL#3577
No errors in your keystrokes - so maybe something which not suits extract happened on lvl10

[04-Mar-19 05:15 PM] ronyi#5719
I waited one more block.

[04-Mar-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
I see. Will try to catch non-det bugs tomorrow. Will do specific things on specific level and then check where extraction stopped

[04-Mar-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
You may extract your game and check `rogue.gameseed.10` file - maybe there is something strange in keystrokes

Hi guys, I am a bit better feeling, not 100%... but not out of commission. 
I gotta tie up some other work things today and will be back tomorrow! 
I have some questions in the meantime.

Tony - 1. A couple of news outlets pushed out BTCtalk ANN , so the original windows bundle link you posted is there (they copied/pasted) Can make that a still useful link somehow?  
2. Can you also leave me a list of things to test if need be for tue/wed?  Should I try to pull 1-2 more people in here? Seems we lost some people.

jl777 -1. What is an estimated time frame for when you think we will know if this is or is not a test chain ?  My assumption is that it isn't going to end up just a test chain, but we wont know til you feel it is complete.  I'm looking for some info to help complete the timeline i'm making. 
2.  How do we feel about taking Rogue out to a video game convention in mid-april?  Do think it is possible  to have a version  to run in a booth to demo at that point? There is the East Coast Game Con in NC at that time, not too far from me and sensibly priced booths.  If not there are many more later. 
3. Is there  any documentation on how RogueCC itself works I can take a look at? 

Thanks guys!

[04-Mar-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
current ROGUE chain will either morph into the real chain, or at worst we will airdrop the ROGUE balances from this chain to the real one

I have been "waiting for next block before bailout" for quite a while, I keep getting this message every few minutes that I have never seen this before: 
Do you want to make bailout now [y] or wait for one more block [n]? [y/n]: 

what's the difference between bailing out now or waiting for one more block?

[05-Mar-19 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
check to see if the gold it extracts matches the gameplay. if it does, no need to wait for next block

[05-Mar-19 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if things dont change after several blocks, likely it wont be changing, so no point waiting

[05-Mar-19 12:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the point to wait is that sometimes it will extract more gold by getting more keystrokes tx confirmed

[05-Mar-19 12:17 AM] wookie#7663
now that you mentioned it, I just scrolled back to look. The gold was short by about 30% (I ended the game with almost 6000, but only 4000 was recorded). I waited through 4 of those messages and then I said yes.

[05-Mar-19 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
still a few cases where the keystrokes seem to be getting lost. once we track that down things will become a lot more reliable

@TonyL @ronyi finally tracked down the crash. it was a bug in the rogue code where if a nymph steals an item that you have more than one of, it ended up discarding the object, even if it is still in your pack. so things ended up with freed memory in the pack and that led to random crashes or not depending on OS, mem situation, etc
