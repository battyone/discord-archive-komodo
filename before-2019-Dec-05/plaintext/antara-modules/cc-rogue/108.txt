In this one warrior don't have anything suspicious in invetory:
```      "pack": [
          "Some food",
          "8 slime-molds",
          "+7 leather armor [protection 9]",
          "A +8,+5 two handed sword",
          "5 scrolls of teleportation",
          "7 potions of restore strength(violet)",
          "5 potions of extra healing(ecru)",
          "4 potions of healing(cyan)",
          "A potion of monster detection(purple)",
          "A potion of confusion(gold)",
          "A ring of sustain strength(granite)",
          "A ring of slow digestion(zircon)",
          "A ring of slow digestion(zircon)",
          "A ring of searching(jade)",
          "A ring of see invisible(onyx)",
          "A ring of dexterity [-1](opal)"
        ],
```

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
in the error printout where the two inventories are listed out, one is what it generated, the other is what is claimed

[26-Mar-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
which inventory got confirmed? the valid one or the invalid one

[26-Mar-19 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
After two inventories prints there is a print:
`2a34b36cc1292aecfaabdad79b42cab9989fa6dcc87ac8ca88aa6162dab1e2c4 playerdata: gold.4377 hp.91 strength.31/31 level.13 exp.29824 dl.15
`

[26-Mar-19 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Which reflecting upper one

[26-Mar-19 12:11 PM] TonyL#3577
And 2a34b36cc1292aecfaabdad79b42cab9989fa6dcc87ac8ca88aa6162dab1e2c4 is on mainchain

[26-Mar-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
There are prints with inventories on earlier heights as well - so I think maybe not it is the clue

[26-Mar-19 12:13 PM] TonyL#3577
And if first inventory is valid one - it seems that it was choosen correct

All these transactions in last prints before stuck are blocks generating I wonder

ok, so there is no invalid tx on chain, your node just got connected to peers that are banned by other nodes

use -connect to a known good node

[26-Mar-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, after ~40 minutes I'm synced

[26-Mar-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Was in stuck for 20-30 minutes I wonder

[26-Mar-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577

Have connection only to node with full chain

[26-Mar-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe latest version is broken and not validating a valid playerdata?

On not healthy node I'm staying there and sycned from scratch from healthy node - thats strange

[26-Mar-19 12:51 PM] TonyL#3577
They have same daemon

[26-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh but healthy node no need to check previous txs - I bet if I'll try to reindex healthy node will stuck on 69521 too

[26-Mar-19 12:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw maybe make favourite fruit name const? In some very edge cases keystrokes writing to options fileds Name and Fruit Name (options calling by `?`). Not sure if then rogue can understand that something calling non slim-mold is slim-mold

[26-Mar-19 01:02 PM] ronyi#5719
Oh yes, 69521 i played this warrior and after i write this:

[26-Mar-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the big question is how the mainchain accepted that tx\

[26-Mar-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe latest daemon added error checking after that happened?

[26-Mar-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if so ,we should resync to that height

[26-Mar-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and make that the mainchain

[26-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I wonder just some checks were added in latest updates

[26-Mar-19 01:07 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's just an assumption

[26-Mar-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
latest is refusing to accept a bad tx that is on mainchan

[26-Mar-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking it is getting close to time to reboot the chain

[26-Mar-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we can airdrop new coins to existing holders

[26-Mar-19 01:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, we're close to stable gameplay atm :). Also perc can be adjusted in reboot (if it needed - I wonder it's too high now. Oh but maybe not with recent rewards enlargement)

[26-Mar-19 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe make snapshot on 77777 ?

[26-Mar-19 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
It looks symbolic 😃

[26-Mar-19 01:21 PM] ronyi#5719
do we lose the warriors?

[26-Mar-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
we might be able to transport warriors to the new chain

[26-Mar-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
get the playerdata for all the players you want and we can allow them to be ressurected on the new chain

[26-Mar-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Will be first NFT crosschain swap migration in history I wonder

[26-Mar-19 01:28 PM] TonyL#3577
So for now as I understand only way to sync node with latest chain and pass trough validations is bootstrap blockchain from healthy node and download bootstrap from fresh node

I need the opreturn hex for each of those

[26-Mar-19 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
```"scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "OP_RETURN f26321..."``` this one? 

I can make script to save this hex for warrior/warriors list so players will be able to save their warriors

[26-Mar-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the hex

[26-Mar-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the playerdata in the opreturn

[26-Mar-19 02:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so `"hex"` field from `scriptPubKey`

[26-Mar-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so in the new chain we recreate it and transfer it to the pubkey, along with allowing such creating players out of thin air

[26-Mar-19 02:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, will share the script asap

{Reactions}
awthanks 

[26-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
```#!/usr/bin/env python3

from lib import tuilib

rpc_connection = tuilib.def_credentials("ROGUE")

players_list = rpc_connection.cclib("players", "17")["playerdata"]

for player in players_list:
    player_vouts = rpc_connection.getrawtransaction(player, 1)["vout"]
    for vout in player_vouts:
        if vout["value"] == 0:
            print(vout["scriptPubKey"]["hex"])
```

[26-Mar-19 02:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Should print hexes of opreturn vout for whole playerlist (have to be executed from folder which contains lib folder of TUI). You can just forward output from script to file if needed:
`python3 script.py >> file.txt`

Interesting that he have such short hex now - I think it's because I placed him in token order and cancelled order then

[26-Mar-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be the opreturn from tokenid

[26-Mar-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so it cant be short

Yes, it's not possible to pass trough 69521 at the moment with a fresh sync. I wonder that soon there will be chain reset with balances airdrop

[26-Mar-19 03:33 PM] wookie#7663

It worked! I was able to get sync'd and launch tui. It listed a previous warrior I had from a few days ago, but when I tried to reuse it, it gave me an error. I was able to start a new warrior. Gonna try it out now.

I just played a short game and died on level2, however it's been stuck trying to bailout:

That means that bailout not returned `txid`

[26-Mar-19 04:25 PM] TonyL#3577
You can try to do it manually too see what it returning

[26-Mar-19 04:25 PM] wookie#7663
I don't have a gametxid

[26-Mar-19 04:26 PM] wookie#7663
this was the txid when the game started, can I use that?

[26-Mar-19 04:26 PM] wookie#7663
txid: 6d901f85dad29f285cac763d1dd136040941b74745e5e746b0a5810fd90f7df1

[26-Mar-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
It printing in the beggining something like a:
new game created. gametxid: txid here
waiting for game txid to be mined

[26-Mar-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
It's even before warrior choice

[26-Mar-19 04:34 PM] wookie#7663
ok, got it

Maybe it's because daemon in bundle is old - try to use this one: https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/releases/download/0.1/komodod_fsm_osx_mar26.zip

Maybe network not accepting your keystrokes now. Try to play game where your warrior is not dead to see if it make difference

[26-Mar-19 06:21 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL everything works now, played a game to lvl8 and quit, gold->ROGUE-> blockchain. I was able to use a warrior from a couple of days ago too.

[26-Mar-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
I added a field to gameinfo "buyins" that should be the total buyins for the game
