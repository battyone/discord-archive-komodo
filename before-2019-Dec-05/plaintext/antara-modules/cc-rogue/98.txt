Lool, you're doing same things which i did in my game where I lost progress

[19-Mar-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
1) You used enchancement armor scroll
2) You found identify scroll scroll and used it on echancement armor scroll
3) You used enchanacement armor scroll again

[19-Mar-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Somewhere after this point progress is missing/corrupted

[19-Mar-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
I bet that if you'll try to play without scrolls usage - progress will be fully saved

[19-Mar-19 11:36 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay playing ubuntu without scroll usage it will be difficult ðŸ˜„

[19-Mar-19 11:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes hands want to do it automatically ðŸ˜ƒ

[19-Mar-19 11:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Armor enchance scroll is my 100% favourite now in this non-det hunt

[19-Mar-19 11:38 AM] TonyL#3577
On second place some combination of identify scroll scroll and identified scroll usage

Where my game stopped - I've picked up many items and iventory was full too on some point

[19-Mar-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
So if you've not used scrolls - it seems we excluded it as well from reasons

[19-Mar-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Inventory overfill  is next guess I wonder  ðŸ˜ƒ

[19-Mar-19 12:14 PM] ronyi#5719
How to pick up more items?

[19-Mar-19 12:16 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure - hmm you have 45 items in inventory on screenshot, but print showing 46 vs total 47 and you have 19 letters but print showing 21 inventory letters

[19-Mar-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe just print is not correct ðŸ¤”

[19-Mar-19 12:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Inventory counters may cause corruption as well I wonder (especially if something couting not correct / not as expected)
`i will just scrub every last static variable that isnt const` - so maybe it will help in case if it is the clue

[19-Mar-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
made half a dozen changes, none of which I can see how it explains the issues, but then again this bug is not an obvious one

[19-Mar-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe things works exactly the same, or it is totally broken, but likely something in between. just test in unix

`Information about game saved on chain: $$$gold.476 hp.55 strength.25/25 level.9 exp.1765 dl.4` you never had 476 gold - strange why this extracted

I'd like to clarify something: if a icemonster kills my warrior by hypothermia, my warrior should just be dead/gone, correct?

[19-Mar-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems there is an issue with icemonsters. you freeze and seem dead, but thaw out and can be used again

[19-Mar-19 05:59 PM] wookie#7663
OK, I just finished a game where I was killed by hypothermia by the Icemonster, but on bailout, no only did it keep me alive, it gave me more gold than what I had when I died

[20-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
until we isolate the non-det, all extra info helps. if you can play without scrolls (or without rings or without potions) and things are stable, then we at least can narrow it down to the type of magic that causes the non-det

what magic did you use

[20-Mar-19 08:40 AM] ronyi#5719
2 slow digestion ring and warrior exp was 181 dropped some potions, but in this game i used only rings.

[20-Mar-19 08:45 AM] ronyi#5719
Just simple idea, somehow possible printf all variable, const while playing?
4 games playing(dlvl 1-3) without ring everything is good.
1 game wtih 2 slow digestion ring and everything is good.

[20-Mar-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there are too many variables 100+

[20-Mar-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it could be the ring

[20-Mar-19 08:56 AM] ronyi#5719
I playing more without rings, but yes.

[20-Mar-19 09:35 AM] ronyi#5719
Intresting game i started this game with full strenght and 2 rings missing. Game extracted fine, but some thing is not good in strenght (inventory, items) calculation. Somehow possible pickup more items i think.

[20-Mar-19 10:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you try to play with fresh warrior / re-use him and never fill inventory fully? (just drop not needed item before pickup to keep items amount ~const)

[20-Mar-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Now it looks like inventory is a thing which working a little bit not as expected. And with fresh warriors progress extracting fine almost 100% cases I think no matters of gameplahy

[20-Mar-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
So I'm thinking that it's like this maybe because inventory never reaching edge states for games with fresh ones

[20-Mar-19 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Unpacking / stacking + items packs + strength formula with non-constant strength + rings which can protect it

[20-Mar-19 10:05 AM] TonyL#3577
For me it seems as trickiest stuff in whole game, and rogue code for it (interaction with inventory) is super tricky as well

[20-Mar-19 10:06 AM] TonyL#3577
+ you're loosing some items when you shouldn't

[20-Mar-19 10:07 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, with fresh warriors no problem. How to know my inventory is full or not? Yes strenght*2, but if possible pick up more items and sometimes calculate good and sometimes not and sometimes i have 48item, but my inventory size is 54 and can't pick up items. I testing my lvl9 warriors without rings.

[20-Mar-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
I've analyzed some videos tonight - and have an idea now that progress might be lost after some item pickup / drop with inventory edge case

[20-Mar-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to play re-usage game without much items pickup let's say and compare stability

[20-Mar-19 10:08 AM] ronyi#5719
Sounds good.

[20-Mar-19 10:09 AM] ronyi#5719
Maybe good test. Using rings, but inventory never full?

[20-Mar-19 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, play as usual but try to keep amount of items in inventory low

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘Œ 

[20-Mar-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
And maybe it's better to create fresh warrior for this test which never had huge inventory in his adventures (let's say maybe current warriors inventory already corrupted / causing corruption because of huge size)

[20-Mar-19 10:12 AM] ronyi#5719
If i create new warrior and using gain strenght potion = huge inventory = inventory corruption?

[20-Mar-19 10:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe gained strength working not correctly because of something hardcoded in original rogue code, or maybe when invetory is full some counter working not correct

[20-Mar-19 10:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Just think that it's a hugest bottleneck because of amonut of code

[20-Mar-19 10:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Playing without changing original max strength is a good test as well, also maybe might be a good idea temporary disable `strength*2` max inventory rule and return this logic to the original one to see if it helps

[20-Mar-19 10:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Problems after strength gaining looks probably - I think on place where I lost progress yesterday I've quaffed strength restore + strength gain potions also besides of the scrolls usage

[20-Mar-19 11:09 AM] ronyi#5719
I played a game(dlvl 8) now and my inventory was never full. Everything worked good.
