What day did you start the chain JL?

[15-Feb-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
18500 blocks ago

[15-Feb-19 03:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504

"see hobgoblin, Looks at gold collected. presses Q to bail" ü§£

[15-Feb-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
I mined about 7000 ROGUE before releasing the chain params

[15-Feb-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
since then I mined less than 1000 ROGUE, so someone else is mined 10,000 or so ROGUE

[15-Feb-19 03:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Genie !! Usual suspect lols

[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
as chain activity goes up, this will be diluted down 10x, 100x, etc

[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no cap to coin supply

[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
each time 10 ROGUE is transacted, 1 ROGUE appears out of thin air

[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not your ordinary chain

[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the normal concerns dont much apply

[15-Feb-19 03:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
What's the consensus Algo?

Farming gold even by getting to level 2 etc and bailing is a slow process. I have nearly 1 rogue from many games lol these will be rare

[15-Feb-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
once there is a decent market for playerdata, I think that will easily absorb whatever cheap ROGUE that miners will dump close to mining cost

[15-Feb-19 03:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
A nice flashy GUI with different looking avatars and weapons etc will bring that to reality i believe

[15-Feb-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
having a graphical player DEX is fully compatible with the ascii gameplay, so for people that only do the collectibles side of things, it can be a fully graphical experience

[15-Feb-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the ascii mode would just be for the gold farmers and multiplayer warriors

I downloaded the game above from the iOS store.

[15-Feb-19 04:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Pixel dungeon.

[15-Feb-19 04:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Check it out. Let me know if you guys think it's a cool interface.

[15-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@jl777c correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't Pixel Dungeon require a new chain since it's vastly different from Rogue? 

But we could use the graphics and make a *similar* GUI

[15-Feb-19 05:00 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll have to add what's possible and not possible to the ANN. There's a lot of excitement around all of this.

once you bailout a game, you cant go in it again?

[15-Feb-19 05:44 PM] Pumtchak#0362
@siu - Chainmakers yes you have to start a new game

[15-Feb-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
what does bailout mean?

[15-Feb-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
definition #1: the act of parachuting from an aircraft, especially to escape a crash, fire, etc

[15-Feb-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so no more airplane after you bailout

what was the seed for both of you?

[15-Feb-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
odds of same room is remote, unless seed is the same

[15-Feb-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
aha, you started at the same block, so the seed would be the same!

[15-Feb-19 06:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
crazy i thought the chances were high aswell

[15-Feb-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the seed is based on blockhash

[15-Feb-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so same block means same seed

wait until the deeper levels. their monster stats scare me, just by looking at them

{ "jabberwock",   70,    0,    { XX,3000, 15,   6, ___, "2x12/2x4" } },
though a troll is pretty bad too:
