@jl777c by some reason replay interrupting on lvl7 while I've quited on lvl8

[18-Feb-19 08:27 AM] TonyL#3577
And it's interrupting exactly on moment where I quaff potion in hard fight

[18-Feb-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
seems the last keystrokes tx wasnt added in?

[18-Feb-19 08:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Last tx from keystrokes.log is on blockchain and no errors

[18-Feb-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try to play with potions quaff 😃

[18-Feb-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Potions of restore HP and increase Str - I think there is something around it

[18-Feb-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes could be

[18-Feb-19 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Will do simple test now: quaff, screenshot this moment, play a little and see replay then

[18-Feb-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
replay exits now

[18-Feb-19 08:35 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c There is a bug with strength
warrior restored with maxstrength 8, but it had maxstrength 17 and just current strength 8

[18-Feb-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
well if current strength was 8, that is what is used

[18-Feb-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to inherit the player attributes

[18-Feb-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you complained if it was set to maxstrength, it didnt match the player strength

[18-Feb-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so i changed it

[18-Feb-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise, you can bailout to do a restore strength

[18-Feb-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
how did you lose 10 strength points?

[18-Feb-19 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
I meant a little bit different
There are max strength and current strength
Before if you left dungeon you every time start new game with 16 from maxstrength strength

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I can set maxstrength to a min of 16

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
I just asked to do start new game with `previous game strength from maxstrength`

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure it is good to do an effective restore strength to full via bailout

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Max strength possible to increase by potions and also strength is possible to restore by potions

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
No need to restore

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Just need to transfer state

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will add that

[18-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a same with HP

[18-Feb-19 08:39 AM] TonyL#3577
HP transferring with current hp and max hp

[18-Feb-19 08:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So I can restore hp to max hp

[18-Feb-19 08:39 AM] TonyL#3577
But now I can't restore my strength to previous max strength because I'm limited by 8

[18-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm sorry if explained bad before

[18-Feb-19 08:42 AM] TonyL#3577

I screenshoted this moment while played

[18-Feb-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Replay interrupting but actually I've played a little bit more and died because of Ice monster

[18-Feb-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, the change strength function was one that gave me a strange error. preserve the game where you can reproduce this

[18-Feb-19 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Yahoo doomguy not died because of this bug

[18-Feb-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
for now i changed the cursesd to fprintf all messages. so if you do an extract it should show all the things it thinks happened. would be interesting to see if it just stops at the potion or keeps going to icemonster

[18-Feb-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577

It's ending on battle with bat - quaff even not captured

[18-Feb-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so the replay is definitely broken... was the bat right before the quaff?

reproduced. pretty spooky it is so easy to replay your game

[18-Feb-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so 'q' 'k' and it stopped?

[18-Feb-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
I played fine after

[18-Feb-19 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Until was killed by icemonster one level later

[18-Feb-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it stops for me right after you get to level2

[18-Feb-19 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
My yesterdays long games progress with Leeroy wasn't saved because of same reason

[18-Feb-19 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Now picture is clear in head 😃

[18-Feb-19 09:03 AM] TonyL#3577
I quaffed yesterday in game with Leeroy on lvl1 gain strength so thats why had replay till lvl1 when quited ond lvl15

[18-Feb-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
gain strength, prevent afterlife for playerdata

[18-Feb-19 09:03 AM] TonyL#3577
```it stops for me right after you get to level2```
Same for me - but actually I've died on level3 or even level4

[18-Feb-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, investigating. this will take a while. better to test new area like multiplayer

It should stop on this frame - I've screenshoted when quaffed

[18-Feb-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see the bulging muscles print

[18-Feb-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577

[18-Feb-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
I made it while played

[18-Feb-19 09:05 AM] TonyL#3577
To easy check if quaffing causing progress not saving

[18-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i know, now I have a 100% reproduced non-determinism bug!

[18-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i wonder if other potions (healing) have the same effect, but first let me track this one down. I might get a clean fix

{Reactions}
🙌 

[18-Feb-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it shows a 'Q' in the replay keystrokes

[18-Feb-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Previous game replay today was interrupted on point where I've quaffed potions of healing - so I wonder healing is causing bug as well. This game can be checked here if needed: ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22f49c62e2c9e2f0c165b2f8e9e6142d949b8c897ccb199e9d030a71490e1b2269%22,%22027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85%22]\"```
 but do not distract you from the current one 😃

[18-Feb-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I pressed `Q n` yup

[18-Feb-19 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Sometimes forgetting that `q`  is for quaff and print `Q`

so any game you did a 'Q' n will abort at that point

[18-Feb-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
just triggered by 'q' thirst for potions

[18-Feb-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810

testing

[18-Feb-19 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah yeah, pressed `Q+n` in both games - in one just missclicked, in second thought to quit first but then decided to use healing potions and continue the fight 😃

[18-Feb-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed test for fix

[18-Feb-19 09:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Even didn't even have such idea that Q may cause it and didn't give attention to Q presses

[18-Feb-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it gets to icemonster

[18-Feb-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
you can replay other strange results games

[18-Feb-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
also ^c might cause problems

Real problems I have when apparently switch keyboard layout from English to Russian

[18-Feb-19 09:41 AM] TonyL#3577

@TonyL - if you have a Mac available for a quick build beside your testings plz use https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/tree/rogue_multiOS - just run ./zcutil/build-mac.sh and let me know result.

[18-Feb-19 09:45 AM] ca333#0118
no

[18-Feb-19 09:45 AM] ca333#0118
its a automated build. Rogue now has its own Makefile: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/rogue_multiOS/src/cc/Makefile_rogue and makerogue is being called in build-mac.sh
