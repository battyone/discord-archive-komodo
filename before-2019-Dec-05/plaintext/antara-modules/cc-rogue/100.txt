Reproduced focus losing - it's happening after you checking inventory after `there is no room in your pack + you moved on %itemname%` print

[20-Mar-19 08:19 PM] TonyL#3577
To easily reproduce - you can just throw and pickup arrows until it fill inventory letters max amount

[20-Mar-19 08:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me check if I can put as many keystrokes as I want in this state

[20-Mar-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so focus losing is the symptom or the cause

[20-Mar-19 08:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Focus losing allows me to press buttons withiout any affection on game process but they are recording as keystrokes

[20-Mar-19 08:20 PM] TonyL#3577
So playing during the replay

[20-Mar-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess if keystrokes dont work without focus, but they go in keystrokes file that would cause non-det

[20-Mar-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, we say the same

[20-Mar-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
focus losing is the cause

[20-Mar-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and it only happens when out of inventory ?

[20-Mar-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup - one arrow press with lost focus and futher progress lost

[20-Mar-19 08:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm so far I found only this way to lose it

[20-Mar-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
what causes it to lose focus at the ncurses level?

[20-Mar-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
can you have decker track this down?

[20-Mar-19 08:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I'll consult with Decker
Flow is:
```There's no room in your pack--More--```
Pressing space - then can do anything - move or fight no matters

[20-Mar-19 08:24 PM] TonyL#3577
On next inventory check I'll need to press Space twice to return control (or press ESC)

Case seems like an edge one - but actually any game with full invetory is ggwp now if you don't know about this bug mechanics 😃

[20-Mar-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Checking now if it actual for Ubuntu only or other platfroms as well

[20-Mar-19 08:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Actual on Windows as well

@ronyi So for now just press double space all the time after inventory checking and you shouldn't loss progress

👌 

[21-Mar-19 08:59 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes this caused fault on my side sometimes i pressed one space and sometimes two, thanks.

[21-Mar-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
With not full inventory it should work with single space - but maybe there are some other cases in different context menus when focus losing.  Please report if you notice any case besides of full inventory when double press needed to return the focus

Thats great news

[21-Mar-19 09:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Two weeks of searches and clue is in one button press...

[21-Mar-19 09:53 AM] ronyi#5719
Rogue is a trollking 😄

[21-Mar-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so we can verify this if the player is very careful to restore focus whenever it is lost?

[21-Mar-19 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
I think - yes

[21-Mar-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to play more games with double space press after inventory closing to be mega sure

[21-Mar-19 10:17 AM] ronyi#5719
me too i think yes.

[21-Mar-19 10:48 AM] ronyi#5719
If i not forget pressing space twice, everything is good. 😄 i used unidentify potions,scrolls, rings and used identifyed potions, scrolls in one game and extracted fine.

[21-Mar-19 03:42 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL I've used the latest MacOS bundle for numerous games over the last few days now. Here's the first time I've ran into an issue. I played to level 16, using both ring of slow digestion + ring of sustain strenthg, but on bailout, it only recorded keystrokes up to level 6. I kept delaying bailout for up to 10x but it was still stuck. I then tried manual bailout.

[21-Mar-19 03:43 PM] TonyL#3577
@wookie `  "error": "couldnt finalize CCtx"` means that bailout tx was mined alredy
I wonder you ran into this inventory focus issue which will be resolved soon I hope

[21-Mar-19 04:05 PM] wookie#7663
"inventory focus issue", do you mean the issue is caused by the "ring of sustain strength"?

[21-Mar-19 04:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope - there is an issue that when quit inventory context menu with full inventory after you step on item - focus is losing until Space is pressed again but in this moment all pressed buttons recording as keystrokes so map movement replaying not correct

[21-Mar-19 04:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm thinking now - what if try to press arrows when inventory is opened

[21-Mar-19 04:38 PM] wookie#7663
I just tried pressing arrow keys while inventory opened. Nothing happened.

[21-Mar-19 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Nothing happened = progress extracted fine?

[21-Mar-19 05:46 PM] wookie#7663
I pressed the arrow keys while inventory was open at the beginning of the game. Then I played to level 14 with both ring of slow digestion and ring of sustain strength. I just exited the game now, and it only recorded keystrokes to level 3:

I'm starting a game now, not gonna use ring of sustain strength to see if the problem is still there. I suspect it's the ring of sustain strength, it's the only "new" item I've used in the past few days.

[21-Mar-19 05:48 PM] ronyi#5719
After checking inventory "quit" with double "space".

[21-Mar-19 05:48 PM] wookie#7663
how do you quit with double space?

[21-Mar-19 05:51 PM] ronyi#5719
If checking inventory the game losing focus, TonyL finded bug and i think Decker is fixing soon. "So for now just press double space all the time after inventory checking and you shouldn't loss progress"

[21-Mar-19 07:25 PM] wookie#7663
out of curiosity, does the game difficulty vary with the number of players playing? Just trying to understand some of the mechanics: if 10 players playing simultaneously mining, vs 1000 players. Would the 1000 players get a more "difficult" game, eg earlier or more trolls/medusas ? just curious. thanks.

[21-Mar-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
no, everything is based on the blockhash -> seed

[21-Mar-19 07:33 PM] wookie#7663
ok, still above my head, but I'm no coder. Is there a difficulty variation then?

[21-Mar-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
