```cd ~/komodo

make clean

rm komodod komodo-cli komodo-tx *.so

cd ../..
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc) ```

@_PureHate_ for Mac it will be:
```cd ~/komodo

./zcutil/build-mac.sh ```

Btw tried to make OSX TUI more compatible by building on older OSX but overkilled a little bit lol. Installed 10.6 OSX - but wasn't able to install deps on it because it's  way too legacy

[24-Feb-19 09:18 PM] TonyL#3577

how to save the game ?

[24-Feb-19 09:18 PM] TonyL#3577
There is no ingame safe - to save your warrior quit the rogue first by `shift + q` then y+enter

[24-Feb-19 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
After it wait for one block and broadcast bailout for gametxid

How long does it take to receive a dex payment for a warrior?  Am checking via  cli getbalance and balance hasn't changed. Rip lvl 9 1600 gold

As soon as order filling transaction is mined you should have more ROGUE

[24-Feb-19 11:27 PM] TonyL#3577
So in most of the cases it's 1 block after trade is made

[24-Feb-19 11:36 PM] joe2x4#5987
hmm not sure it worked then.  Of course I was never able to see the warrior from tui option 14  to verify that was even for sale. I've updated twice since then, and am pretty sure still have same address. That particular warrior did die and produce a tombstone screen so maybe something wacky is/was already happening.

Lets try to trade some

[24-Feb-19 11:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Put your order and I'll fill it

Published testing nightly Ubuntu and OSX ROGUE bundles (daemon + rogue + TUI): 
https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/releases/tag/0.1n

```
ROGUEers who haven't updated daemon yet - you can do it by bundle downloading (it have pre-compiled daemon with latest fixes inside)
On non-updated  version without todays fixes your warriors might not save```

Windows is coming

In next version will update TUI to do these steps automatically, but for now you have to do it to start play. It's steps if you not played ROGUE before on this PC, if you did - you only have to copy .conf file and start daemon from archive with same params as you used before. : 
```
Unzip
Start ROGUE chain, get valid for wallet pubkey, stop the daemon
Copy ROGUE.conf to the folder with unzipped files
Start the daemon with valid pubkey
Wait for chain synchronization```

OK guys. For sale  I have 1 warrior named SpongeBobRoguePants. He's got a long-sword, banded mail, a couple of rings, and plenty of useful scrolls.  He action ready to head to a deep level, all for the bargain price of 1 Rogue coin. Get yours today!

If there was one suggestion  for improvement, it would be to put the inventory list on the screen at all times. Having to check for every action is a royal pain in the butt.

@TonyL I just got the same problem. I exited with approx 1300 gold and got only 0.0001 ROGUE  on bailout. And the warrior was lost... (Called Ultraman).

[25-Feb-19 04:48 AM] Strob#3417
Getting pain in the wrist!

[25-Feb-19 04:54 AM] wookie#7663
@TonyL same here too, got to level 9, still alive, bailed out, but no warrior saved

if the keystrokes tx isnt saved, it is as if you are died

[25-Feb-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are dead, all is gone

[25-Feb-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
now that we improved the player saving, i think it is more due to missing keystrokes files.

[25-Feb-19 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
I added a log of the keystrokes tx being sent to the keystrokes.log, so the GUI can check to make sure it is broadcast properly before doing the bailout

what about the amount of ROGUE? Is that related to keystroke? I just played 2 consecutive games, quit while still alive, each with over 1000+ gold, but I only get 0.0003 ROGUE each
Also, 2 consecutive games now, quit while alive and no warrior saved. @TonyL

0.0003 is the consolation prize on death, means no keystrokes file was sent
