I playing now a long game and testing new TUI.

[25-Feb-19 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI is almost pretty same (just some validations on start added) - daemon in bundle have bug fixes

[25-Feb-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c With fix was able to use this cancelled warrior in a game so issue seems to be resolved

[25-Feb-19 02:43 PM] ronyi#5719
@Cryptofist In this game we are always in danger, you have to pay attention, especially on a small level. If I create a new game with new warrior I starting slowly and farming (rings, potions, scrolls and food! High level warriors is always hungry) upgrade weapon and armor (Lvl.1-3). If my warrior level= 4-5 I starting to use auto-attack and continuously farming on lvl 1-6 and upgrading my equipments. My faviorits item in high warrior level(6-10) slow digestion ring and searching ring and continuously farming on lvl 1-12. After I trying to reaching lvl 21, but after lvl 13 anything can happen (someting hit you and dead). Not easy to find good equipments. Map scroll is very usefull in the maze. I have now lvl 9 warrior and and I haven't found slow digestion ring, searching ring yet. I never find amulet, but trying.

@jl777c Hmm my warriors scanner deciding if warrior dead or alive by:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE gettxout playertxid 1
If output is none I count warrior as dead

I bought this one ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib playerinfo 17 \"[%2277549e285d63e408f98448da0b55ac2285a1913f8cda4510a54746b003ba7d8e%22]\"```- he looks very alive (persists in my players list and I can choose him to start the game)

But `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE gettxout 77549e285d63e408f98448da0b55ac2285a1913f8cda4510a54746b003ba7d8e 1` return nothing 

Is it might be connected to trading that this output is spent?

[25-Feb-19 04:20 PM] TonyL#3577
As comparison for other warrior in my players list:

[25-Feb-19 04:22 PM] TonyL#3577
I've filled order

[25-Feb-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
best to check for 1 satoshi output and make sure it is unspent

[25-Feb-19 04:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, will do 👍

[25-Feb-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
bugfixds today relaxed some strict error checks

[25-Feb-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe various status assumptions are not valid anymore

[25-Feb-19 04:23 PM] TonyL#3577
It will be better since if CC vouts structure will change (or already changed) my scanner will be insta broken

[25-Feb-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, always better to adapt to existing than be hardcoded

[25-Feb-19 04:49 PM] ronyi#5719
If quit my warrior with full HP(32 or 50 or ...) and start a new game this warrior HP always 12.

[25-Feb-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but doesnt it retain the max? so after a bit of time it goes back to the max

[25-Feb-19 04:54 PM] ronyi#5719
no. If this warrior(with 12HP) "born" beside "H", very likely to die. No armor no weapon, first hit and dead.

[25-Feb-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
run!

[25-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
🏃

[25-Feb-19 04:55 PM] ronyi#5719
Follow.

[25-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It sucks to spawn next to an H

[25-Feb-19 04:55 PM] ronyi#5719
and no space for dressing

[25-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Need to equip W + w and usually by then one more hit and you die.

[25-Feb-19 04:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I suppose the game normally starts at 12 on a new game, so... I assume there would have to be a whole lot of coding to have the token determine that number when starting ....

[25-Feb-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you should gain a hp every 10 steps or so

[25-Feb-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
run 100 steps and you can have armor

[25-Feb-19 05:25 PM] ronyi#5719
And run another enemy hand.

[25-Feb-19 05:26 PM] ronyi#5719
very rare case, but possible to die

[25-Feb-19 05:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Potions of healing and teleporting stuff helps in case of bad respawn

[25-Feb-19 05:27 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm usually trying to keep potion of healing on bailout especially for such situations

[25-Feb-19 06:45 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Hmm still can't arrange scanner.

[25-Feb-19 06:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Both are alive

[25-Feb-19 06:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Ahh I think I understood - have to check vout for playertxid not tokentxid

[25-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
tokentxid is only unspent until the first usage

[25-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
playertxid is the most recent

[25-Feb-19 06:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Confusion was mostly because I'm scanning tokenlist

[25-Feb-19 06:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Hard to abstract from tokens

[25-Feb-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
tokenid -> gametxid->baton ?

[25-Feb-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
or just find the spenttxid for the token till you get to where it is unspent

[25-Feb-19 06:50 PM] TonyL#3577
tokenid -> playerinfo -> getrawtransaction -> gettxout

[25-Feb-19 06:51 PM] TonyL#3577
I thought about such option

[25-Feb-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
tokenid/vout, find where it is spent using spentindex

[25-Feb-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
iterate until it is either consumed with a register or you find the unspent

[25-Feb-19 07:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks! Will try to add such iterations now.
 Had not correct logic before which assumed that by call `playerinfo 17 tokenid` I get most actual `playertxid`

[25-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess starting with the tokenlist and then tracing each tokenid to the unspent will get the current playertxid, though some of them could well be in DEX ask

[25-Feb-19 07:02 PM] TonyL#3577
For dex I'm just not checking if it "dead"

[25-Feb-19 07:02 PM] TonyL#3577
If it's actually dead it's not possible to buy/sell it on dex since it's burned

[25-Feb-19 07:03 PM] TonyL#3577
So dex scanner worked correct before I wonder (I can buy warrior with different tokenid / playertxid and detect orders for it)

[25-Feb-19 07:04 PM] TonyL#3577
But usual scanner with death check detected before only warriors with same tokentxid/playertxid

[25-Feb-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt playerinfo show both the tokenid and playertxid?

[25-Feb-19 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577
It show, but if I call `playerinfo tokeind` it showing me playertxid which was on warrior creation moment

[25-Feb-19 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577
other words it's always the same

[25-Feb-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i see. what about gameinfo

[25-Feb-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
for the game the token was created from

[25-Feb-19 07:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to find gametxids now

[25-Feb-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the gameinfo interated the tokenid to the latest playertxid

[25-Feb-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
at worst iterating the spentindex will get you to the latest unspent for a tokenid

[25-Feb-19 07:08 PM] TonyL#3577
But I don't have gameinfo for all games on chain - all I have is `tokenlist`

[25-Feb-19 07:08 PM] TonyL#3577
And tokenids

[25-Feb-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
I can print the gametxid for a playerdata if it isnt already there

[25-Feb-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
then tokenid -> gametxid -> playertxid

[25-Feb-19 07:09 PM] TonyL#3577
It would be great yes

[25-Feb-19 07:10 PM] TonyL#3577
I will able to iterate into the games

[25-Feb-19 07:10 PM] TonyL#3577
And find last one

[25-Feb-19 07:10 PM] TonyL#3577
But now there is no gametxid in playerinfo

[25-Feb-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
now there is

[25-Feb-19 07:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks!

[25-Feb-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
all the data is there, i just am not passing it through with all rpc calls

[25-Feb-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810

Oh have idea how to speedup Rogue TUI (SUDOKU-like) - spin node which constantly creating new singleplayer games when such pending games quantity is <100 let's say. And then in TUI on singleplayer game start I'll just detect such games and register player to some pseudo-random one from this list (exactly how in Komodoku).
So player will start game just in a few seconds (should be must-have for mobile platforms and etc.)

@TonyL would cutting block time to 30 seconds make a significance difference?

[25-Feb-19 09:15 PM] TonyL#3577
It will make waiting time 2 times less than now
But in general my TUI just not very clever.
If add such pre-generating of single games + thread which will do bailout sending procedure in background - it's possible to make singleplayer game process without waiting at all

[25-Feb-19 09:16 PM] TonyL#3577
You'll need to wait for bailout to be mined only if want to re-use this warrior in the next game

[25-Feb-19 09:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is it possible to make a new loading screen with the TUI ? @TonyL  Or  would that need to be something separate?

[25-Feb-19 09:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Since TUI using for testing - I'm printing information which allows me to debug/understand picture of problem in case of error on user side

[25-Feb-19 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
can you make new game txs for the user with any pubkey? Then they use it?
