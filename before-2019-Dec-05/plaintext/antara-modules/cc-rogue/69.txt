All good ill keep checking

[26-Feb-19 05:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you sure he is not in your players list?

[26-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Cryptofist#7504
same for me

[26-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ill check again

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I had 5 with a level 2 tonyl

[26-Feb-19 05:16 PM] Cryptofist#7504
still have 5 no tonyl level1

[26-Feb-19 05:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe I have it and the TUI isnt pulling it up?

[26-Feb-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
seems there is refresh issue

[26-Feb-19 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577
When you updated TUI last time? I broke warriors scanner very hard ~1 hour ago

[26-Feb-19 05:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Lemme update again.

[26-Feb-19 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
No need please üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
It's still broken

[26-Feb-19 05:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
oh

[26-Feb-19 05:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
lol

[26-Feb-19 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll rollback it now

[26-Feb-19 05:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Man, after these two things with refresh are fixed... does tha mean the dex side is good to go?

[26-Feb-19 05:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Any other things to check?

[26-Feb-19 05:26 PM] TonyL#3577
In general I think DEX is good - possible to buy/sell, check incoming orders and etc.

[26-Feb-19 05:26 PM] Cryptofist#7504
excellent

[26-Feb-19 05:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Only other issues i saw were crashing the tui or getting booted when I entered the wrong info. 
ideally, id like a second chance with out having to start over. üòâ  But thats nitpicking for now.

[26-Feb-19 05:27 PM] TonyL#3577
With scanner I'm really confused - I'm scanning batons recursive, but all these copies batons are in tokenlist as well so I have to drop em from token list to avoid copies

[26-Feb-19 05:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Will rollback everything now and return to it in better times üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be unspent to be valid

[26-Feb-19 05:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes I have check for it

[26-Feb-19 05:28 PM] TonyL#3577
```def is_warrior_alive(rpc_connection, warrior_txid):
    warrior_alive = False
    # checking if it dead or not
    raw_transaction = rpc_connection.getrawtransaction(warrior_txid, 1)
    for vout in raw_transaction["vout"]:
        if vout["value"] == 0.00000001 and rpc_connection.gettxout(raw_transaction["txid"], vout["n"]):
            warrior_alive = True
    return warrior_alive
```

[26-Feb-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to do tokenlist to get a list of all tokenids

[26-Feb-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
then playerinfo to get the batontxid

[26-Feb-19 05:28 PM] TonyL#3577
```    token_list = rpc_connection.tokenlist()
    my_warriors_list = rogue_players_list(rpc_connection)
    warriors_list = {}
    for token in token_list:
        player_info = rogue_player_info(rpc_connection, token)
        if "status" in player_info and player_info["status"] == "error":
            pass
        # if yes - finding most actual playertxid first
        else:
            while True:
                if "batontxid" in player_info["player"].keys():
                    player_info = rogue_player_info(rpc_connection, player_info["player"]["batontxid"])
                else:
                    warrior_txid = player_info["player"]["playertxid"]
                    # not including if warrior is dead
                    if not is_warrior_alive(rpc_connection, warrior_txid):
                        pass
                    else:
                        # not including if warrior is dead
                        player_info = rogue_player_info(rpc_connection, warrior_txid)
                        warriors_list[token] = player_info["player"]
                    break
    return warriors_list
```

[26-Feb-19 05:29 PM] TonyL#3577
I have mistake somewhere but can't understand

[26-Feb-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt that all you need?

[26-Feb-19 05:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Mistake in my code üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you figured it out?

[26-Feb-19 05:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Separate all parts are working - but in complex I'm getting copies by some reason. Just need to debug propertly

[26-Feb-19 05:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, I think I was confused on some point because many of warriors with "Ronyi" name were in TOP20

[26-Feb-19 05:54 PM] TonyL#3577
12 `Ronyi` in top20 üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 05:55 PM] TonyL#3577
```Name: Ronyi

Player txid: 28f0dcda2d21270d49f70d8f34ba921dd38dd7234fd417e4d5bcb0ca9001965a
Token txid: 81e9cb77a7be66bdd62b1e41cf67c0742f744e99f94f3be066d747d355212db9
Hitpoints: 61
Strength: 17
Level: 9
Experience: 1589
Dungeon Level: 2

20 place.

================================

Name: Ronyi

Player txid: 29c0fd8489f741b7daa9789f58fb553935c2784fc656f2ea1d6df76333189d46

Strength: 16
Level: 9
Experience: 1539
Dungeon Level: 1

```

And some have quite similar level/experience

[26-Feb-19 05:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah. There's many. Lol

[26-Feb-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
So initially I've messed with `Player txid: ` `Token txid: ` prints and thought that there are copies of same warrior

[26-Feb-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Now I fixed prints and can see that they have different tokeinds

[26-Feb-19 05:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
**side note** can we use an address to get a list of warriors from that specific address only?  I think it would be awesome if we were able to share wallets to have others look through one person's warriors specfically.

[26-Feb-19 06:00 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL I'm going to work on some other things. Let me know when you need me to come back and check.

üëç 

[26-Feb-19 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
At the moment way (which I know at least) to check somebody list is to start the daemon with his pubkey in -pubkey= param

[26-Feb-19 06:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Cool. Just thinking from a player community perspective , I thought that would be neat. Anyway we can showcase the Dex too.

[26-Feb-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
[12] printing all-all warriors on chain

[26-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It's overwhelming is why I thought of single address.

[26-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Interactive for players to look through each other's lists

[26-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Like trade binders in magic.

[26-Feb-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm very unlikely will make any filters and etc. in TUI since it will not help to testing
Imo it's possible to implement on DEX GUI side

[26-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Just an idea for later if possible.

[26-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Good point.

[26-Feb-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Possible to display only warriors with needed levels lets say

[26-Feb-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Or even with specific item - GUI backend can sort it

[26-Feb-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Display warriors for specific pubkey (maybe new RPC call is needed)

[26-Feb-19 06:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
That would be neat. The digestion ring can fetch a good price on any level Warrior.

[26-Feb-19 06:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I guess what I was originally thinking was something like [14]. Search address for warrior tokens

[26-Feb-19 06:09 PM] TonyL#3577
When you have a list with all players and all inventories - you may do whatever you like with em

[26-Feb-19 06:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Version with fixed top20 rating is in master.
It forming rating in --- 4.7629921436309814 seconds ---,  scanning through batons added some time - but with caching on application side it shouldn't be problem + my scanning algo can be improved I bet

[26-Feb-19 06:14 PM] TonyL#3577
To place your warrior on 20 place of rating  you need some with `Experience: 1539`+
Ronyi set high mark üòÉ

@Cryptofist If you're available now we may try some multiplayer on latest TUI from master branch - I've changed some suspicious moments

[26-Feb-19 06:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Played short game against myself - on one node was executed highlander, on other one bailout - so I wonder it's playable

[26-Feb-19 06:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe somebody else around to clash? üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 07:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok!

[26-Feb-19 07:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
for a few minutes for sure

Missing a few stuff.

[26-Feb-19 07:23 PM] TonyL#3577
It's possible to carry `strength * 2` items

[26-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to do an addressutxos rpc call with the address for a pubkeys CC asset address

[26-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you can get that address with tokensaddress pubkey

[26-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
then filter the 1 satoshi outputs

[26-Feb-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess going into DEX will change the address though...

[26-Feb-19 07:25 PM] ronyi#5719
I restored strenght, but nothing.

[26-Feb-19 07:26 PM] ronyi#5719
If i bailout my stuff is gone i think.

[26-Feb-19 07:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I think so

[26-Feb-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
proper pack strategy requires dumping excess items before bailing out

[26-Feb-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
its like trying to take too much with you in a parachute. stuff just falls into the abyss

[26-Feb-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
we should document this and any other gameplay changes that have been made

[26-Feb-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh a lot of good ronyi's rings are in abyss now

[26-Feb-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
rings especially, they will fall out of pockets

[26-Feb-19 07:32 PM] TonyL#3577
I pin so we not miss this important step

[26-Feb-19 07:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Regards rogue rings - I can't imagine how huge these rings should be so you can wear only one per hand üòÇ

[26-Feb-19 07:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm or maybe warrior lost 8 fingers in warriors academy

[26-Feb-19 07:35 PM] TonyL#3577
ü§î

[26-Feb-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
its not the size

[26-Feb-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the rings magics would intefere with each other if they are too close

[26-Feb-19 07:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha!

[26-Feb-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
they start buzzing and get really hot

[26-Feb-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
good thing they are not activated until you wear them!

[26-Feb-19 07:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Like in lord of the rings

[26-Feb-19 07:41 PM] ronyi#5719
I'm a little sad now. üòÑ it is difficult to collect two identical rings, but thanks. Before i bailout, must pay attention on strenght and pocket size.

[26-Feb-19 07:41 PM] TonyL#3577
There should be some notification in new rogue GUIs I wonder

[26-Feb-19 07:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a "you have X items but in next game will be able to take Y, please drop X-Y"

[26-Feb-19 07:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504

[26-Feb-19 07:42 PM] ronyi#5719

[26-Feb-19 07:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
```Dump excess items before bailout. Strength X2 = your pack size. This means if you lose strength, you lose items automatically with no decision by you.```

[26-Feb-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes a page of the rules changes and some specific warnings. on Q,'y' i will need to add a pause to get the keystrokes file sent out, though at that point it is too late to change things

[26-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Going to have to write a few things a few times to be clear.
