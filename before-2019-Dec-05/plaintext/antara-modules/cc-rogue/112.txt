At first would be great to make rogue playable again üòÉ

[24-Apr-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright Is it possible to restart chain now as CFEK* or there are some limitations/preparations still?

[24-Apr-19 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
Yes we can do it, we might just be doing it again a couple weeks from now though

[24-Apr-19 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
ie, restart it again

[24-Apr-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
I think possibility of restart is not a problem - anyway it's demonstration of concept mostly atm

[24-Apr-19 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
Will you be around much longer? Want to do it in a couple hours from now?

[24-Apr-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Sure, I just woke up so will be around next ~16 hours üòÉ

Ping/pm when you're around please

[26-Apr-19 08:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Tried to spin new chain and play: looks like there is a bug in rogue now. Games without warrior reusage are fine (after little trick with CFEKDUNG.conf copying as ROGUE.conf), but when trying to register with playertxid arg not able to broadcast register transaction:

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/nGsqGZ8CF7/

` AcceptToMemoryPool: BUG! PLEASE REPORT THIS!` print in debug.log asked me to report it üòÉ @jl777c

[27-Apr-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL nothing in stdout when that printed?

[27-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Alright#0419
Was that the first tx you made on the chain that spent a ROGUE CC UTXO?

[27-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Alright#0419
if so that probably means cclib isn't working properly on it

[27-Apr-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
@Alright No it's not first tx since it's warrior reusage. Nothing in stdout

[27-Apr-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
ok so without cclib working properly, you'll be able to create CC UTXOs

[27-Apr-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
but not be able to spend them

[27-Apr-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
maybe that's the problem?

[27-Apr-19 02:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, but bailout for game without warrior reusage worked fine

[27-Apr-19 02:28 PM] TonyL#3577
As I remember bailout spending gametxid

[27-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
yes bailout spends a CC vout I believe

[27-Apr-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
how can I test this?

[27-Apr-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not all that familiar with rogue

[27-Apr-19 02:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Sequence of calls:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/nGsqGZ8CF7/

But first I've "precreated" playertxid - created game same way, waited till game txid is mined, registered with only gametxid arg, waited for registration txid to be mined

[27-Apr-19 02:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Than in gameinfo printing params to start rogue

[27-Apr-19 02:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Playing, waiting for keystrokes to be mined, doing bailout

[27-Apr-19 02:32 PM] TonyL#3577
After bailout is mined should appear playertxid in players call

[27-Apr-19 02:32 PM] TonyL#3577
This playertxid possible to use as second arg of `register`

[02-May-19 11:08 AM] bartwr#6773
Q: Trying to use Rogue for the first time, following instructions here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game

I use command

`./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -pubkey=X -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=116.203.120.163 -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=028707f61cc4e6f32bd0fc4e5058bf6050f7879f2c3f12ccdae253710a443af518 -daemon`

So far, no `blocks` are mined and the amount of `connections ` is 0. 

What would be a solution, so that ROGUE blocks are actually mined?

Not sure rogue is working. They might be restarting the chain at sometime in the future.

[02-May-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
too many consensus rule changes were made and without dPoW the chain got split as different nodes ran different versions and now it is hard to sync to the mainchain or even know which one is the mainchain

[02-May-19 08:44 PM] bartwr#6773
Perfect, thank you for your reply. I'll run 2 ROGUE nodes myself, that should work if I'm correct.

[02-May-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you change the -ac_reward parameter you will get a new chain and can have a brand new chain

My 2 nodes are running. Number of `connections` = 1. No. of `blocks` = 0. (No blocks are mined yet)

[02-May-19 09:30 PM] bartwr#6773
I get the `illegal maxplayers` error if I do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]"`. wookie25, smk762 and TonyL had this before as well. What could be the reason?

What I've tried:

- Removing `~/.komodo/ROGUE` folder
- Stopping & restarting daemon
- Running TUI and starting a single player game (I get the error: `Something went wrong. 'txid'`)
- Double checking ac params of my 2 nodes

[02-May-19 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
is any node mining?

``` get the illegal maxplayers error if I do ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]". ``` - looks like some different error
Try to just call `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 ` it should create singleplayer game
Also `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 [1]` might work I think

[02-May-19 09:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Which problem I have now on any restarted chain I'm created (tried chain with ROGUE name in isolated from internet local network as well) is that I'm able to create game, able to register but rogue not starting:

My two nodes weren't mining ROGUE blocks yet. Fixed this by using a VPS for node 1, instead of my own PC (this so the IP address is public).

[03-May-19 03:31 PM] bartwr#6773
When running `cc/rogue/rogue SEED GAMETXID` I get:

```ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL.(ROGUE) port.31322 (user12:pass34) IPADDRESS.127.0.0.1

Does anyone know what the reason could be?

Hi @wookie üëã
Things are quite busy in Labs right now, preparing for launch.
Good news is KMD NN elections are over so that gives a bit more time.
Some of the other guys will be along to give you a better idea of what's happening.

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Rogue CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good!
