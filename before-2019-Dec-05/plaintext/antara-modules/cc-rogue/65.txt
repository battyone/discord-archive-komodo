[25-Feb-19 06:02 AM] wookie#7663
should I do: 
git checkout jl777
git pull

to get the keystrokes.log?

[25-Feb-19 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL gameinfo shows the baton, which would be the registration txid at first, then as each new keystrokes tx is made, it updates the baton. maybe what is happening is that the tx goes into the mempool, but then it doesnt confirm? querying for the batontxid and doing a getrawtransaction/sendrawtransaction until it confirms should make things a lot more reliable

[25-Feb-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
@wookie once you do the bailout without any keystrokes file, the player is dead. so the TUI needs to make sure to never send a bailout if the baton is the registration txid

[25-Feb-19 06:04 AM] wookie#7663
Is that something that needs to be fixed in the TUI? Or is this something I can do? Sorry, I'm not a coder, don't really understand what needs to be done.

[25-Feb-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are using TUI, wait for new TUI.

[25-Feb-19 06:09 AM] wookie#7663

@SHossain I just did git pull on komodoplatform/komodo's `rogue_multiOS` branch
can you please confirm if any or all updates in jl777 repo for rogue are in this branch as well?

[25-Feb-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I compiled from this branch on 19th last time:

[25-Feb-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and I guess there were updates to rogue after that 🤔

[25-Feb-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

maybe that is good. it could just be a delay of tx being mined

[25-Feb-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
or it could be some confusion with keystrokes tx

[25-Feb-19 08:28 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c`maybe what is happening is that the tx goes into the mempool, but then it doesnt confirm?` - for game where I lost warrior not new entry / entry for this gametxid was created in keystrokes.log at all. Is it creating after transaction mined only? If I can't see the keystroke attempt I can't rebroadcast it or ensure that last keystroke is on blockchain.

Cases about which players reported seems the same. Will try to reproduce it reliably.
I think if I'll track the games baton I'll able to detect the cases when only registration txid is broadcasted.

Game started fine with bought warrior

[25-Feb-19 01:23 PM] TonyL#3577
So it seems that problem is only with own cancelled orders - after order filling warrior isn't broken

Played short game with SpongeBobRoguePants - let's check if he return to my warriors list

[25-Feb-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577

Name: SpongeBobRoguePants``` he returned fine from adventure 😃

@TonyL pushed a version that should rescue cancelled trade warriors, but I cant verify it as I dont own it

[25-Feb-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to use: ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib register 17 \"[%2204be1e79a3cc3f3adaf29dbcc5ac01da577574eb654c201a3e4319b7ec72e378%22,%22fa6c506207e18546a4568b49073b42642c27759b9830fdb4dbdbcfccb0d7019a%22]\"

are there any other paths to get a warrior that you own?

[25-Feb-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
@ronyi you should also be able to rescue your cancelled warrior

Place sell order with your warrior and buy my warrior in marketplace, after this warrior killed, but is in my warrior list.

Good morning everyone!  
Jl777 please let me know when you officially decide on a winner and when you would like to run the next contest. I was thinking in another week or two, so we can make sure we have the installers for Windows and OSX 💯%.

[25-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Has anyone here played a multi-player game yet?

[25-Feb-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we need to make sure all the major bugs are fix and we have installers for all the OS

[25-Feb-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
is anybody else close to ronyi as far as totals?

[25-Feb-19 02:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I doubt it (good going @ronyi  !!) *but* maybe someone else will chime in within the next few hours. Although, I do think they would be excited to chime in with their totals right away. they may not be up yet....

[25-Feb-19 02:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Rony,i I'd be excited to hear your strategy if you had one. As well as what you thought about the game + it being blockchainified.

[25-Feb-19 02:13 PM] ronyi#5719
@Cryptofist I write some ideas and thanks all for this game.
