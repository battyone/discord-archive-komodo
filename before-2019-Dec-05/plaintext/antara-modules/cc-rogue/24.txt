Some Q's : 
1. How can someone mine ROGUE, I only have 1 ROGUE for block reward, no other info. 

2. Does Komodo need to fully be synced before running Rogue to play? 

3. RogueCC is the smart contract that runs on the Rogue Chain, Rogue is the game. Is this all correct? 

4. I saw we will be having a Dev competition, can I have please have some more info @ca333 ? 

5. Can devs can make other versions of the game as long as it's fully based on Rogue (as the engine?)  

6. The in game gold is equal to 0.0001 ROGUE. Is this correct?

7. Is anyone opposed to the logo I made for Rogue Chain (for now) if so, may I please have some input?

[15-Feb-19 02:09 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
2 = No you just need to build komodo first but do not need the komodo chain

[15-Feb-19 02:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Also, if I make any demo videos should I wait til osx, windows and browser ver are finished? Or make one as soon as the browser is finished?

[15-Feb-19 02:13 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Bail out gold is worth 0.001 Rogue and win the game gold converts at 0.01 rogue per gold, Thats how i understand Jls big pinned post anyways

[15-Feb-19 02:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, so if you do 26 floors down and 25 up you get more ROGUE

[15-Feb-19 02:15 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
to win you have to find the amulate and escape so that will get the 0.01

[15-Feb-19 02:15 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I wonder if the items convert to gold (like normal) or if the character saves?

[15-Feb-19 02:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Everything your character picks up and levels up like strenghth etc stays with the player upon bailing out or winning. this character can then be sold on chain

[15-Feb-19 02:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
At the end of the game of the original Rogue, when you win, all of your items are converted to Gold.

[15-Feb-19 02:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
not sure ive never got passed lvl 9 ü§£

[15-Feb-19 02:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it is a hard game

[15-Feb-19 02:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
The TUI is working great now ive been playing numerous games ive died , started with a new player , started with a  a saved player, put up players for sale not crashed out once. Bit of Feedback

[15-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Every ten games or so I'll get one reeeeallly good start

[15-Feb-19 02:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
cos its random im waiting for a level 2 full of gold haha

[15-Feb-19 02:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
has to happen eventually lol

[15-Feb-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
same as original game as this is essentially the original game, minimal changes to adapt to blockchain

[15-Feb-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
one is Save/Restore is disabled

[15-Feb-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the keystrokes tx does the equivalent, along with bailout for the character, though it is a bit different as you need to start over

[15-Feb-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
0.001 gold -> ROGUE, highlander gets all buyins + 0.01 gold. if you got the amulet and escape then all items are converted to gold and you get the 0.01

[15-Feb-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
due to the difficulty of gameplay, i think the value of ROGUE will not be so low

[15-Feb-19 02:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Same ^

[15-Feb-19 02:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
10 games has go tme about 0.8 rogue so far

[15-Feb-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
ROGUE is an independent chain, no need to sync or even have KMD

[15-Feb-19 02:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Teaching my 6 year old to play. Lol

[15-Feb-19 02:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
He was SOOOO excited, I was surprised.

[15-Feb-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I estimate ROGUE to be worth about $1 at first

[15-Feb-19 02:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
can it be mined Jl? for fees?

[15-Feb-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but the collectibles market will ultimately be the wild card as a strong character is able to win buyins via multiplayer

[15-Feb-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a normal coin with 1 ROGUE blockreward,maybe miners will dump at mining cost

[15-Feb-19 02:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
like paying 100k for a cryptokitty that dies ü§£

[15-Feb-19 02:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
cool 1 block reward üëç

[15-Feb-19 02:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
whats the command to set mining :troll_thuglife:

[15-Feb-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
same as any other chain

"difficulty": 190.2671699386374,
so still CPU mineable

[15-Feb-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind it is still in test chain status as there is no dPoW, nor is there strict validation

[15-Feb-19 02:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
notaryid.-1 Mining.ROGUE with tromp
try ROGUE Mining with tromp

[15-Feb-19 02:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
that ok?

[15-Feb-19 02:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
This is a TEST chain and not the actual chain then?

[15-Feb-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
well barring catastrophic problem or abuse, it will become the official mainchain

[15-Feb-19 02:40 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
pirate started as test didnt it ?

[15-Feb-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so did KMD actually

[15-Feb-19 02:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
interesting fact

[15-Feb-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
just keep in mind the chain might get reset back to genesis

[15-Feb-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
or not

[15-Feb-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
do you feel lucky?

[15-Feb-19 02:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
real lucky

[15-Feb-19 02:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
looks good so far odds of being full chain 80/20

[15-Feb-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[15-Feb-19 02:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I feel there could be some backlash later if it isn't fairly started as a new chain. As much as I want to start farming gold now....  a new chain with the releases might be best.

[15-Feb-19 02:46 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Could be but everyones been free to join in

[15-Feb-19 02:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I can hear the fudders now "Komodo devs farmed gold for weeks before they made it easy to play for everyone else"

[15-Feb-19 02:47 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I had to learn how to run it so reward for being bothered to learn ? lol

[15-Feb-19 02:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah, I DO agree with that.

[15-Feb-19 02:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I do understand what you mean though aswell, but hey i would have loved to know how to mine btc in 2009 lol

[15-Feb-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810

1.1 million locked for ingame rewards

[15-Feb-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
go ahead and announce the chain

[15-Feb-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, it seems it has been announced already

[15-Feb-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the vast vast majority of rewards will be going to the players who play

[15-Feb-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i expect miners to play a relatively small factor in ROGUE

[15-Feb-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
especially since it is a 10% -ac_perc chain

[15-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Announced on Bitcointalk ?

[15-Feb-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
you should

[15-Feb-19 02:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
that still happens? :troll_rage:

[15-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It does! A lot still! 20 a day. Lol

[15-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@jl777c That's part of the reason I'm trying to gather as much info as I can.

[15-Feb-19 02:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Since my legendary account was banned and became urecoverable i dont go there anymore lol

[15-Feb-19 02:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Can someone please get me a good sized screenshot of a grayscale fully mapped level?  

If not I can do it later.

1 part of Shossains guide misses out making a .conf for komodo

[15-Feb-19 02:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
if a brand new users trys they will need that

[15-Feb-19 02:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I will say that because there is NO ROGUE from pre-mine in team hands, farming gold for promotions for the community might be good too. ü§î

[15-Feb-19 03:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
There was no premine but early community testers have been testing since day 1?

[15-Feb-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i doubt it
