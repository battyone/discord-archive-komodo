[22-Feb-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah also ring of protection - protects and allow to eat less üòÉ

[22-Feb-19 10:51 AM] anyyna#1521
How can i solve this problem

[22-Feb-19 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
What are you trying to do?

[22-Feb-19 10:53 AM] anyyna#1521
.\komodod.exe -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -pubkey=03c0dff4c4ec057f256251c4a6c5dae92696ff956c214253d052af9287e6e21cb1 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon

[22-Feb-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
And which error you got?

[22-Feb-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see `privkey for the pubkey address is not in the wallet, importprivkey`

[22-Feb-19 10:54 AM] anyyna#1521
Yes

[22-Feb-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Just do the following after daemon start:
```
.\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getaccountaddress ""
.\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE validateaddress put_address_from_call_above_here
You'll get `pubkey:` ```
Stop daemon by .\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE stop
and for next start change  -pubkey=03c0dff4c4ec057f256251c4a6c5dae92696ff956c214253d052af9287e6e21cb1 to -pubkey=pubkey_which_you_get_from_validateaddress

[22-Feb-19 01:59 PM] ronyi#5719
Really hard to good start. Good weapon ,armor and rings (really hard to find).  I repeat lvl 1  between 3-4, find food and stuffs, then I find stuffs trying to go higher level. Never forget w,W,P in the new game.

Hello there, I am sitting here watching a presentation on rogue implemented on komodo CC, amazing! üòÉ I have a question on the single keystrokes, are those send to the blockchain, or buffered? I am hearing 200tx/s are possible, is this true?

@Monetashi it is buffered

[22-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Monetashi#8770
@jl777c thanks for clarifying curious about the implementation of this proof of concept, gonna dig in to the code. Very cool

[22-Feb-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
@Hansie Please ensure that your ROGUE daemon is in sync. This error happening when daemon isn't sync

[22-Feb-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it used to send keystrokes tx every new level, but if any had an error, it would corrupt the playback so i changed to to be a big buffer for now.

[22-Feb-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
once a reliability layer is added to keystrokes tx, we can do more frequent keystrokes tx, though if it is getting very popular will need all the 200/tx sec capacity

[22-Feb-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess we can always launch more fungible chains

[22-Feb-19 02:28 PM] Hansie#5439
@TonyL Thanks for your quick support. The app suggested to copy the ROGUE.conf file. This seemed to also help besides waiting for the deamon to sync. I can play now!

[22-Feb-19 02:31 PM] TonyL#3577
You're most welcome! @Hansie Oh, I forgot about this new requirement of config copying üòÉ Hope you can enjoy dungeon adventures now

copy and paste to the directory/folder where you are running the .exe files from

[22-Feb-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
the folder where you have the komodo-cli, komodod, komodo-tx and other files

Out of curiosity, is this the same "proof of gameplay" concept that pixdum has/had?

not sure what pixdum has

[22-Feb-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
what rogue CC uses is the actual gameplay keystrokes, it is pretty direct and literal proof of gameplay

[22-Feb-19 08:36 PM] wookie#7663
I like that, "literal proof of gameplay". 
I only know of pixdum in the #pixdum channel, I think they are going with "proof of play". I think it's @Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) 's project?
