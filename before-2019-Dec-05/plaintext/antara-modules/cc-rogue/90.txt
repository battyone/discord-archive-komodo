[11-Mar-19 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
chain started syncing in winbuntu

[11-Mar-19 04:47 PM] SHossain#0007
winbuntu syncs fine from scratch.

[11-Mar-19 04:50 PM] SHossain#0007
so, anyone with Windows 10 can install Windows Sub-system for Linux and get Ubuntu and run ROGUE or other Komodo app

[11-Mar-19 04:50 PM] ronyi#5719
Yes, trying.

[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Each time I had run it , the game and map was drawn oddly.

[11-Mar-19 06:08 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have a screenshot @Cryptofist ?

[11-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I may.... I think so.

[11-Mar-19 06:27 PM] SHossain#0007

[11-Mar-19 06:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Two + weeks ago. ^

[11-Mar-19 06:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I used the Ubuntu app for win 10 specifically. Just FYI

[11-Mar-19 06:38 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It would also redraw part of the map next to me as I moved.

[11-Mar-19 06:38 PM] SHossain#0007
yep, i'll use the same to see if i can reproduce it

[11-Mar-19 06:45 PM] ronyi#5719

[11-Mar-19 07:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Mine was immediate

[11-Mar-19 07:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll try again when I have a chance.

[11-Mar-19 07:32 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe it was fixed, since you seen that 2 weeks ago

[11-Mar-19 07:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Perhaps! I was wondering if it could have been.

[11-Mar-19 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
i have seen this issue only on pure Windows OS

[11-Mar-19 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
reported to ca333 that time. so, he may have patched it already

[11-Mar-19 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007

gold not converted to ROGUE

[12-Mar-19 03:19 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Are there any tech team members here who have time to review the ROGUE documentation?

It is almost finished, but needs review, and there are items in the tables that baseline need information.

If anyone can help, the best way to do so is to fork the repository to your local github account, make sure you are on dev branch, write right over the top of anything that is inaccurate, and then submit all changes to me as a pull request. I will correct for grammar, voice, etc.

[12-Mar-19 05:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Sure, will do asap

[12-Mar-19 11:48 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Hey! @Bryan_Beus  Looks great! This part is not a bug... 
```:::tip Quick Tip Some users report that typing the letter s on the keyboard does not properly execute the save game command. If this is an issue, instead use SHIFT + Q. :::```
It was intentionally disabled  and quitting is the only way to save.

[12-Mar-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll review doc fully today-tomorrow - no worries

[12-Mar-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577

it was the gold in the playerdata, strange thing is the tx claimed the right amount, anyway pushed "fix" for this

[13-Mar-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and also decker fixes merged, so maybe we can make a multi-OS bundle that works
