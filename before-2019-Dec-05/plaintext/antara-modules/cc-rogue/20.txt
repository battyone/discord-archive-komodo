possible, but adds the need for refunding and also the game might not start...

[15-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the way it is now, you can start for sure in 5 blocks

[15-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
after say one hour, you will know all the participants

[15-Feb-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and we can test the highlander tx with multiplayer. it is basically the same as bailout, just that it wins the buyins. it will be easier to test the condition of last man standing

[15-Feb-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so start 3 players, or even 2, have all but 1 bailout

[15-Feb-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
then the last one can do the highlander

[15-Feb-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
in order to prevent just waiting forever for the other player to bailout, if you dont do a new keystrokes tx within an hour, it becomes invalid and you are basically dead

[15-Feb-19 09:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh not rapid games at all üòÉ

[15-Feb-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
we assume for small stakes, players wont resort to clock waiting

[15-Feb-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so rapidly it goes to last man standing

[15-Feb-19 09:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's possible to modify rogue code to track deathes and force bailout tx in such case?

[15-Feb-19 09:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Just as assumption

[15-Feb-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i tried that but it was causing the hangs...I can restore it and see if it works better. as it is the keystrokes that lead to death are sent

[15-Feb-19 09:14 AM] TonyL#3577
From my experience waiting for one block after game finishing before bailout helps in many cases

[15-Feb-19 09:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually if there will not be "Press [Enter] to continue" from rogue side after game end I can force bailout process by TUI after player died :troll_thuglife:
So If someone will play multiplayer from CLI - will wait them for one hour if they are so not good people to send bailout after death. And from TUI side I'll try to not left a possibility to be a bad slow guy in multiplayer game

[15-Feb-19 09:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
How much space do all the dependencies take up?

[15-Feb-19 09:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
to run the game

[15-Feb-19 09:25 AM] TonyL#3577
```du -h -d1
3.6G    ./komodo```

[15-Feb-19 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
+ ROGUE blockchain (is very tiny so far) + TUI just kilobytes

[15-Feb-19 09:27 AM] TonyL#3577
ROGUE blockchain taking 77M atm

[15-Feb-19 09:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
so multiplayer is not yet functional?

[15-Feb-19 09:27 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not tested yet

[15-Feb-19 09:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
cool, this looks awesome. I'll try to get it going. You're on OSX? do I need to update python?

[15-Feb-19 09:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I'm testing everything on Ubuntu atm since there is no OSX ROGUE compatible daemon right now

[15-Feb-19 09:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
ahh, I thought I saw something about osx

[15-Feb-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
You can spin Ubuntu virtual machine and test - I may share pre-compiled compatible Ubuntu daemon

[15-Feb-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
In case if you'll not have enough computer power to compile

[15-Feb-19 09:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
I need  to look into it. Probably time to to build a linux box anyway.

[15-Feb-19 09:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually you can just wait a little bit since soon will be an OSX compatible daemon I think

Hi, (apologies if the is a double post).
Can the warrior name be changed after creation?

[15-Feb-19 09:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @CrisF ! Nope, if name isn't empty you can't change it

@Crabby Paddy Seems you don't have dependencies for compilation
Try to:
```sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget bsdmainutils automake libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libgtest-dev libqt4-dev libqrencode-dev libdb++-dev ntp ntpdate vim software-properties-common curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev cmake clang libsodium-dev -y
```

[15-Feb-19 09:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Then:
```cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg
cd nanomsg
cmake . -DNN_TESTS=OFF -DNN_ENABLE_DOC=OFF
make -j2
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig```

[15-Feb-19 09:41 AM] TonyL#3577
And then try guide above again üòÉ

[15-Feb-19 09:41 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
üòÖ  thank you will try now

[15-Feb-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
I saw that same message after running ./makerogue

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
and it worked fine

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
can we use same pubkey

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
as other komodo

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or assetchains?

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
theyre all same right?

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
@Crabby Paddy was it the very last line of the output of running `./makerogue`?

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
yep

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright but line 4 of makerogue is
```gcc -Wno-write-strings -DBUILD_ROGUE -std=c++11 -I../../depends/$(shell echo `../..//depends/config.guess`/include) -I../univalue/include -I../cryptoconditions/include -I../cryp$
```

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
you can use the same pubkey, but you probably shouldn't

[15-Feb-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
As I understand error means that gcc not found

[15-Feb-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
Ah I only saw this `./makerogue line 4: shell command not found`

[15-Feb-19 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Did you restart the daemon?

[15-Feb-19 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to start ROGUE chain with this freshly compiled daemon

[15-Feb-19 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE stop` and then restart

[15-Feb-19 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
And just in case it might be a good idea to clear ROGUE folder (if you mined you may be on fork) 
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/ROGUE`

[15-Feb-19 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Do it only if you don't have any ROGUE balance üòÉ

[15-Feb-19 09:56 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
okay stopped, reboot server. before i type "./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]"

[15-Feb-19 09:56 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
whats the command to start the chain?

[15-Feb-19 09:56 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or is that the one

[15-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577

[15-Feb-19 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Since you started it with -daemon param daemon will not interrupt in case of Ctrl + C, it might be good to ensure that you synced first by ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo```

You have to start daemon from folder where you did `makerogue`

If you followed my instructions it's should be `~/komodo_rogue/komodo/src`
