`117e2378a3f4dbe47a3ac81daa018cab6de615bacb752df03cdd6f441760fd71` aha - it's last keystroke txid in keystrokes.log

[07-Mar-19 01:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Just will change  in TUI`Waiting for one more block before bailout` to `Waiting for last keystroke to be confirmed`

[07-Mar-19 03:20 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI version which waiting for last keystroke confirmation is in `master`:
```Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little
Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little
Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little
Last keystroke confirmed!
```

Ohh just tried bundle on fresh machine:
```cc/rogue/rogue: error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory```
It seems atm rogue needs ncurses in folder with it

[07-Mar-19 06:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, just had to install ncurses on this machine
```sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libncurses5```

[07-Mar-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
are you checking specifically for the keystrokes tx to be confirmed?

[07-Mar-19 06:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, specifically for txid of last keystroke

[07-Mar-19 06:44 AM] TonyL#3577
```        # waiting for last keystroke confirmation here
        last_keystroke_json = json.loads(keystrokes_rpc_responses[-1])
        while True:
            confirmations_amount = rpc_connection.getrawtransaction(last_keystroke_json["result"]["txid"], 1)["confirmations"]
            if confirmations_amount < 2:
                print("Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little")
                time.sleep(10)
            else:
                print("Last keystroke confirmed!")
                break```

[07-Mar-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, then it could solve the edge cases and actually be reliable

[07-Mar-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
until this last release i was misparsing the json coming back, so it was never even checking for the keystrokes tx!

[07-Mar-19 06:45 AM] TonyL#3577
-1 it's last element from list with parsed keystrokes

[07-Mar-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
got fooled into thinking it worked as it started working much better after I first implemented it

[07-Mar-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so these are the first versions where it is actually waiting for past keystrokes tx to confirm before sending the next

[07-Mar-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
before it just sent and if any didnt make it, you get gaps and death

[07-Mar-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810

looking at the code that is what i think was intended

[07-Mar-19 06:48 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI checking a lot of stuff atm: waiting for registration to be mined, will not allow to bailout if game not started, checking for errors in keystroke tx and rebroadcast it (may help if last keystroke had error), if there are 0 keystrokes it will try to wait also and not allow to bailout

[07-Mar-19 06:48 AM] TonyL#3577
+ now waiting for last keystokes confirmation and as mega feature even after all these steps player can just try to wait one more block if he dont like extract print

[07-Mar-19 06:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, have to test this version good

If not found gold at lvl x and quit maybe lvl x-1 the result? I quit on lvl2, but not finded gold, but i found some items and i quit. 302 Testelek: quit on level 2. $$$gold.102 hp.41 strength.16/16 level.5 exp.158 dl.1

Hmm if it's reproducable - sounds like possible reason

[07-Mar-19 06:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Because there is a check of 0 gold / 0 mosters hit which couting you as dead

[07-Mar-19 06:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL you probably dont have time for it, but you could use BDD (Cucumber)

[07-Mar-19 07:00 AM] TonyL#3577
@TwilightPunkster K64 Is such approach needs interaction with game code?

[07-Mar-19 07:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I use an abomination of cucumber for automated gameplay testing (saves bucks on beta testers and me getting bored doing the exact same thing every iteration)

[07-Mar-19 07:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Never used it for Python, but some friends use it for Pylons and Blender tests, its Behave iirc

You can either soft test, or hard test

[07-Mar-19 07:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the principle is based on scenario's which you run against the code.

[07-Mar-19 07:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Very handy in UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

[07-Mar-19 07:05 AM] ronyi#5719
Another "remark": if i press "w" and "*" is not listing staff items.

[07-Mar-19 07:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Automation is definetly good yeah @TwilightPunkster K64

[07-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi Staffs not possible to wield - you can zap em `z`

[07-Mar-19 07:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Just some rogue bot is needed for automation, he can help with non-det bugs catching as well

[07-Mar-19 07:10 AM] ronyi#5719
If i have staffs(s) and press w and s, weapon in hand.

[07-Mar-19 07:10 AM] TonyL#3577
You can wield food as well but dmg will be low so it not suggesting in wielding options menu (same as staffs)

[07-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577

[07-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not clear now where it happened

[07-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
manual worked... seems maybe some TUI loop is looping too hard?

[07-Mar-19 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
```Something went wrong! ``` may be throwed on various things

[07-Mar-19 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
It's just like a `if Exception` print it

[07-Mar-19 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
But it should print exception as well

[07-Mar-19 07:56 AM] TonyL#3577

[07-Mar-19 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577

Have to update bundles asap \- it should be very annoying for users to bailout manually

[07-Mar-19 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
P.S. it was not a deadlock - just not complete TUI logic

[07-Mar-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
does this mean we have a potential fix for all known issues?

[07-Mar-19 08:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Only if there will be no "baton not found" in some middle keystroke

[07-Mar-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
In such case other issues should be non-det

[07-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at the code I can easily believe there are more nymph stealing multiple object items type of bug, that was non-deterministic as it all depended on what the system did with the freed memory

[07-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
in the middle keystrokes, I just sendrawtransaction until it returns an error (most likely due to being onchain already)

[07-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, it waits till the next level

[07-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if that isnt enough, I have code ready that extracts the current game and compares to local keystrokes and a way to adjust the next keystrokes if needed, but it could be we need a special "patch keystrokes" with a diff sent as a new tx. want to avoid this complexity if at all possible

[07-Mar-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
if we can reduce the error rate to less than 1%, that would just be part of the game

[07-Mar-19 09:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Updated bundles with this little patch (it's same 0.2.1b release page - just updated rogue_tui inside zips)
