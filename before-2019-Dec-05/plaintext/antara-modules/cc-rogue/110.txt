The guide you posted always worked for me, Tony.  Until the `69521` trouble...```cd ~/komodo
git checkout jl777
git pull
make clean
cd src
rm komodod komodo-cli komodo-tx *.so
cd cc
rm *.so
cd rogue
make clean
cd ../../..
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

can if u want, I made one an hour or two ago from a wokring node

[31-Mar-19 08:17 AM] CrisF#3405
hmm

[31-Mar-19 08:18 AM] CrisF#3405
What should I put in it?  Just blocks? Anything else?

nice work on testnet btw 🚀

[31-Mar-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
these are the problems of chains without dPoW... Also changing consensus algo along the way many times didnt help. I think it is best to do a snapshot and chain restart

[31-Mar-19 05:28 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks @CrisF do you have a bootstrap that works?

[31-Mar-19 05:29 PM] CrisF#3405
No at the moment.

[31-Mar-19 05:29 PM] CrisF#3405
I didn't make one as it looks like the chain will move.

[31-Mar-19 05:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Did you try smk's bootstrap a fwe times?

[31-Mar-19 05:36 PM] wookie#7663
yeah, I tried it twice, both with and without his nodes, but still get the same errors

[01-Apr-19 12:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@wookie uploading fresh, same link

[01-Apr-19 12:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@wookie Are you using latest jl777 daemon?

[01-Apr-19 02:37 AM] wookie#7663
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Will try your bootstrap again.

[01-Apr-19 02:37 AM] wookie#7663
@TonyL I'm using your last bundle.

[01-Apr-19 02:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Daemon from bundle is quite outdated. I'll publish fresh one with latest jl777 daemon today

[01-Apr-19 02:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So maybe latest daemon will work with this bootstrap

But I still get the same error

[01-Apr-19 04:15 AM] wookie#7663
do I need to reindex?

[01-Apr-19 04:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I'm not sure. Try to delete everything in ROGUE folder before unzip bootstrap. 
Btw ` -addnode=159.69.45.70` it's my node and it's ded atm

[01-Apr-19 04:20 AM] wookie#7663
ok, brb

[01-Apr-19 04:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@wookie  are you launching with -reindex?

[01-Apr-19 04:23 AM] wookie#7663
i did not. I just followed what tonyL suggested to delete everything except wallet and put in blocks.

[01-Apr-19 04:24 AM] wookie#7663
so far no error, waiting on the daemon....

[01-Apr-19 04:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder maybe it's because in bootstrap no `chainstate` folder, only blocks

[01-Apr-19 04:28 AM] TonyL#3577
So your chainstate conflicted with blocks which you get so thats why `InvalidChainFound`

[01-Apr-19 04:36 AM] wookie#7663
You're probably right. It's downloading the chain now, I'm still at 38000+, still waiting

[01-Apr-19 04:37 AM] TonyL#3577
It's reindexing now to create chain state I think because blocks you got from bootstrap

[01-Apr-19 04:39 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo
error code: -28

[01-Apr-19 04:39 AM] TonyL#3577

@TonyL 
I was able to play a long game to lvl22 with no problems yesterday. After that I played a relatively short game, I quit with warrior alive and healthy, but kept getting:
getrawtransaction: No information available about transaction (code -5)
Let's wait a little bit more
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/cfcr5Zhvfh/

so I did ctrl^c and did manual bailout 
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/rn5Kwh8G99/
and got "result":"success".

However, a few hours later, ROGUE was still not on the blockchain and warrior wasn't on my list. So I tried manual bailout again but now it's 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 '["d5d40c52bb02341921ef6b027b0aedf55ca07c73e4b41576dd3b2bd99d3c7d7e"]'

  "error": "couldnt finalize CCtx"
}
Here's the daemon window output:

Is transaction in mempool/mined?

When you tried in TUI it "worked" as well just transaction never mined (it checking if it on blockchain before offer to register)

Hi, I would need the list of nodes that are running the chain (just to make sure theres no changes to the ones mentioned in the chat). Having some issues connecting. Its says 0 connections.
I've tried using the bootstrap smk762 mentioned and without any.
Thank you

Is there a pool for mining Rogue?

[09-Apr-19 09:03 PM] TonyL#3577
As I know there is no mining pool for Rogue. Main concept of the chain is that players getting significantly more coins than block reward for games. So best way to get some ROGUE coins is to play rogue

its more of a mining dungeon.

I'm not sure if I should follow pinned msg, developers doc or look for last msg in chat for instruction on how to install rogue ofr the first time

[10-Apr-19 03:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
This one should work, though you'd best get the bootstrap also to save time and possibly ending up stuck on a block - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game

But it getting late for me, I'll come back tomorrow. (I've used search tool and read a bit around the chats but not sure I know what to do).
