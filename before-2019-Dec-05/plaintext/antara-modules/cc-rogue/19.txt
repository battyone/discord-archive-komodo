Maybe you quit too fast (game faster then 1-2 blocks) and no keystrokes mined

[15-Feb-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
35 gold seems not long gameplay

thanks for your help so far mate

Try to play longer game or at least wait until mempool is cleared before bailout

@jl777c How to use setname propertly? üòÉ This call not changed my warriors names from fred:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib setname 17 \"[%22tonyl%22]\"
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "setname",
  "result": "success",
  "name": "tonyl"
}```

anyone help me a bit

[15-Feb-19 07:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
i have our chain running and komodo etc done on my server

[15-Feb-19 07:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
i changed to jl777 branch

[15-Feb-19 07:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
./makerogue - no such file or directory üò¶

[15-Feb-19 07:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Should do a trick üòÉ (if you have daemon from jl777 repo not KomodoPlatform)

[15-Feb-19 07:03 AM] Alright#0419
why is %22 needed in all the commands

[15-Feb-19 07:03 AM] TonyL#3577
It's " in James parser

[15-Feb-19 07:05 AM] Alright#0419
I played a couple games, and it was quite fun. Makes me excited for the future

[15-Feb-19 07:05 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
nope still nothing üò¶ maybe itll be easier for me to make a brand new server

[15-Feb-19 07:05 AM] TonyL#3577
@Crabby Paddy create new folder, do ```
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo 
cd komodo```
then calls above

[15-Feb-19 07:06 AM] TonyL#3577

I've played more than hundred already when testing and just played for fun

[15-Feb-19 07:06 AM] Alright#0419
Yep, that was one of my initial thoughts as well

[15-Feb-19 07:07 AM] Alright#0419
you probably typed it wrong if it's asking for a username and password

Could you share full output from your console with command which you executed?

[15-Feb-19 07:08 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
alright im gonna make a new server hahahahaha, be right back hopefully il be playing soon üòÑ

[15-Feb-19 07:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe you've not changed folder hmm
@Crabby Paddy try to follow this:
```mkdir ~/komodo_rogue
cd ~/komodo_rogue
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo 
cd komodo
git checkout jl777
cd src/cc
./makerogue
cd ../..
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

[15-Feb-19 07:10 AM] TonyL#3577

investigating name issue

[15-Feb-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix

[15-Feb-19 07:36 AM] TonyL#3577
key name changing broke TUI :troll_compadre: 
Did:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib setname 17 \"[%22TonyL%22]\"
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "setname",
  "result": "success",
  "name": "TonyL"
}
```
Still fred ```"pname": "fred"```

[15-Feb-19 07:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Do I need to make new warriors?

[15-Feb-19 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Pushed fix for TUI to work with `pname` key

[15-Feb-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it was just a JSON change to pname

[15-Feb-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
found another place that was "name" instead of "pname"

[15-Feb-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the default name is now ""

[15-Feb-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but existing pname is preserved

[15-Feb-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha so probably just need new warriors which aren't freds

[15-Feb-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
and it was a string in the opreturn

[15-Feb-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so the logic is if your warrior has no name, it sets it to the setname pname

[15-Feb-19 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
New warrior arrived with name which I've preset:
```Warrior 1
Name: TonyL

Player txid: 95f68db9e81aad2af6d05c4b1c098eb1e398515f16dfdf919b64b18893b37654

[15-Feb-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
So it's kinda avatar now - cool! Don't want myself to be killed - will play careful with this one üòÇ

[15-Feb-19 08:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Was a very strange state when I can't hit, cant move and cant quit but emu killing me - I guess ice monster freezed warrior üòÉ

[15-Feb-19 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Added possibility to set warriors name to TUI - anyone who wants to have very custom warriors have to rebuild jl777 komodod with latest commits and update TUI

[15-Feb-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind you can make clones of yourself, as seen by all the freds

[15-Feb-19 08:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup once I've set name all  new warriors are TonyL upon I set new setname

[15-Feb-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if TUI wants to be fancy, it can track new playertxids and require a different pname

[15-Feb-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the setname is used during bailout tx to set the pname if the character doesnt have one already

[15-Feb-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I can add possibility to setname when player going to dungeon with "fresh" warrior

[15-Feb-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
On this stage

[15-Feb-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
So each time new warrior will be with different name if player wants

[15-Feb-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the user can use different names for different strategies

[15-Feb-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
then over time the best strategy will have the strongest characters

[15-Feb-19 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a new game preset: "What name do you want for legends and tales about your brave adventures?"

[15-Feb-19 08:23 AM] TonyL#3577
There is an option to go with existing warrior or go with fresh one, if player go with fresh one will ask it and set name so will be super smooth

[15-Feb-19 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Done:
When go dungeon choosing the name if warrior is newcomer:
```Do you want to choose a player for this game? [y/n] n
What warrior name do you want for legends and tales about your brave adventures?: Warrior1
Warrior name succesfully set
Result: success
Name: Warrior1
```
Then after bailout you'll have warrior with such name:
```Warrior 6
Name: Warrior1

Player txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9
Token txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9```

[15-Feb-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so if they choose a warrior and he has a pname vs no name, it is handled differently?

[15-Feb-19 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
If you choosing to go dungeon with already existing warrior it will not ask to set name at all

[15-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Asking  for name only if ```Do you want to choose a player for this game? [y/n] n```

[15-Feb-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but playerdata might have no name

[15-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
```Warrior 6
Name: Warrior1

Player txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9
Token txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9```

[15-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm taking it from playerdata

[15-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
It's like a new warrior creation

[15-Feb-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it will see a noname playerdata as the same, perfect

[15-Feb-19 08:41 AM] TonyL#3577
And if all GUIs and TUIs will ask for name on warrior creation stage there will be no nonamed warriors at all

[15-Feb-19 08:41 AM] TonyL#3577
So shouldn't worry that player have some unnamed warriors in inventory and it will change name for all on new warrior creation stage

[15-Feb-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
just put the check for pname is "" after playertxid is loaded

[15-Feb-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and if no playertxid pname defaults to "" so both cases bring up the same

[15-Feb-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
```{"Set warriors name (if there any unnamed warriors)": tuilib.set_warriors_name},``` there is utility to execute `setname` manually if player have some unnamed warriors from other interface let say

[15-Feb-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
good enough, as you say if all TUI/GUI have a default name, this problem will not be there anyway

[15-Feb-19 08:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, now all warriors created by TUI will be with names

[15-Feb-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the only bug I can think of now is that multiplayer mode allows to start any open spot at anytime. it really needs to refuse if it is not registered by a certain time

[15-Feb-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
its a bit unexpected that it is working so solid after so little time and with so much functionality

[15-Feb-19 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Thinking about multiplayer implementation in TUI - will need to add some threading / messages queuing to polling permanently if someone joined room so player will no need to refresh

[15-Feb-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Same polling want to add for incoming bids so player will see notification if there any incoming bid

[15-Feb-19 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes it's works so smooth - player 100 games and no any problems

[15-Feb-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
```the only bug I can think of now is that multiplayer mode allows to start any open spot at anytime.``` is it possible to give the seed only when room filled?

[15-Feb-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a room filled, then 5 blocks passed, then players can see the seed to start the game

[15-Feb-19 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
After room filled some status is_filled changing and blocks countdown counter starting 5-4-3-2-1

[15-Feb-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
So I'll say player: room not filled yet, X from Y players joined
Then when room is filled I'll say: 5 blocks left till game start, 4 blocks left till game start... press Enter to start - get seed and start rogue

[15-Feb-19 08:55 AM] TonyL#3577
And if room isn't filled after Z blocks - game cancelling and players receive buyins back
