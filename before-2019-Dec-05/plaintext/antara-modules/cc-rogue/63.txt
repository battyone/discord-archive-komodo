[23-Feb-19 02:29 PM] CrisF#3405
`ROGUE BUILD SUCCESSFUL` but still sticking on 196.
Started ROGUE after successful build but 196.
Then tried ./makerogue again followed by `make` in komodo.
Still 196.

[23-Feb-19 02:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Did you try to `make clean` from komodo folder and then just execute `./zcutil/build.sh` ?

[23-Feb-19 02:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, no.  Will do that, thanks!

[23-Feb-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Regards build on MacOS -  I wonder it should try to build libcc.dylib on Mac, not libcc.so
```Making all in src
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/make  -C secp256k1 libsecp256k1.la OPTFLAGS="-O2 -march=x86-64 -g "
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/make  -C cryptoconditions libcryptoconditions_core.la OPTFLAGS="-O2 -march=x86-64 -g "
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `libcc.so', needed by `komodod'.  Stop.
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make[3]: `libcryptoconditions_core.la' is up to date.
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1```

manual `./makerogue` built it: libcc.dylib but makefile in `src`

[23-Feb-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying straight way - just changed libcc.so to libcc.dylib in `src` Makefile - seems build is started. It not helped much üòÉ

if you dont rebuild the rogue libcc.so, it wont have any new bugfixes

Hmm usual `make clean` from komodo folder not cleaning libcc.so at the moment

[23-Feb-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the make process isnt 100% right, you need to manually make sure

[23-Feb-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
I have a one line script file:
./c stop; git pull;rm komodod;cd cc;rm *.so; make -f Makefile_rogue; cp librogue.so ../libcc.so;cd rogue;make; cd ..;cd ..;make;sleep 5;./a2 &

I have noticed many times. I think is a high warrior and/or level bug/issue (above rouge lvl7).  Unfortunately, I don't know more.

[24-Feb-19 03:58 PM] joe2x4#5987
Couple days ago, I had a high level warrior, was at dungeon lvl 10 , had around 2500 gold, two handed sword. Did a bailout, lost the guy. Haven't been back that deep since then.

I also have a warrior, got killed,screen showed the tombstone, however, for some reason I'm still able to play with him. And you can also find him listed for sale. The name is 'Captain Kirk is Dead' and he's a dashing zombie character that might not be killable, all for the low price of 1 rogue

[24-Feb-19 05:17 PM] joe2x4#5987
Can someone please provide the cli command to list the current address that I'm using, the TUI doesn't seem to list current address. I'm trying to verify that the Rogue I'm collecting( per the getbalance cli) is listed on the explorer.

[24-Feb-19 05:19 PM] joe2x4#5987
I installed/reinstalled so many times am unsure as to the address I used

[24-Feb-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclibaddress 17

[24-Feb-19 05:57 PM] joe2x4#5987
Hmm interesting. I'm still trying to understand the bailout mechanics. I started a new game with warrior the gingerninja, spawned lv1 next to an H. Got hit before equipping armour taking hp to 6. Bailedout. No tombstone death screen. Warrior is gone, not selectable. On another note, my zombie warrior Captain Kirk has disappeared (that I expected)

[24-Feb-19 05:58 PM] joe2x4#5987
Of note, gingerninja was at least lvl7

[24-Feb-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
death tx needs to confirm

[24-Feb-19 06:08 PM] joe2x4#5987
So it seems that a bailout in middle of battle still allows monster to hit and is no guarantee of safe exit

[24-Feb-19 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess "0 monster kills, 0 gold" (in such cases warrior counting as dead) validation is still here and thats why this one (gingerninja) died

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] joe2x4#5987
Just bailedout on dungeon lv 7. Had around 1200 gold, lvl 6 character, no monsters around. Character name 'elephant butt' has disappeared. No option to restart with this warrior, and not on warrior list.

[24-Feb-19 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577

@joe2x4 TUI printing gametxid at start and bailouttxid in the end
Actually if you not started any new game after this - gametxid should be last one in `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17` completed list

[24-Feb-19 07:10 PM] TonyL#3577
@_PureHate_ `  "error": "couldnt find valid game"` it means there is no game with such txid - you may check your both completed and in-progress gametxids by `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17`
