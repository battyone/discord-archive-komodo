Now I just dn lvl 1-5  without issue. But hypothermia 1hit kill is still active and trying to clarify. No another. Now i have 3xlvl7 warrior, if you think  I can make longer games and transfer for you, if you think.

the osx game, there was a quaff i) which on osx changed the seed, but on unix didnt...

Restore strength maybe or gain strength

[13-Mar-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
poison is the only one that uses RNG, but both have same result...

[13-Mar-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
do_fuses is changing rng in osx but not unix. this will take time to track down, some edge case like the nymph magic stealing, just osx specific

[13-Mar-19 05:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, will publish OSX now anyway - at least it syncing 😃

[13-Mar-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, depending on the bug, it could just be lucky that other OS are deterministic

Pinned a message.

[13-Mar-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's better to test it first (I played on new Windows rogue for ~1 hour only so far) and wait for OSX fix before spread and etc.

[13-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL So,we will all test and if there seems to be no issues after osx is fixed,  then we will promote them again. Correct ?

[13-Mar-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
There might be an issues in long games, but we might promote em with some bounty for testing - I think yes, if James agreed on it

[13-Mar-19 06:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Things should be quite stable now (at least in singleplayer)

[13-Mar-19 06:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Multiplayer should work at least in some simple PoC tests, some difficult multiplayer cases like a when all players finishing in same block - TUI can't handle

Oh really okay.

[13-Mar-19 06:13 PM] TonyL#3577
It have everything needed for playing inside - daemon, rogue and tui

[13-Mar-19 06:14 PM] ronyi#5719
Another question, i earn 2rogue on gthis game, but i see 71,064rogue to RAuQoR7wqHcyZPd7qgzHfnw1GjcChPm5E1 in transaction.

[13-Mar-19 06:14 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder its change to script address

[13-Mar-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Was UTXO of 71066 rogue - you get 2 and 71064 as change sent back

[13-Mar-19 06:15 PM] ronyi#5719
Maximum rouge in one game ~75?

[13-Mar-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not capped as I know

[13-Mar-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
RAuQoR7wqHcyZPd7qgzHfnw1GjcChPm5E1 is the CC address

[13-Mar-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
10000+ gold with amulet... will be much more than 75

[13-Mar-19 06:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh amulet increases multiplier?

[13-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
10000 * 10000 * 26 satoshis?

[13-Mar-19 06:17 PM] ronyi#5719
If i playing higher level i always see big transecion on rouge cc address and interested in background

[13-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and a 10x bonus I think, so 200+

[13-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
bigger amounts cant be paid from smaller utxo

[13-Mar-19 06:18 PM] TonyL#3577
260 coins * 10 = 2600

[13-Mar-19 06:18 PM] TonyL#3577
But amulet set dungeon level to 21 as I remember

[13-Mar-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
So 2100 if I'm not mistaken with zero

[13-Mar-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, 210

[13-Mar-19 06:20 PM] ronyi#5719
Thanks very much

[13-Mar-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
aha, there is a bug with the amulet level! it was 26 in one place (validation) and 21 in finish game

I saw only string with 21 in one of commits

[13-Mar-19 06:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh it's not stupid - have to add it to doc also that amulet finding sets dl on 21

[13-Mar-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sets to 26

[13-Mar-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810

pushed fix

[13-Mar-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it was a problem for all OS!

[13-Mar-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
turn_see is a normal function that was used as a daemon, and it was passed 2 args instead of 1, which changed the value it was using, depending on whatever was top of stack. very very bad and leads to memory problems or random crash, or just non-deterministic behavior

[13-Mar-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and the longer the game the more likely this happened

[13-Mar-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so the long game lost players might be fixed now

unless there is an even rarer edge case

[13-Mar-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely rebuild this is memory corruption level bug

[13-Mar-19 07:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, really nice to hear (that this bug is not here anymore). Is only rogue needs to be updated or daemon as well?

[13-Mar-19 07:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, some changes in RPC so both 😃
Removed 0.2.2 - will prepare 0.2.2a soon

[13-Mar-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
