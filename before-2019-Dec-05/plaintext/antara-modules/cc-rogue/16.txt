there can only be one libcc

[14-Feb-19 12:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh! I thought I had to make the libcc after makerouge.
will try again only with makerogue and then kmd src make

[14-Feb-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
makerougue makes libcc

[14-Feb-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, checked the script, clear. üëç thanks

Published massive UX improvement for TUI warriors trading
Beside of prints beatifying warriors scanner is improved and it's not showing your warriors anymore when prints all warriors on chain

[14-Feb-19 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Incoming bids scanner improved also and warriors choosing when starting new game more informative now.
Still struggling to make `mytokenorders` call works with RPC lib so for now cancel/check orders is possible only via CLI, and warriors not tracking as warriors after you place it in order

[14-Feb-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Would be great if someone will try to play, exchange warriors each other and left feedback

[14-Feb-19 01:35 PM] CrisF#3405

That went very smoothly in the TUI, Tony.  Great job üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 01:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Great! After tx confirmation it should appear in `Check my warriors list` and you'll able to choose it when go dungeon by `[7] Start singleplayer training game (creating, registering and starting game)`

[14-Feb-19 01:37 PM] CrisF#3405
```You own 1 warriors
```

[14-Feb-19 01:37 PM] CrisF#3405

@Crabby Paddy  Get virtual box, install ubuntu, update it, install komodo (this takes the longest) then use the getting started with rogue doc to install rogue, then you can play.

[14-Feb-19 01:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Start with the updated version of ubuntu, when you make your virtual box machine, use 4 gigs of ram and a 20 gig HD to avoid any obnoxious install problems as a  linux noob. I just did all of this and didnt know how to do any of it 4 days ago.

[14-Feb-19 01:58 PM] TonyL#3577

what do I do next?

[14-Feb-19 02:48 PM] SHossain#0007
don't get killed. just use `Q` to quit (capital letter) on more than level 2. wait for mempool to be cleared, then use `bailout` command

[14-Feb-19 02:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, let me try again

[14-Feb-19 02:48 PM] SHossain#0007
just change `gameinfo` to `bailout` with same other params.

[14-Feb-19 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
make sure that you have some gold. bailout will give you ROGUE converted from gold

[14-Feb-19 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
0.1% i guess

[14-Feb-19 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
then, if you did quit a lot of things in your pack and high level, put a sell order of your player.

[14-Feb-19 02:50 PM] SHossain#0007
buy another player from someone else and play with that

if I press `q` it doesn't quit

[14-Feb-19 02:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so bailout is ran, and game still running, means it's not bailout?

[14-Feb-19 02:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
feeling confused

[14-Feb-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to quit from current game first

[14-Feb-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
use `SHIFT + q` then `y` then `ENTER`

[14-Feb-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
after that, wait for mempool to be cleared

[14-Feb-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
then, execute `bailout`

I also played with web interface and it works

[14-Feb-19 03:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
as I understood so far, game playes fine with web interface

[14-Feb-19 03:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the APIs are all from the komodo-cli

[14-Feb-19 03:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that means I just need to add the cc API to my kmdgo package and can just give control to user in mixed window.
like with buttons and form for komodo specific actions
and an iframe or just a `<div>` with the web terminal showing that web shell in it.

[14-Feb-19 03:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and user can just execute all what the user wants with both clicks and keyboard actions in web shell

[14-Feb-19 03:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[14-Feb-19 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
