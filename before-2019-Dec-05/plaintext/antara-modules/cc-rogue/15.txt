i actually didn't save any game today. just started playing with latest source

[14-Feb-19 10:24 AM] Axionesti#5437
I got the error after doing 'Compile rogue and Komodo"

[14-Feb-19 10:24 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, a lot of info for users

[14-Feb-19 10:25 AM] ca333#0118
nice @jl777c - that s a very useful func() `cclibinfo`

[14-Feb-19 10:25 AM] ca333#0118
@Axionesti but you are using OSX - correct?

[14-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Axionesti#5437
correct

[14-Feb-19 10:40 AM] ca333#0118
ok - the above instructions are for linux. you will first have to install a few OSX specific dependencies via homebrew (brew.sh) before building KMD and rogue on OSX.

[14-Feb-19 10:40 AM] ca333#0118
@SHossain can you plz provide @Axionesti the OSX build infos.

[14-Feb-19 10:42 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. let me install in OSX first on my end to see if everything is working fine and will post the steps.

@jl777c tested a solution to play it via browser

[14-Feb-19 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
need to make some more testing and then can make it a GUI App

[14-Feb-19 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least for Linux, it's very much doable

[14-Feb-19 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
great job @grewalsatinder üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 10:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no problem mate.... took me good amount of duckduckgo search

[14-Feb-19 10:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was looking for web shell solution via golang, but it was something idependent

[14-Feb-19 10:54 AM] ca333#0118
@SHossain have you built komodod before

[14-Feb-19 10:54 AM] ca333#0118
or did you call makerogue straight

[14-Feb-19 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
`./makerogue` is the first step

[14-Feb-19 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
before compiling komodod

[14-Feb-19 10:55 AM] ca333#0118
you wont be able to build rogue first without building komodod which has the db_cxx.h as part of the dependency build

[14-Feb-19 10:55 AM] ca333#0118
so the path to go is initiate the komodod build

[14-Feb-19 10:55 AM] ca333#0118
once you see libboost has been built

[14-Feb-19 10:56 AM] ca333#0118
like once you see the dependencies have been built you can build rogue

[14-Feb-19 10:56 AM] ca333#0118
also need to include the osx dependency libs into the build process

[14-Feb-19 10:56 AM] ca333#0118
i will quickly look into makerogue

[14-Feb-19 10:56 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. i tried to follow the steps we use for Linux .

[14-Feb-19 10:56 AM] ca333#0118
you working on jl777 branch?

[14-Feb-19 10:57 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[14-Feb-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so build komodod first, then makerogue, then build komodod again, might work

[14-Feb-19 11:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Solved on Mac as well!

[14-Feb-19 11:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think with this new solution, it will work on both Mac and Linux.
Will need to test it on Windows.

[14-Feb-19 11:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for now, I'll just go with Mac and Linux

[14-Feb-19 11:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And it is better solution than previous one I found

[14-Feb-19 11:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

that means I can make a Go based Desktop App

[14-Feb-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
nice! so it is talking to komodod?

[14-Feb-19 11:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I only ran rogue binary

[14-Feb-19 11:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It will do anything you think a Terminal application can do

[14-Feb-19 11:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is a Terminal over Web interface

[14-Feb-19 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but only the specific application or binary.

[14-Feb-19 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
advantage for me using this Go based web TTY is that I can manage to make a mix of Terminal and Web application, a Desktop Application.

[14-Feb-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can show scores, tournaments, sales Dex etc etc in same window

[14-Feb-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
rogue app is issuing komodo-cli calls

[14-Feb-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
are you able to do a bailout tx and collect gold ?

[14-Feb-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no issue as I understand it's usage, can manage komodo-cli commands too

[14-Feb-19 11:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I should try the play, and just verify that

[14-Feb-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it is inside rogue dapp

[14-Feb-19 11:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sure, let me follow the instructions and just play it

[14-Feb-19 11:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
shouldn't just go with assumptions

[14-Feb-19 12:00 PM] Axionesti#5437
Sound nice. So, it's ok to play on OSX now ? Any new guide to follow ?

[14-Feb-19 12:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]"`
@jl777c I guess you mean this command is only available via `komodo-cli` and not via CURL/RPC ?

I had komodod compiled,
then git pull, makerogue, makecclib, then `make` in komodo src dir

if you did makecclib after makerogue,it overwrote the rogue libcc with the sudoku one
