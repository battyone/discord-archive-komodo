all ROGUE rpc calls autobroadcast

[16-Feb-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
And game hanged... 
Seems like there are some bugs after ncurses removement.
Also after last update sometimes when quit of inventory double press of Enter needed to get focus back

investigating

[16-Feb-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it locked up with 100% CPU usage?

[16-Feb-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
you are doing -daemon?

[16-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
really, there is no effective code change with latest, or shouldnt be

[16-Feb-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope, daemon is fine

[16-Feb-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Rogue itself hanged after I've picked up item which labeled as `{`

[16-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
what is {

[16-Feb-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
potion should be !

[16-Feb-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
When you pickup item label assigning (key by which you can use it then) - I've highlited on screenshot

[16-Feb-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Usually it's a letter like `a`, `b`, `c` ...

[16-Feb-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
But by some reason `{` assigned and game immediately hanged

[16-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
this might have been there before? how did you assign key?

[16-Feb-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
It's assigning automatically on pick-up

[16-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
cat you play on rogue 777 and duplicate the problem?

[16-Feb-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Never faced it before

[16-Feb-19 10:12 AM] TonyL#3577
I will try

[16-Feb-19 10:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Is my unexpected death of `LeBron James` about which I've reported above means that if let's say no or very little of keystrokes mined before bailout CC think that player died? He had very good loot üòê

[16-Feb-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
did the keystrokes tx go out?

[16-Feb-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems you landed in a treasure room

[16-Feb-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
is the latest consistently behaving wonky, or was it just that one time?

[16-Feb-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Both cases I've reported above I faced only once so far

[16-Feb-19 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Trying to reproduce `rogue` hang on jl777 seed now - need to fill inventory I think

[16-Feb-19 10:59 AM] SHossain#0007
updating

[16-Feb-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if inventory is full that would be a new codepath, so this bug is likely there for a while

[16-Feb-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c reproduced with jl777 seed

[16-Feb-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
As I understand there is no check now on inventory overflow as before

[16-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Before when you step-up on item and there is no place in inventory printed error that "Item X" laying and you have no space
I think easiest way to reproduce just throw a lot of arrows and pick up

[16-Feb-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes { is after z. i didnt change that

[16-Feb-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but I will see if I can fix it

[16-Feb-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
`rogue` hangs when `{` appears

[16-Feb-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
It's when inventory full - before there was message that you can't pickup

[16-Feb-19 11:12 AM] TonyL#3577
But now rogue just hangs

[16-Feb-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, I will add guards against that.

[16-Feb-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
do you remember exact cant pickup message? "pickup" is not in source code

[16-Feb-19 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm let me check source code

[16-Feb-19 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
I read it whole yesterday üòÇ

[16-Feb-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
addmsg(rs,"there's ");
    addmsg(rs,"no room");
    if (!terse)
        addmsg(rs," in your pack");

[16-Feb-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
pack.c

[16-Feb-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, this one

[16-Feb-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
And it printing item which laying so you can decide should you empty some place in inventory or not

[16-Feb-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
could it be this has been there since restoring player is active?

[16-Feb-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
could be off by one in numpack, will add prints

[16-Feb-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed version with print of numpack as you pickup items.

[16-Feb-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Isn't `./rogue 777 gui` starting game in "offline" mode without player restoring?

[16-Feb-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
true... maybe it has been there since the beginning when I ported it

Updated - pack prints breaking playing field now

[16-Feb-19 11:27 AM] SHossain#0007
@CHMEX please update daemon and restart ROGUE explorer when you get some time.

[16-Feb-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think there were recent changes to daemon that need updating?

[16-Feb-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL does the printout match the number of items in the pack?

[16-Feb-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i know it is hard to see but hopefully you can see if it mismatches. I can add a print to the inventory command instead

[16-Feb-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, updated so only when you do inventory should it print and it will print the inpack (total in pack global) along with a counted value (n_obj)

[16-Feb-19 11:29 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok it's back was doing some maintenance

Thanks.

[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c yes seems correct 
6 vs MAX 23
```     a) 2 rations of food
                                   b) +1 ring mail [protection 4] (being worn)
                           ------- c) A +1,+1 mace (weapon in hand)
                           |.....n d) A +1,+0 short bow
                           |...%@. e) 38 +0,+0 arrows```

[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder where it gets off by one...

[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the inventory should be printing inpack vs n_obj

[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
```Hello , just a moment while I dig the dungeon... seed.777inpack.2 vs MAX.23
                                                                           inpack.3 vs MAX.23
                                                                                             inpack.4 vs MAX.23

```

[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Then when picking up second food it's `inpack.6 vs MAX.23`

[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Suspicious that counting starting from 2

[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
what about with inventory command?

[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you start with food and mace, arrows

[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and armor.. that should be 4

[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Bow also!

[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
üèπ

[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so the inventory count is off?

[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
what is nobj

[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i pushed another version with print change

[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Food, mace, armor, bow, arrows that 5

[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me check new version

[16-Feb-19 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
``` |........n_objs.5 vs inpack.5```

[16-Feb-19 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
```n_objs.8 vs inpack.9``` picked up some stuff

[16-Feb-19 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
```                                   a) 2 rations of food
                                   b) +1 ring mail [protection 4] (being worn)
                           ------- c) A +1,+1 mace (weapon in hand)
                           |...... d) A +1,+0 short bow

                                   g) A balsa staff```

[16-Feb-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to make it 23

[16-Feb-19 12:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Hanged after `{` again

[16-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
what was n_objs vs inpack during this?

[16-Feb-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if it starts at 5 vs 5 and then becomes 8 vs 9, that is not good

[16-Feb-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
they should be the same, at least same difference between them

[16-Feb-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Isn't food a single object in inventory which can be stacked? (n_objs.8 vs inpack.9 is after I pickup second food)
Let me try to check ` n_objs vs inpack` before I pick-up this `{`

[16-Feb-19 12:20 PM] TonyL#3577
n_objs is amount of inventory titles as  I understand:
Let's say when I want to wield:
```n_objs.4 vs inpack.9```
Since only 4 items will be shown as items legit for wield and I have 9 items in my pack in total

[16-Feb-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
some things you can have multiples of, like arrows

[16-Feb-19 12:22 PM] TonyL#3577
```n_objs.26 vs inpack.9```

[16-Feb-19 12:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Before `{`

[16-Feb-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
what?

[16-Feb-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
inpack is not getting bigger??

[16-Feb-19 12:22 PM] TonyL#3577
```a) 2 rations of food
b) +1 ring mail [protection 4] (being worn)
c) A +1,+1 mace
d) A +1,+0 short bow (weapon in hand)
e) 20 +0,+0 arrows
z) An +0,+0 arrow
y) An +0,+0 arrow
x) An +0,+0 arrow
w) An +0,+0 arrow
v) An +0,+0 arrow
u) An +0,+0 arrow
t) An +0,+0 arrow
s) An +0,+0 arrow
r) An +0,+0 arrow
q) An +0,+0 arrow

n) An +0,+0 arrow
m) An +0,+0 arrow

k) An +0,+0 arrow
j) An +0,+0 arrow
i) An +0,+0 arrow```

[16-Feb-19 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems there is some specific bug around arrows

[16-Feb-19 12:24 PM] TonyL#3577
And next arrow I pickup is `{` and rogue hangs with 
```Illegal command '^@'--More--```

[16-Feb-19 12:24 PM] TonyL#3577
You may try on your side - it's pretty fast:
```./rogue 777 gui```
Then pick up food and staff in first room and go to the right room, pick up stuff here and start to shoot arrows to wall

[16-Feb-19 12:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Then pick up arrows and it will hang after `z` arrow

[16-Feb-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so its these arrows that are not being added to the 20, seems the issue

[16-Feb-19 12:25 PM] TonyL#3577
It hangs on other `{` items pickup now - but maybe unpacked arrows is the reason

[16-Feb-19 12:26 PM] TonyL#3577
But I'm 99% sure that few days ago it worked correct

[16-Feb-19 12:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Before I've updated yesterday. Since I not changed my gameplay style and unpacked arrows before as well and when inventory is full it printed that it's full (last item was always `z`, never `{`)

[16-Feb-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
do you remember having 20 arrows like that?

[16-Feb-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
No, but I can hang it without this test with arrows

[16-Feb-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
On poision or something else - when just play usual and have inventory full
