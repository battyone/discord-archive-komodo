@jl777c question about this new call, -ac_cclib=<name>. while designing the user experience for chainlizard, one of our thoughts was that someone can create multiple clusters and name them before they even create a chain, since creating a cluster (i.e. 'purpose') first is more intuitive than creating a chain then choosing an un-named cluster by integer.

is this essentially what this allows? that is my assumption from @Mylo's tech tuesdays, but i wanted to confirm.

[23-Jan-19 11:36 PM] Mylo#8306
**Edit for wrongness**:
- Clustering comes from -ac_cc=XXX   which is just an id shared by the cluster.
- ~~The -ac_cclib=<name> is used for a filename to load. ~~

~~Maybe <filename> would have been a better description?~~
@KevinS üëÜ

[23-Jan-19 11:44 PM] Mylo#8306
That name has your "dynamic loadable library".  What I call "mycustomlib" is different to ca's "mycustomlib" because we both load them at chain start up on totally different chains, presuming we are working indepdently on separate stuff.

To further illustrate:

- I've created a single chain and enabled crypto conditions and started it with -ac_cclib=MyloGameLibrary set of crypto conditions.
- I've then created another single chain, enabled crypto conditions and started it with -ac_cclib=BetterGameLibrary set of crypto conditions.
- I've made MyloGameLibrary come with a set of 5 specific game library conditions.
- The BetterGameLibrary includes the 5 from MyloGameLibrary plus an additional 10 that enables extra in-game functionality.

The cluster id is just an identifier (but has to be a number), it could be randomly made up - as long as all the chains in the cluster share the same random number.

[23-Jan-19 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
ac_cclib is not the file name, rather how the cc is defined in cclib.so

`The name specified in -ac_cclib must match the name inside cclib.cpp` <-- from tech tuesday ü§¶

[24-Jan-19 02:53 PM] KevinS#0577
@Mylo i'm still a little confused on ac_cclib. i understand ac_cc integer and setting that, but for a user, setting an integer doesn't really make much sense. it would make more sense for them to set a purpose for a cluster which they then assign an integer, or the app sets it for them after they choose whether it should be fungible (>100) or interoperable (<100)

[24-Jan-19 02:55 PM] KevinS#0577
from what @Alright is saying, it sounds like the ac_cclib should do that?

[24-Jan-19 02:58 PM] KevinS#0577
or maybe i'm completely off base here.

[24-Jan-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
cclib allows to create a custom CC has nothing to do with clusterid

[25-Jan-19 12:39 AM] Mylo#8306
@KevinS will DM you for voice chat details.
depends on app workflow and if there's state (db) saved before and after launch of the chain project.
if you are creating a table, and ppl can plan stuff, then hit <the button> to start the chain(s), then at runtime it could just decide on a clusterid if required.

[25-Jan-19 05:46 AM] KevinS#0577
@jl777c  ah sorry, i was confused since -ac_cc refers to clusters, i just assumed anything ac_cc were related

[25-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_cc < 100 is not a cluster

[25-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810

will this be the default way of adding new CCs or will we still continue to add hardcoded ones?

[27-Jan-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419

[05-Mar-19 12:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Have a few questions

[05-Mar-19 12:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Specifically, I'm working on the first command:

```
## cclib

**cclib method [evalcode] [json_params]**

The `cclib` method allows the user to interact with the dynamic CryptoConditions module associated with `evalcode`.

Each `evalcode` module can have unique `json_params` inputs, as well as unique responses.

### Arguments:

| Name        | Type             | Description                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| method      | (string)         | the name of the method                                  |
| evalcode    | (decimal number) | the `EVALCODE` of the module of interest        |
| json_params | (array)          | the parameters to be supplied to the method, provided as an array |

### Response:

| Name        | Type             | Description                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| (each `EVALCODE` is unique ||| 
```

[05-Mar-19 12:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This raw documentation was prepared by someone else, and I have questions about it.

In this line here:

```
**cclib method [evalcode] [json_params]**
```

The prepared of the raw docs suggests that evalcode is given as an array, or, perhaps the preparer thought that EVALCODE was optional, and put `[evalcode]` in brackets thinking that it was supposed to be `(evalcode)` in parens. 

I'm not sure. 

From the description of the `cclib` method or rpc, it would seem that each execution of `cclib` will have an EVALCODE -- and only one EVALCODE.

Also, the term `method` is not descriptive. Is this referring to an idea that for each EVALCODE there can be unique methods plugged in here?

I would think that this line would be written like this:

```
**cclib insert_method insert_evalcode [json_params]**
```

Also, one more thing: I need an explicit example for the `cclib` rpc, specifically to alleviate any of this kind of confusion. 

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

what blockchain variables can it access? how do you pass in arguments? is nesting supported?

[10-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a way to expose all the functions in the cc dir, that would be really nice.

[10-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
with JS wrappers to all the useful C functions, then the JS scripts can become very useful

[10-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the other idea i had was using the opreturn as a way to pass in parameters, so that is up to 8kb of parameters

[10-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and the output would be some standard type, which in turn could be used as inputs to another JS function

[10-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so a library of JS code can be made and 8kb of JS code reduced to a txid of where it is

[10-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
kind of like defining a specific txid to be a specific JS function

[10-Apr-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe there can be an include functionality, that includes a bunch of "files" which are actually txids

[10-Apr-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to have a set of highly optimized opreturn JS code into a txid based library of functions
