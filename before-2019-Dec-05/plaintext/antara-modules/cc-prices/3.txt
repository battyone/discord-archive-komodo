[07-Apr-19 03:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thanks

[07-Apr-19 03:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and this one needs to be restarted several times for it to run?

[07-Apr-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it should sync without problem

[07-Apr-19 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers forget my last message. i wasn't aware of this new chain.

[07-Apr-19 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no worries

[07-Apr-19 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i see some pricefeeds printing format like this: ```{
    "name": "ENJBTC",
    "prices": [
      [
        3.007e-05,
        2.99e-05,
        3.056e-05
      ]
```

[07-Apr-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
are you using jq?

[07-Apr-19 03:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[07-Apr-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
plz ask jq why it does that

[12-Apr-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
in recent days all my REKT0 nodes are staying in sync. I just caught an edge case  of an edge case that really only can happen if right during initial sync, you end up missing a price move. since you just started, there is no history to compare recent volatility. it detected this and refused to accept the block. then a few minutes later it was able to see a price that is close to what it rejected and it changed its mind. previously rejected is now accepted and it reached sync

[12-Apr-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
to make this more of an edge case, that node was a mining node and it has gone on its own fork

[12-Apr-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is actually 1 block ahead. but it lost all its peers

[12-Apr-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but now the chain is on some small forks, it should resolve when the nodes propagate the blocks. investigating

[12-Apr-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
added some edge case handling code, the chain is back to being in sync mining on 7 nodes on a 10 node network now

[12-Apr-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also added -ac_stocks= to the commandline that allows to add any stock supported by iex https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/tops/last?symbols=SNAP,fb,AIG
it is quite a large list, seems basically any major stock will be supported.

[13-Apr-19 10:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which branch should I compile to test price CC ?

[13-Apr-19 10:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also, has anybody tested it on mac?

[13-Apr-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 branch

[13-Apr-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Apr-19 10:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I still think it will fail

[13-Apr-19 10:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will build it on Linux vm too

[13-Apr-19 10:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see this CC's API isn't documented yet on developers portal

[13-Apr-19 10:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, compile failed on mac as expected.

[13-Apr-19 10:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will try on linux

[13-Apr-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
how did it fail, i was able to build on osx

[13-Apr-19 10:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@jl777c can you please tell me what gcc/g++ version you are using?

trying to solve it now

[13-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it says LLVM version 9

[13-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure it matches the gcc version

[13-Apr-19 02:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c so prices is a whole chain in itself? Meaning,  there could be specific data feed chains instead of specific data oracles wkthin a xhain?

[13-Apr-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it goes into the coinbase opreturn

[13-Apr-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so you could make a cluster of price chains and cover thousands of pricefeeds and then use SPV servers to get the data

@Mylo BerkleyDB is needed I wonder

[15-Apr-19 05:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to install some libdb package, like a  `libdb4.8++-dev`

[15-Apr-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tyhe fix for that is to hardcode the path to that file.

[15-Apr-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its alkready ther

[15-Apr-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the make file cant see it... Ive hard coded that and reverted it about 100 times in LABS to fix compile issues over the last few months

[15-Apr-19 05:34 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks & thanks

[15-Apr-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
makeprices is not needed for the REKT0 chain, it is using coinbase and built in CC

[15-Apr-19 06:02 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks, i'll ask REKT0 questions in #cc-pegs later this afternoon, have to go out for a few hours soon.

[15-Apr-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
REKT0 is the trustless oracle chain

[15-Apr-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
cc-pegs is a usecase of REKT0

Is this vital for syncing? Should it not sync a block if it prints this for that block?

this is not right. costbasis should never be 0

[18-Apr-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
also what was the initial bet ,it isnt listed

[18-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the amount should be in coins

[18-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and it should display current price so we can see how it is calculating profits

[18-Apr-19 07:16 PM] TonyL#3577
`also what was the initial bet ,it isnt listed`

I wonder initial bet is possible to calculate as `  "positionsize": 0.00000100,` minus `  "addedbets": 0.00000000,`

[18-Apr-19 07:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Opened bigger position (as `./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1000000000 100 "BTC_USD, 1"` - so amount is definetly in satoshies atm) :
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesinfo 2ee89156dfbf0fd2815cecb682368bf46908287f7b5422f9922e287f23e5c245

  "firstprice": 5248.68830000,

```
Still `costbasis` is 0 and I can't see the price on which I'll rekt. But from good news - `firstprice` moved

[18-Apr-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
of positionsize is the initial bet!

[18-Apr-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the profits is due to the leverage

[18-Apr-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and the costbasis is broken. it should never be 0, it should be the maxprice of first 24hrs

[18-Apr-19 07:27 PM] TonyL#3577
`  "profits": 10.00000000,` - not sure why it's same as positionsize, maybe just not counting at all atm üòÉ

[18-Apr-19 07:28 PM] TonyL#3577
`of positionsize is the initial bet!` position size is initial bet + all pricesaddfunding as I understand

[18-Apr-19 07:29 PM] TonyL#3577
`"addedbets": 0.00000000, `  is sum of all `pricesaddfunding`

[18-Apr-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[18-Apr-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
initial bet determines the position size

[18-Apr-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the costbasis should be the 5248.68830000 not 0

[18-Apr-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it basically says that if BTC was 0 when you bought it and you bet 10, you have profits of 10

[18-Apr-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, so added funding just should change my leverage

[18-Apr-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Same as on bitmex

[18-Apr-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but even that is wrong as you have 100x leverage, so you should be up 1000 if cost was 0

[18-Apr-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
added funding gives you more protection from being rekt

[18-Apr-19 07:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, my rektprice is moving by morefunding and leverage actually decreasing
