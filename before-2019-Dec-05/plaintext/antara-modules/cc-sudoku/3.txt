also, it serves as PR material as I could see some project raising 13 million USD, just to do a sudoku blockchain (2017), so it is funny that we achieve it in 2 days

[30-Jan-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
any bugs?

[30-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
what is triggering the CC vout in coinbase

[30-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
I couldn't follow

[30-Jan-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
triggering? it is an -ac_script chain

[30-Jan-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if it is the first chain to ac_perc -> CC vout, that is another function

[30-Jan-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and I made it a clusterable chain just in case it became massively popular

[30-Jan-19 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
so ac_script will just work with any CC vout?

[30-Jan-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
`cclib gen 17`

[30-Jan-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
the `"amount"` value returned seems random

[30-Jan-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
what is it?

[30-Jan-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
amount is based on the difficulty score for the generated sudoku

[30-Jan-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the ac_script is specifically for the evalcode 17 to the global pubkey

[30-Jan-19 08:43 PM] Alright#0419
and when it returns `not enough SUDOKO funds`, is this not enough funds in CC address or not enough in my address?

[30-Jan-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses global funds

[30-Jan-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so not enough funds means not enough global funds

[30-Jan-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody can create new sudoku using the global funds

[30-Jan-19 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
and `"srand"`, what is this?

[30-Jan-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
for now you need to be nice, please dont make illegal rpc calls

[30-Jan-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
srand is unix rng, read the docs

[30-Jan-19 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
yea, saw the validation code 😂

[30-Jan-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is basically 1 day of coding and a few hours of bugfixing. couldnt fit in validation in that time

[30-Jan-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but now the adding of another evalcode is a matter to update a switch statement, well 2 of them, one for rpc another for validation

the idea is to use the GUI so it submits manual solve timestamps

[30-Jan-19 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577

@dukeleto what's to stop them from just adding `sleep 55`?

[30-Jan-19 10:38 PM] CryptoBert#4601
Are people who are not developers able to solve this puzzle also? 😉

[30-Jan-19 10:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CryptoBert I solved 2 or 3 of them manually

[30-Jan-19 10:40 PM] CryptoBert#4601
I've got the sudoku. I think I have a clue what the heart/brain of Komodo is.. but then what? 😉

[30-Jan-19 10:41 PM] Gawain#7858
things i've tried: using diagonals, rows top to bottom or columns left to right, tried excluding given numbers, converting to letters for patterns, finding 7th numbers for row or column, using fee as key for row or columns, location of 7th number in each square, also tried sha256 of all those answers, taking double sha256 of all the answers, making qr code of every square =>7 as black, converting to base 16, 32, 56 and 64, stepping through the solution with {10(j), 12(l), 7, 7, 7} steps and same for "dpow", writing numbers that would form a giant 7

Even if I login with my own 'wallet seed' I have a connection error (trying to switch to another server?) so there's not even a chance of trying it with a possible seed... (assuming I could even solve this puzzle ; ) 😅

[30-Jan-19 11:00 PM] Gawain#7858
I used portable agama pretty easily

[30-Jan-19 11:01 PM] CryptoBert#4601

updated FSM branch with initial sudoku validation. cheating is still possible so please dont, yet. it looks like most of the solutions were by using solvers... need to get some actual human solve timestamps (using the gui) to calibrate the captcha
