I am keeping cclib out of beta and dev until we get it building for osx and win without major issues

[14-Feb-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Anyway now ROGUE is the hottest topic - I think it's not a big clue if people can't play sudoku on windows right now  üòÉ 
Ubuntu and MacOS portables should work fine

[14-Feb-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Ouch, reflexively wrote Windows from small letter

[14-Feb-19 11:08 AM] ca333#0118
will "winify" jl777 branch @TonyL - we will need it for rogue anyway

yes, if sudoku doesnt build, neither will rogue

[14-Feb-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and far more sudoku players than rogue

Hi @siu - Chainmakers You tried 0.1b? Is it on Ubuntu or OSX? Is daemon synced fine and you able to call sudoku rpc calls?

[21-Feb-19 06:58 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not path error but seems problems in rpc calls

[21-Feb-19 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i had to make lots of changes for rogue and musig,maybe I broke sudoku

[21-Feb-19 07:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, it was latest, but maybe i needed to recompile ./makecclib

[22-Feb-19 09:39 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Is `./makecclib` is what what I need to use if I want Sudoku compatible daemon?

[22-Feb-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the libcc.so that is in the ~/komodo/src dir when komodod is built is the libcc.so that is inside the komodod

[22-Feb-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
once this is understood, hopefully it will be easier to understand the various things going on

[22-Feb-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
makecclib makes the sudoku libcc.so and overwrites whatever is in ~/komodo/src

[22-Feb-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
same with the rogue

[22-Feb-19 09:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I understand it. Only issue is that now jl777/FSM branches ./zcutil/build.sh making rogue libcc

[22-Feb-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
./makerogue execution is hardcoded

[22-Feb-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Feb-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
once we get the dynamic libs actually dynamic, it will be much easier

[22-Feb-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
just copy the libcc.so you want before starting komodod

https://github.com/tonymorony/Komodoku/releases/tag/v0.1b for OSX I've published compatible daemon ~3 weeks ago - there is a chance that it still works

Will test today if Sudoku still works and make OSX/Ubuntu/Win Komodoku bundles (daemon + GUI) if it works

On OSX this "old" binary seems work fine.
On Ubuntu built latest FSM now (just changed ./makerogue to ./makecclib in build.sh) - SUDOKU synced from scratch fine

[22-Feb-19 02:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, new daemon need cclib args input with %22 %22, thats why it's working on old OSX daemon

[22-Feb-19 02:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Before it was like this:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=SUDOKU cclib txidinfo 17  "0aaa8fdc83aa9111b1f1d143ca7baf5730cd68c02f1422b3f8cf4186959db6ff"
{
  "result": "success",
  "txid": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt find txid",
  "name": "sudoku",
  "method": "txidinfo"
}
```
But now its like a:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=SUDOKU cclib txidinfo 17  "%220aaa8fdc83aa9111b1f1d143ca7baf5730cd68c02f1422b3f8cf4186959db6ff%22"
{

  "txid": "0aaa8fdc83aa9111b1f1d143ca7baf5730cd68c02f1422b3f8cf4186959db6ff",

  "name": "sudoku",

}
```

[22-Feb-19 03:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to adopt Komodoku code a little bit to make compatible with new komodod

[22-Feb-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I standardiized with the rogue and musig params, those always give me big headaches

[22-Feb-19 03:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Great üëç

[22-Feb-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
now it should be consistent for the libcc rpc

[22-Feb-19 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
```arg_line = "[%22"+self.__chosen_puzzle+"%22,%22"+attemptLine+"%22"+timestampsline+"]"
solution_info = self.__rpc_connection.cclib("solution", "17", '"%22' + arg_line + '%22"')```
Hope I'm still broadcast solution in correct form üòÉ

pardon my ignorance but, why and what use does the new arguments have? like %22 and 18 or 17 parameters.

[22-Feb-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
%22 means " in James parser

[22-Feb-19 05:37 PM] TonyL#3577
17 or 18 it's evalcode

[22-Feb-19 05:38 PM] TonyL#3577
You can check which cclib calls your daemon supports with evalcodes and params in `cclibinfo` call output

@TonyL 

What documentation do we have available for cc-sudoku right now? I would like to get started on bringing this to developers.komodoplatform.com

[11-Mar-19 03:42 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus There is no documentation about cc-sudoku besides of comments in CC code (but it a little bit out of date). I'll document RPC calls as soon as possible.
Installation guide for GUI can be found in GUI repo readme: https://github.com/tonymorony/Komodoku

Great, thank you.

[11-Mar-19 11:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL 

It says in your instructions that we need to use the FSM branch of Komodo to build Sudoku. Is that correct?

How does that correlate with building from the `jl777` branch for ROGUE?

Do we need to have separate `komodod` installations for ROGUE and SUDOKU, and anything else?

[12-Mar-19 05:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, when this instruction was written ROGUE doesn't exist yet.

In general it's possible to build Sudoku compatible client from any branch, only difference is that daemon with sudoku cclib (same cclib as musig needs) instead of  roguecclib needed.
Now by default rogue cclib building. Easiest way to build SUDOKU client on fresh installation is change string `./makerogue` to `./makecclib` in `zcutil/build.sh` /  `zcutil/build-mac.sh` / `zcutil/build-win.sh`

```How does that correlate with building from the jl777 branch for ROGUE?```
In #cc-rogue channel description information that ROGUE should be built from FSM branch so not sure why it's needed to be built from jl777. All CC stuff is recommended to build from FSM because it's more stable

[12-Mar-19 05:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus musig and sudoku are in the same cclib so the musig instructions will work for sudoku as it is

[12-Mar-19 05:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, so I'll rewrite the install instructions to mirror musig instead of rogue

[12-Mar-19 05:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thanks

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Sudoku CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good!
