mined uses the trustless oracles process

[15-Apr-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
correlated protects against the 2% attack. trustless oracles is set currently to allow a +/-1% variance, so an attacker can push the price up 1% and then down 1% to create a 2% swing, which might be enough to change monetary outcomes. not any giant issue for most cases, but still want to be safe than sorry

[15-Apr-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
smoothed is just a 24hr SMA, average value, as the correlation is done over 24hr period

[15-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt a realtime signal, but every block there is a trustless price that is updated based on the prior 24hrs that is solid enough to settle contracts automatically with

If anyone is interested I'll post here due to JP's background and knowledge of currencies and monetary policies (traditional as well as some crypto) here's a current tweet based on the DAI peg https://twitter.com/jp_koning/status/1121418943757979648

@ricburton @newcurrency That's what I was wondering. If the goal is to quickly get Dai back to $1 when it deviates, why isn't the stability fee shared with Dai owners in the form of interest? Then as the stability fee is jacked up, so is the interest-rate-on-Dai. Vice vers...

`Based on our results, we suggest design improvements that can improve long-term stability and suggest methods for solving pricing problems that arise in existing stablecoins. In addition to the direct risk of instability, our dynamics results suggest a profitable economic attack during extreme events that can induce volatility in the stable asset. This attack additionally suggests ways in which stablecoins can cause perverse incentives for miners, posing risks to blockchain consensus. `

Hi all, we have made the initial implementation of PegsCC. For those who are not familiar with PegsCC, it is basically a mechanism to have a coin that is always backed by other crypto at worst 1:1 but it should be more - stablecoin. People deposit some other crypto (lets say KMD,BTC ...) using gateways CC in external chain and get tokens on pegs chain. So now tokens can be deposited in an account and you can take coins in amount of price_of_token*amount (up to 80% of value). Lets call this chain KUSD (1 KUSD should represent 1$) , so with deposit of 100KMD in gateway you'll get 100KMDT, and you can then deposit 100KMDT in account on KUSD chain and take lets say maximum of 120KUSD (KMD=1.5$). When the price changes, if it goes up you can take more KUSD, but if it goes down there is the problem. It is solved with possibility for other users to liquidate worst accounts that are in "debt" 90% or more with a gain of 5%. So in previous example if KMD price is 1.3333$ then 120KUSD is 90% of 133.33$ and this account can be liquidated. Some other user gives 120KUSD and gets 95KMDT (it is worth 126.66$), and 5KMDT goes to the system to improve the overall "debt" of the system. The account holder which had his account liquidated is left with his 120KUSD so he is in loss of 10% because he has not maintained better ratio on his account. This way all coins should be backed by crypto all the time.

The code is currently in my repo for testing (as there are some modification for testing so that I don't put that in FSM): https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/tree/pegsCC

Currently there is functionality without validation and probably there are bugs. I have setup test chain so everybody can test. These are the parameters:
```
komodod -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=10000 -ac_name=KUSDTEST -ac_cc=2 -ac_import=PEGSCC -ac_end=1 -ac_perc=0 -ac_cbopret=7 -earlytxid=a130861d422655cb28ffbf788c3b4a07748ba67eb7c413c9440b7cbbfcb9d296 -addnode=116.203.17.140:22993 -addnode=116.203.17.141:22993

KMD token txid:    babf52d3f8586393a3ca45e07ccd9ab247fd56c5104bef3aa6a83be3f104831a

Gateway txid:        e41b98f104d5d3a8f94742f5b0237a9efdd6999bea4af2ce64228c7280167b40

```
In order to get started you will need to mine few blocks so you have for txfee for gatewaysdeposit and gatewaysclaim transactions (20k sat). You can use the gateways TUI from here https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python to send KMD to deposit address and make deposit and claim tx. After having some balance of KMDT, you can do pegsfund to deposit and then pegsget to take KUSD coins.

[09-Jul-19 02:02 PM] Mihailo#5902
NOTE: don't forget to `export CONFIGURE_FLAGS='CPPFLAGS=-DTESTMODE'` before the build and start the chain with -pubkey=<pubkey> to use CC, and when you make KMD tx to deposit address to wait that KMD block data is posted to oracle (you can check with `komodo-cli -ac_name=KUSDTEST oraclessamples bde7c4fb8f7f402891d350715c308179193e4c961c90cac0740a7e89d561b437 REnSwBrnZtuPVPngNy8kWLAn9BjUB1F6Dw 5`)

[09-Jul-19 04:15 PM] allbits#5898
What is the motivation to deposit KMDT into the system in the first instance, given that one is at risk of loss if price moves against them and they fail to maintain their ratio in time?

[09-Jul-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you are able to borrow against it

[09-Jul-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so without selling it you can cash out stablecoins

[09-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
no need to find counterparty, no need to go to exchange. maybe in some jurisdictions it could be a tax advantaged way

[09-Jul-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
also, as long as you are not liquidated, if your coins are used to fund a withdraw, you do get a bit of a premium

[09-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
a fiat pegged and backed stablecoin, without any fiat involved

[09-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some project wants to create a stablecoin, this is a way they can do it. the issued stablecoins are freely tradeable and are expected to trade on exchanges

do crypto owners using gateways CC in external chain lose rights to rewards/staking?

[09-Jul-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice if you're talking about coins held in the gateway, yes

[09-Jul-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
it may be possible for the gateway signers themselves to collect these rewards though

[09-Jul-19 07:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Mihailo , wait, im confused. Do the `./zcutil/build.sh` with that parameter? Or were should i use that -DTESTMODE paramter?

[09-Jul-19 07:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
@siu - Chainmakers Yes, but you must do `export CONFIGURE_FLAGS='CPPFLAGS=-DTESTMODE'     ` first

[09-Jul-19 07:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

@ElectroChemical We don't have proper documentation on pegs CC yet. Working on it...

Understood, thanks

[09-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
@siu - Chainmakers You also have to do make clean now before build.

[10-Jul-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
~/komodo/src/cc/pegs.cpp has the initial design description @ElectroChemical

[10-Jul-19 11:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So i understand this properly, there is no counter party, there is a bounty for people to liquidate the trades that are in the red?

[10-Jul-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Jul-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody can borrow against the backing crypto

[10-Jul-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
once they do, if their address ends up being the most leveraged and the overall balance is in the redzone, anybody can get a 5% arbitrage fee

[10-Jul-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
so as long as people like the 5% bounty, the system restores to the safety zone

[10-Jul-19 12:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
What happens when it goes the other way? They make a profit and want to close out the trade

[10-Jul-19 12:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Will new stable coins be minted ?

[10-Jul-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
goes the other way? then it costs more stable coins to close out the position

[10-Jul-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
at any given time you can close your position out by replacing the borrowed stablecoins

[10-Jul-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i meant in the first sentence that the balance gets better if the price goes up

[10-Jul-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what you mean by profit. profit in what currency? profit on the unsold coins or the issued stable coins?

[10-Jul-19 12:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So as a example.

I deposit 100KMD and get 100USD (assuming $1/each)

[10-Jul-19 12:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If KMD goes to $0.5, when i cashout i would be able to swap for 200KMD for the same 100USD right?

[10-Jul-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
cant take out 100%

[10-Jul-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
say you take out 80%

[10-Jul-19 12:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh how does that work?

[10-Jul-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to leave some collateral

[10-Jul-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant remove all value from your account

[10-Jul-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
unless everything is settled and there are no loans outstanding, then you can just withdraw the KMD

[10-Jul-19 12:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
oh i think i am confusing myself. You basically are taking out a loan

[10-Jul-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, model is very similar to loan

[10-Jul-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
just that you are borrowing from the blockchain in stablecoins with KMD as collaterral

[10-Jul-19 12:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So you deposit 100KMD which is worth $100, you can take out $80 in stable coins for something else

[10-Jul-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and that anybody can foreclose on you if your account gets too close to busted

[10-Jul-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the $80 you take out is freely tradeable

[10-Jul-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and you can redeem the $80 worth of KMD at anytime, from the blockchain (one or more of the existing accounts)

[10-Jul-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
slight premium needs to be paid to redeem

[10-Jul-19 12:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If KMD goes up does the 20% collateral go up too?

[10-Jul-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
once you make the loan, you dont have to do anything more

[10-Jul-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if the collateral value goes below 10%, it will get liquidated by your friendly neighborhood rekting maching

[10-Jul-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if KMD goes up 20%, then your 100 KMD is worth $120, against an $80 loan, so your ratio is improved

[10-Jul-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So you have the rekting machines, on the flip side could you have a saving machine, where they save that loan from being rekt? üòÑ

[10-Jul-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
i am pretty sure dai has something like that

[10-Jul-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it is up to you to save yourself by depositing more

[10-Jul-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
or redeeming part or alll

[10-Jul-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Ok is there a situation when you redeem the loan and you get back more KMD than you have locked in for the loan?

[10-Jul-19 12:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I guess you lock in the loan then KMD tanks 50%

[10-Jul-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you got rekt way before that if you took out 80%

[10-Jul-19 12:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Ah i see

[10-Jul-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
with 80% out, at about a 10% drop, you are in the redzone and the rekting machines are revving up

[10-Jul-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
What if you took out a 40% loan and it drops 50% üòÑ

[10-Jul-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
they like their 5%

[10-Jul-19 12:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
You ca  get more if you are left with more KUSD than you borrowed. So you can exchange "free" (not bound to account) KUSD anytime.

[10-Jul-19 12:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
60% becomes 30%+40% yeah still only 70%

[10-Jul-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes your own account would be rekt, but the 80 USDK you took out can buy 160 KMD from other accounts

[10-Jul-19 12:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
hahaha you got rekt but quickly rekt others to get more KMD üòÑ

[10-Jul-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
actually yes. to rekt a redzone account, you do need the USDK

[10-Jul-19 12:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I can see a rekting bot on the cards üòÉ

[10-Jul-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it should be an rpc call that automatically finds accounts to rekt and makes a tx if there is one

[10-Jul-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo we do need some sort of document to describe how all this works

[10-Jul-19 12:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Yes, proper description of how pegs CC works would be great. As it is pretty confusing in the beginning.

[10-Jul-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
can you write the first draft?

[10-Jul-19 12:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, I'll do my best.

[10-Jul-19 12:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Out of interest is there a interest rate on the loan?

[10-Jul-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It could take into account held collateral rewards

[10-Jul-19 12:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
No, the only thing that hunts you is to maintain the account under the red zone. When you get liquidated then 5% goes to liquidator and 5% goes to the system to improve overall ratio.

[10-Jul-19 12:50 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So when you pay back your loan is there a fee?
