That's how it should work... But like I've said a bunch of times its not working as its supposed to at all

[28-Mar-19 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What should be happening is that if there is no funding available recover is used... But it should not let u recover or claim reward unless minrelease has passed. If there is no reward avalible then u cannot claim

[28-Mar-19 01:05 PM] TonyL#3577
` i didnt understand tonyL bug` 
I not found/reported any bug - just tried to understand what working not correct now.
Didn't know that transaction should be generated not by standart RPC call.

[19-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369

[19-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810

Hello!

[21-Apr-19 03:10 AM] Exile13#4458
if i am not the one created the cc_rewards on a specific chain, will my pubkey be able to access the `rewardsinfo`?

[21-Apr-19 03:13 AM] Exile13#4458
or am i using the wrong key probably

[21-Apr-19 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rewardsinfo will show all the time as long as some -pubkey is set

[21-Apr-19 03:46 AM] Exile13#4458
`exile13@TIDE13:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=EXILE rewardsinfo 76a914f4b60e6a407011458ab8cce0d994b0530b05e40788ac
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "cant find fundingtxid"
}
`

[21-Apr-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wrong key

[21-Apr-19 03:46 AM] Exile13#4458
thats the pubkey i created

[21-Apr-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not a txid

[21-Apr-19 03:46 AM] Exile13#4458
oh

[21-Apr-19 03:48 AM] Exile13#4458
noob question, whats the difference between putting (.) and not having (.) in front of /komodo

[21-Apr-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you only need a ./ if you ahvent symkinked the daemon

[21-Apr-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
generally if tesing its better not to synlink it, because you may have multiple diffrent daemons to use

[21-Apr-19 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
. in front of /komodo means current directory

[21-Apr-19 03:52 AM] TonyL#3577
It's same as you want to copy something to current directory you have to use `cp file .`

[21-Apr-19 03:55 AM] TonyL#3577
If you can execute it without declaring path to executable - it means that it in some location which in your user PATH variable

[21-Apr-19 03:56 AM] Exile13#4458
i appreciate you

[21-Apr-19 03:56 AM] Exile13#4458
i dont understand all that honestly

[21-Apr-19 03:56 AM] TonyL#3577
For example users usually making symlink as jok3r said to some dir which is in PATH variable

[21-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Exile13#4458
will research more

[21-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Exile13#4458
brains bulging

[21-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Exile13#4458
how do i get a txid?

[21-Apr-19 03:57 AM] Exile13#4458
i just created a chian

[21-Apr-19 03:58 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to create rewards plan first

[21-Apr-19 03:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Did you read the doc which James shared above?

[21-Apr-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if your trying to do this:
```start chain mine block 1, stop mining. 
create rewards plan and fund it with the premine, mine a block
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST rewardscreatefunding test 1000 10 0 10 10

do rewards add funding and get the script pubkey and op_return from this tx (no need to send it)
    scriptPubKey: 2ea22c802065686d47a4049c2c845a71895a915eb84c04445896eec5dc0be40df0b31372da8103120c008203000401cc

[21-Apr-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not really possible yet, there is one part missing

[21-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Exile13#4458
yes thats what im scrolling through

[21-Apr-19 03:59 AM] TonyL#3577
What is this @blackjok3r ?

[21-Apr-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These are my own notes for the createion if THC coin. as I am making the paymetns CC that enables it to work

[21-Apr-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We still have no concensus enforce way to pay the coinbase to the payments CC

[21-Apr-19 04:00 AM] TonyL#3577
But exile want to use rewards CC

[21-Apr-19 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
HE needs payments CC to pay rewards CC

[21-Apr-19 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as its funded from a split of the founders reward ... mind bending stuff..

[21-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Exile13#4458
yes

[21-Apr-19 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am about to start on the coinbase solution today. But Alright went offline on me and hasnt tested something else that he reported as issue

[21-Apr-19 04:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh ok, I even dunno how payments CC works :)

[21-Apr-19 04:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it specific case or paymentsCC needed for rewardaCC permanently now?

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha right now its pretty simple. It takes CC1of2 vout used to fund and pays defined scriptpubekys.

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Exile13#4458
is this
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST rewardscreatefunding test 1000 10 0 10 10`
where you created the txid

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It is only for THC coin.

👌 

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, then have to broadcast hex

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can create a rewards plan, and mine the entire coinbase to iit np

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
And will get txid

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Exile13#4458
what are those argruents at the end?

[21-Apr-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but they wanted also a founders payment... so Payments CC was needed to sit in the middle to facilitate this

[21-Apr-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do the RPC with no argumetns

[21-Apr-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will print help

[21-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Exile13#4458
just
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST rewardscreatefunding test` ?

[21-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Exile13#4458
k

[21-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Exile13#4458
ty

[21-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Exile13#4458
yes i have taht

[21-Apr-19 04:06 AM] Exile13#4458
i bet a tech guy would understand taht talking about it means to put in line as a command, but it was not obvious im sorry im not that smart technically, i am resourceful though

[21-Apr-19 04:09 AM] Exile13#4458
ok the createfunding returned
`exile13@TIDE13:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=EXILE rewardscreatefunding
error code: -1
error message:
rewardscreatefunding name amount APR mindays maxdays mindeposit
`
so im going to assign those values arbitrarily

[21-Apr-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, ideally you need to figure out what the best params to use will be, as some % of the block reward is going to this plan. Dont know the specifics of what it is they wanted myself. Im just trying to get the mined coins safly to to the plan wihout letting anyone steal them along the way.

[21-Apr-19 04:22 AM] Exile13#4458
syntax error?
`exile13@TIDE13:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=EXILE rewardscreatefunding 50K 5 5 45 90 50000

[21-Apr-19 04:23 AM] Exile13#4458

no idea

[21-Apr-19 04:24 AM] Exile13#4458
lol

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just some text

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think max 8 letters long

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sao 50K should work I think

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] Exile13#4458
it has to be leters

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] Exile13#4458
oh

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe fiftyk

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] Exile13#4458
k

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
see if that works lol

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wortha  try

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] Exile13#4458
err

[21-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there may be more helpful errors on stdout where you started the daemon

[21-Apr-19 04:26 AM] Exile13#4458
i got y shots

[21-Apr-19 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so where you started ./komodod

[21-Apr-19 04:26 AM] Exile13#4458
just `stdout`?

[21-Apr-19 04:27 AM] TonyL#3577

ah found it
`If you create a plan with mindeposit: 10000, make sure to also add 10000 of your coin and the transaction fees using the rewardsaddfunding call after creating the plan. The rewards contract won't allow locking of funds greater than the amount already locked in a single transaction as it needs to assure that it will have the required funds to pay.
