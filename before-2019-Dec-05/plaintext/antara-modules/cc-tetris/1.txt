@SHossain tweaked the timing a bit, most of the flashing is gone for me

On which chain/daemon is possible to play tetris?

[08-Mar-19 09:08 AM] ronyi#5719

[08-Mar-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810

./maketetris from cc dir and then ./tetris

[08-Mar-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
not fancy some screen flashes, but it seems to work and the codebase for it is very small

[08-Mar-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it mostly should fit into the rogue rpc, but i guess there is no playerdata other than points scored

[08-Mar-19 09:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Works smooth on my side

[08-Mar-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577

Game over!
You finished with 500 points on level 1.

@jl777c flickering completely gone.

[08-Mar-19 12:15 PM] SHossain#0007
playing experience is much better now

[08-Mar-19 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
jsut noticed one thing that, some of the variants of tetris clears screen upon completion of each level. this one keeps playing continuously.

[08-Mar-19 01:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
this is adictive! You finished with 820 points on level 1.

[08-Mar-19 01:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@SHossain  The traditional versions of the game do not clear on level advancement.

[08-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Cryptofist#7504
the other side to that is, there are a few hundred variations on the game

[08-Mar-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i see. didn't know. there are so many variants, i thought there were thousands. this one looks good

[08-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I only like the orginal nintendo, gameboy and ps3 (ultimate) editions myself, so bit of a biased purist.

[08-Mar-19 01:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
There might be thousands!

[08-Mar-19 01:42 PM] SHossain#0007
This version is good. No need to change üòÉ

[08-Mar-19 01:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Im looking forward to playing it asap. üòÑ

i have not found any issues with Tetris yet. game starts fine, and getting GTEST coins for the gold extracted

[29-Mar-19 02:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, only issue is that progress not extracting fully sometimes because keystrokes finding zero baton (FinalizeCCTx couldnt find 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 this print)

I don't know if there is any

[29-Mar-19 02:32 PM] SHossain#0007

Handling arrows (blocks movement, can work also from h l k j buttons also probably), `q` and thats it

[29-Mar-19 02:36 PM] TonyL#3577

[29-Mar-19 02:36 PM] SHossain#0007

No you can switch (I think one time per level when other block in bottom preview square)

how to properly backtrace?

`gdb -args ./tetris` ?

[29-Mar-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, I think you can check also if it reproducable in "offile mode" by `gdb -args ./tetris 777 gui`

[29-Mar-19 02:46 PM] SHossain#0007
started with gdb. and hanged after few switching.

Hmm interesting - no function which doing blocks swaps in this backtrace
Is it hangs on 3rd time when you swap?

[29-Mar-19 02:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I've started game on my side by `./tetris 777 gui ` and swapped blocks like a 100 times a row without problem

[29-Mar-19 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
not on 3rd swap...but few more. didn't actually count

[29-Mar-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
try to swap on the left corner

[29-Mar-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
like the image above

[29-Mar-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
when you have the block exactly at the left side and you swap (after multiple done), it will hang
