Oh on left side it hangs yes, in midle not - very edge case hmm 😃

[29-Mar-19 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[29-Mar-19 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007
middle is fine

[29-Mar-19 03:01 PM] TonyL#3577
And it ate my CPU so it's in infin loop I wonder

[29-Mar-19 03:03 PM] TonyL#3577
On right side it hangs too

[29-Mar-19 03:04 PM] SHossain#0007
so, only on the edges

[29-Mar-19 03:04 PM] SHossain#0007
space issue?

[29-Mar-19 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
I think I understood what issue is

[29-Mar-19 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
It's the cases when brick to which you want to swap not fit game field if to put it to position on brick which swapping

[29-Mar-19 03:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a it's beyond of edges if to put on same poisiton

[29-Mar-19 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
So game engine don't have space to draw it and hangs

[29-Mar-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, i was thinking the same. not enough space to change on the edges

[29-Mar-19 03:10 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder solution is just to not execute swap if such case detected, will try to code it 😃

It's not hanging tetris but breaking not fitting block over the wall 😂

[29-Mar-19 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
haha

[29-Mar-19 03:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I think I fixed 😃

[29-Mar-19 03:55 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Could you please add in `cc/games/tetris.c` :
```         obj->stored.ori = ori;
         while (!tg_fits(obj, obj->falling)) {
             obj->falling.loc.row--;
             obj->falling.loc.col--;
         }
     }
     tg_put(obj, obj->falling);
```

[29-Mar-19 03:56 PM] TonyL#3577
`obj->falling.loc.col--;` this line should be added, then `./maketetris` and play

[29-Mar-19 03:56 PM] SHossain#0007
trying

[29-Mar-19 03:58 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a edge case with "stick" in horizontal orientation lol

[29-Mar-19 04:15 PM] SHossain#0007

There was an edge case with tetris game hang (when trying to swap block close to the game field edge and block not fits game field horizontally)
https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/24797699?s=400&v=4

[29-Mar-19 04:19 PM] SHossain#0007
but, sometimes, it feels like it hanged on the edge when i try to switch. that happens for few seconds and next move can be displaced due to this lag

[29-Mar-19 04:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I see

[29-Mar-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
I tested on right edge

[29-Mar-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
On right edge it super smooth

[29-Mar-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
But from left edge it's moving block to the right side - need fix for fix 😃

[29-Mar-19 04:23 PM] SHossain#0007
yep. you described it better 😃

[29-Mar-19 04:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, I see what happening - it's moving blocks horizontaly until it fits only left direction at the moment

[29-Mar-19 04:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So from left edge it moving to left to right edge 😃 Have to detect on which edge case happening and if it on left side have to move right instead of left

[29-Mar-19 04:26 PM] TonyL#3577
So edge case is propertly fixed on right edge only 😂

[29-Mar-19 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i was typing and game finished 😄 `You finished with 50540 points on level 12.`

@jl777c currently `gameinfo` call for tetris shows the run command like rogue 
`"run": "cc/tetris 4188380234505307764 d6d25859e26299611b2940f8abf1568e6bf8d33b899b49496c63b57fb83b6c60",`
would it be possible to change this to ?
```
"run": "cc/games/tetris 4188380234505307764 d6d25859e26299611b2940f8abf1568e6bf8d33b899b49496c63b57fb83b6c60",
```
since the `tetris` daemon is in the `games` subdir.

Hmm, do you have ../keystrokes.log file (if check from src/tui) ?  I had the same problem when started daemon from one folder and used TUI from another daemon folder

[30-Mar-19 05:53 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i have keystrokes.log file inside `tui` dir

[30-Mar-19 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm it should be in src

[30-Mar-19 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
It looking in `../keystrokes.log`

[30-Mar-19 05:58 PM] TonyL#3577
`keystrokes.log` creating in same folder with komodod

[30-Mar-19 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
there is also one in src dir as i played manual too

[30-Mar-19 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I see. Really confused now where rogue creating keystrokes.log. It seems that it's not same folder with daemon but folder from which I'm executing `rogue`

I'm using 19.04. Whith ubuntu 18.04 (my brother tried) he can't get past the "./zcutil/build.sh -j$ 2"

[05-May-19 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
`./zcutil/build.sh -j$ 2` is wrong command

[05-May-19 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
if he wants to use 2 threads, it should be `./zcutil/build.sh -j2`

[05-May-19 05:06 PM] BlockTech#6895
alright. Then on 19.04 i get an other error. i will try on the 18.04 version

18.04 is working, he had dependancies to install.
