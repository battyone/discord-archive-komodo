It should be ok for now @blackjok3r.  Those fixes aren't needed for testing the image in a token I think.

[20-Oct-19 12:13 AM] CrisF#3405
I can test on `RICK` if I need the latest FSM.

[20-Oct-19 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
may as well do it... Hasnt been done in a while. Will merge FSM to utxocache branch which will move CFEK chains to latest. LABS and KMD will stay as is for now. If it all works ok, I will merge back to master tomorrow.,

[20-Oct-19 12:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, thanks.  Yeah, just CFEK sounds good üôÇ

[20-Oct-19 12:15 AM] CrisF#3405
@Regnar, these are the `RICK` params.  I think all CCs are enabled.```-addnode=138.201.136.145 -addnode=95.217.44.58 -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_staked=10 -ac_name=RICK -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3```

[20-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Regnar#6164

[20-Oct-19 12:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, ```-addnode=138.201.136.145 -addnode=95.217.44.58 -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_staked=10 -ac_name=MORTY -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3
```@blackjok3r, with these params I should be able to migrate between RICK and Morty, right?

[20-Oct-19 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no. the ac_cc must be over 100 to be fungible I'm pretty sure.

[20-Oct-19 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you need i will blow CFEKMYLO away and make you 2 new chains...

[20-Oct-19 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with the correct params you need.

[20-Oct-19 12:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh!  Thanks, that's why I chose to test CFEK.  Sorry ‚òï hasn't totally kicked in ü§¶

[20-Oct-19 12:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, that would be good.  Not sure if anyone else is testing MYLO atm.  Mine can use any.

[20-Oct-19 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If im not mistaken, the CFEKMYLO chains do not have the correct eval codes enabled?

[20-Oct-19 12:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Some did (MYLO & MYLO6), MYLO9 didn't (gone now).

[20-Oct-19 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so MYLO and MYLO6 work for what you need? Testing build now.

[20-Oct-19 12:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, they are OK for this.

[21-Oct-19 08:09 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yesterday I started to play around with tokens, but on MORTY instead.
was also thinking about adding images, I see 2 ways:
-either adding the images url directly to the tokens description
-or use an existing back-end API, extract images out of it based on the tokens ID.
btw tokens that I created on MORTY are Pok√©mon, & I'll use a Pok√©mon api to attach images to them

{Reactions}
üí• (2) 

[21-Oct-19 09:18 AM] gcharang#6833
if you go with adding images via url, make sure to include a sha256 hash
it should help detect tampering  

I didn't quite get the second option?

[21-Oct-19 10:28 AM] PHBA2061#2530
for example this is the PIKACHU token that I created yesterday on MORTY:
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=MORTY tokeninfo "fc658af6364f80f76f7ef92e18303ebae91b8d076757c624c7653710a7887b29"
{
  "result": "success",
  "tokenid": "fc658af6364f80f76f7ef92e18303ebae91b8d076757c624c7653710a7887b29",
  "owner": "03f6bd15dba7e986f0c976ea19d8a9093cb7c989d499f1708a0386c5c5659e6c4e",
  "name": "PIKACHU",
  "supply": 6,
  "description": "{\"id\":\"25\",\"name\":Pikachu}"
}
```
for this example only id & name are stored on chain, from the id/name on chain, which can can get via `curl`, I can fetch it into an API like 
```
https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/Pikachu
```
& retrieve additional data out of it, including images.
ofc you have to decide which one to store on chain, which one to store off chain.

[21-Oct-19 10:36 AM] gcharang#6833
now I understand the second option
anyway, including the hash in the description is a good idea
like
```json
"{\"id\":\"25\",\"name\":Pikachu,\"hash\":\"6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b\"}"
```

[21-Oct-19 10:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @PHBA2061, With the second option, how would you wiew the image?

[21-Oct-19 10:41 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah including the hash makes sense

[21-Oct-19 10:41 AM] gcharang#6833
the gui dev should know which base url the token is using for images

[21-Oct-19 10:44 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@CrisF once you have the API (either setting 1 up yourself or in this case I use an existing API), you can make a simple API fetch with the pok√©mon name as parameter, then retrieve the image url return by the API, display it on the website. I think I'll be dev-ing a demo real soon

[21-Oct-19 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Would the GUI just read the data from the API and diplay the imageg from `"https://pokeres.bastionbot.org/images/pokemon/25.png"` (found in the API data)?

[21-Oct-19 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
OOps

[21-Oct-19 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Very cool.  Is this something that is considered difficult?  (all dificult for me still üôÇ )

[21-Oct-19 10:46 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah all is difficult for me when I started learning too, as long as you don't give up midway, you'll be fine üòÑ

üí™ 

[21-Oct-19 10:47 AM] gcharang#6833
@PHBA2061 if you are looking to minimise space taken on the blockchain, you can also store the data as
```
'["25","Pikachu","6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b"]'
```
no need to mention the keys: id, name, hash

[21-Oct-19 10:47 AM] CrisF#3405
`including the hash in the description`
Is this the hash of the image?

[21-Oct-19 10:48 AM] gcharang#6833
> Is theis the hash of the image?
yes
if the image at the url is changed, it can be detected

{Reactions}

[21-Oct-19 10:48 AM] PHBA2061#2530
`no need to mention the keys: id, name, hash` agreed

[21-Oct-19 10:50 AM] PHBA2061#2530
the API call I post above is just 1 example with Pikachu as parameter, the full documentation of that API can be found here:
<https://pokedevs.gitbook.io/pokedex/resources/pokemon#example-request>
you can replace Pikachu by something else & give it a try

[21-Oct-19 10:51 AM] PHBA2061#2530
and these are just data returned by the API, how to represent those data is up to the front-end dev

[21-Oct-19 10:56 AM] CrisF#3405
What would be the main advantages / disadvantages between method 1 and 2?

[21-Oct-19 10:59 AM] PHBA2061#2530
method 1: in general if you store a value on chain, it's non modifiable, . method 2: the value is stored off chain, so it's modifiable, but if you store too many things on chain, the chain can be bloated. So you need to consider between storing on chain or off chain.

Is this data (https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/Pikachu) part of the API, or is it just data that the API connects the token to?

[21-Oct-19 11:27 AM] PHBA2061#2530
that is part of the API.

[21-Oct-19 11:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks.  Those simple questions are very hard for me to find an answer to with google :abusedsmily:

[21-Oct-19 11:31 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah it might be confused at first but don't worry

[21-Oct-19 11:32 AM] PHBA2061#2530
<https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/Pikachu> basically returned data about Pikachu stored on a centralized server run by someone

{Reactions}
üôè 

[21-Oct-19 11:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I wasn't sure if the data itself, or server were part of the API. (Or if the API is only the link).

[21-Oct-19 12:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
in short, the back-end server has some code running on it (imagine it's like komodo daemon), API are the set of instructions that allow you to interact with the back-end (like how you run `komodo-cli help` or `komodo-cli getbalance` to interact with komodo daemon, but in this case you interact with the back-end via `https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/Pikachu` or `https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/25` instead)

tokentransfer to all 0s pubkey

[23-Oct-19 07:23 AM] Win Innovation#6244
@jl777c thanks for quick reply. How do we find out this 0s pubkey in our chain? Sorry, I just started to learn komodo platform

[23-Oct-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand the question, you can just send the tokens to pubkey 0000000000000000...000000

[23-Oct-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an unspendable pubkey

[23-Oct-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
as all 0s is an illegal secp256 field element

[23-Oct-19 08:24 AM] Win Innovation#6244
@jl777c cool. thanks!

[23-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Regnar#6164
If that becomes something popular, either using that 0 pubkey or even an RPC `tokenburn` (idk if an RPC would be necessary or wanted) but maybe `tokenlist` could then exclude those that have been burned?

[23-Oct-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
these are all non-consensus things, easy enough to add. i would accept a PR for it

yes it can, here's an example of how to do it <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkjAktAA4M4>

@gcharang I just tried your node-komodo-rpc wrapper, works perfectly on NodeJS, doesn't work on browser though (or is it just me ?) , got this kind of error
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54040683/nuxt-module-not-found-error-cant-resolve-fs/54055517>
According to this post `fs` is a NodeJS specific module & can't be used on browser

[24-Oct-19 04:53 PM] gcharang#6833
@PHBA2061 I made it to work for nodejs i.e., on a server as a part of a larger application that needs to interact with the komodo daemon

I can modify it to work in a browser though, let me look into it

[24-Oct-19 05:02 PM] PHBA2061#2530
take your time, I'll be trying something else <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoind-rpc>, this appears to wokrs both on NodeJS & browsers, but I run into another issue, seems like browsers don't really like http requests in general & blocks them <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors> , have to find a solution to get around it üòÖ

[24-Oct-19 05:05 PM] gcharang#6833
@PHBA2061 are you trying to create a web ui for the komodo daemon ?

it seems `tokentransfer` doesn't work properly on CFEKMYLO6, after  sending out any amount of tokens, the remaining token balance (return by `tokenbalance`) becomes 0 (after tx's confirmation).
Or it could be `tokenbalance` that doesn't return the correct number

[26-Oct-19 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll try it now and see how it goes for me, @PHBA2061.

*For KB* üëá``` Attaching Data to Tokens

We can attach meta data to the tokens at their creation.

The maximum size of data that can fit in a single Komodo transaction is 10000 bytes. This is enough to include all sorts of data, and even simple images.

The developer is naturally free to use their imagination in the design of this data. For example, you can describe their purpose and add a json data structure that informs other software of the properties of this token.

Advanced developers can even add functionality to allow the tokens to gain new data over time as they are passed through transactions.```
