Yes if there are no difficulties with such implementation @dimxy

[07-Nov-19 08:18 AM] dimxy#2587
In cc assets most of the errors are discovered on the validation stage while the rpc creation code itself is rather simple. So usually a transaction could be created but if it has an issue it will be found later, while the tx is validated

[14-Nov-19 12:34 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm testing token methods & notice that orders created by `tokenbid` method aren't shown in the array returned by `mytokenorders`, only orders created by `tokenask` are shown

[14-Nov-19 11:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, maybe @dimxy knows why ‚òù
ü§û

[15-Nov-19 06:17 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes only asks are included into mytokenorders rpc.
(Maybe this is because we created this rpc as an ad-hoc method for some specific purpose. Let's add bids too)

yes

[15-Nov-19 08:32 AM] PHBA2061#2530
adding a new method  to check the amount of unconfirmed tokens balance (similar to `tokenbalance` ) shouldn't be too complicated right ?

[15-Nov-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean scanning the mempool?

[15-Nov-19 09:07 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I mean a method similar to `getunconfirmedbalance` , but for getting unconfirmed token balance, I don't know in details how `getunconfirmedbalance` is implemented though

[15-Nov-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it is possible, but very tricky as the addressindex is not updated with mempool

{Reactions}

[15-Nov-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
best would be to scan mempool for affected tokens and mark it as pending, but it will be much easier to wait until the confirmation and addressindex updates

[15-Nov-19 09:18 AM] PHBA2061#2530
thanks for the answer !

I just pushed some updates to my app:
- get rid of the CORS problem, so you can run the app normally on the browser.
- adding some functionalities like token transferring, ask/bid orders placing/filling (based on the existing RPC methods) which allow users to trade their tokens.
- I placed some orders selling my Pok√©mon at 1 MORTY per token, anyone is welcome to buy it ... üòÇ
- I didn't really focus on UX, so the app might be a bit messy.

can this cause error?

[17-Nov-19 05:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@Paro did you get that error after clicking on the VERIFY button ? Then it indicates that the pubkey in the "Public key" field doesn't match with the private key that you have on your daemon

[17-Nov-19 05:45 PM] Paro#7842
".komodo" completely erased. I created a new wallet and pubkey.

[17-Nov-19 05:45 PM] Paro#7842
I am trying.

rpcallowip=your_remote_ip - 127.1 is not remote

[17-Nov-19 06:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
do you run MORTY chain & the web app on the same PC or it's 2 differents PC

[17-Nov-19 06:01 PM] Paro#7842
the same computer.

[17-Nov-19 06:02 PM] Paro#7842
I'm using "vbox (Virtual Box)"

[17-Nov-19 06:05 PM] Oszy#5734
LAN is in bridge mode? same subnet?

@PHBA2061 Where is the css file?

[17-Nov-19 08:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I didn't make any css file, I built my app using these frameworks NuxtJS + Vuetify , the styling was done using Vuetify , everything was built into js files that you can find in `.nuxt\dist\client`

Hi, is a NFT just a UTXO?

[02-Dec-19 11:04 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yes, everything is utxo based, the difference between NFT utxo & a "normal" utxo is the scriptSig/scriptPubKey.
try using `decoderawtransaction` on the hex value returned by `tokentransfer` / `sendtoaddress` for example, you'll see the difference.

[03-Dec-19 02:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @PHBA2061. I'll check that out and will then probably ha e some more questions.

@CrisF antara modules use a new ‚Äúvout‚Äù, UTXO with different signing method.  Just like p2pk & p2sh differ, antara offers a new signing method to greatly expand the btc protocol.
