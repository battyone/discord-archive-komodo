Is there any mobile wallet can be used for the assets chain and the tokens  on the assets chain ?

[02-Sep-19 07:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I'm trying `tokenorders`.
According to docs```If no tokenid is provided, it displays the on-chain orderbook for all available tokens.```(`https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/assets.html#tokenorders`)
But I'm getting```
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKMYLO9 tokenorders
error code: -1
error message:
no tokenid``` It works fine when I add the `tokenid`.
Not sure if relevant, this is only token on chain (CFEKMYLO9).

[03-Sep-19 11:35 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF i'll test and update

Hi, is it possible to create more than one kind of token from a single coin?  For example, if I create a CF chain, Could I make a CF1 andCF2 token?  Or would I need to make a CF1 chain and CF2 chain and tokenize both?

[21-Sep-19 06:55 AM] CrisF#3405
One more,  is it possible to increase the supply of tokens after initial creation?  For example, if I had an initial 1,000,000 token supply, could I add an additional 10,000 tokens later?

[21-Sep-19 07:36 AM] dimxy#2587
Hi,
tokens are differentiated by their tokenid. Tokenid is unique for each created token . You may create many tokens with different tokenids.
It is not currently possible to increase token amount for the same tokenid after the creation

[21-Sep-19 07:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @dimxy ,
Thanks.
I wanted to create a token that could have tokens added as people bought them.

[21-Sep-19 07:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Can you think of anyway this would be possible using current Modules, cross-chain etc?

[22-Sep-19 08:41 AM] dimxy#2587
I think for this we need to modify the current Token module.
I guess the token validation needs to be extended very much to prevent unauthorized token injection.
The token rpc also would be changed as there may be both tokens that allow to increase the supply and those that do not. Also for NFTs I guess we should not allow this.

[22-Sep-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
self-import could work for that

[22-Sep-19 11:23 AM] phm87#7395
Can we issue a new token type on a running chain ? I think about sth similar to erc20

[22-Sep-19 11:24 AM] gcharang#6833
if it has the tokens module enabled, yes
just use tokencreate

[22-Sep-19 12:00 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[23-Sep-19 10:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it also the unique token ID that prevents fungible tokens from crosschain migrations?

[23-Sep-19 10:18 AM] CrisF#3405
DId a coin migration on CFEKMYLO and CFEKMYLO6 in Labs today.  I'll try a NFT migration next.

[23-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I also thought of self-import. Then it would be coins, and not tkens but I think to @CrisF it doesn't matter?

[23-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Mihailo#5902
But with self-import you can generate coins as you like, so it is a question of trust to that coin as you can generate them by your will.

[23-Sep-19 10:20 AM] Mihailo#5902
But still, if you want to generate new coins/tokens when people buys them then you have a single point of issue so still people need to trust that point.

[23-Sep-19 10:23 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm actually asking for someone else.  They have asked if we are able to increase token supply, if a fund were added to for example.
It seems key to their idea.

[23-Sep-19 10:24 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF, you also have a solution to create maxtokens available and transfer them to point of sale, then when people buy them it will just be transfered to them.

[23-Sep-19 10:28 AM] gcharang#6833
another solution:
As the owner seems to have infinite printing power and is trusted,
just name the first batch as TokenB1, once they are sold out and new ones are needed, create another batch and call them TokenB2
and declare that TokenB1 and TokenB2 represent the same asset
GUI can treat the two kinds as the same and end user won't know the difference

What is `self-import`?

[23-Sep-19 10:29 AM] gcharang#6833
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/crosschain.html#selfimport>
allows creation of any number of new coins on a smart chain by a trusted pubkey

[23-Sep-19 10:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I've been using that document today for the crosschain migration!  I didn't look down that far ü§¶

[23-Sep-19 10:39 AM] CrisF#3405
The self-import seems very useful.  
And a pubkey from a multi-sig address could be used, couldn't it?

[23-Sep-19 10:57 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF I don't think the current implementation supports multisig control for self import
but it can be added

@dimxy can you confirm?

[23-Sep-19 11:18 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe any pubkey could be used in self-import as the pubkey that creates coins
and self-import does not support tokens, only coins

[23-Sep-19 11:23 AM] gcharang#6833
```
./komodo-cli createmultisig 2 '["02dd22c272504af79b220ba37c12f777596eff4f54598e2db65be325a9393a3a26","032a73cd31fb86150c33f26312b665c21e5f9391829f29cf48aca03bbb4f9a2816"]'

}
```
I am not sure multisig addresses have pubkeys like the regular ones, atleast the pubkey isn't available through a rpc

[23-Sep-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh...

[23-Sep-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
multisig has multiple pubkeys, that is why it is multisig

[23-Sep-19 11:27 AM] gcharang#6833
may be the redeemscript can be used in place of pubkey to launch a chain and control the coins?

[23-Sep-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that would be a way

[23-Sep-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810

[23-Sep-19 11:58 AM] CrisF#3405
I couldn't see in the docs, is it possible to have a `0` value for `as_perc`? Or would 1 be the smallest possible like below?

```./komodod -ac_name=CFX -ac_founders=1 -ac_script=a9142706324daaac92c93420e985f55d88eaEXAMPLE -ac_perc=1```

[23-Sep-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
1 is the smallest, it is a very small percentage 0.000001%

Hello everybody, I am creating Crypto Art and selling it through Makersplace.com they are using Ethereum as a way of Non-Fungible Art registration, of course I would like to sell them in the Komodo Ecosystem instead, so is there any project going on now that I can look into?

[23-Sep-19 08:20 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
This is what I have on sale now https://makersplace.com/store/fig/

[23-Sep-19 08:20 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
If any of you would like to start this idea with me, get in touch.

[23-Sep-19 08:21 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
So basically is creating a site for Non-Fungible Assets using the Komodo Tech

[24-Sep-19 10:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) üëã
I'm testing out Tokens now, but not sure of any projects that have been working on this yet that are beyond the stages that you are at.  Hopefully someone else will know of something.

[24-Sep-19 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I'm getting below error, although pubkey is imported```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKMYLO tokenaddress
error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet```

[24-Sep-19 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
I would like to check whether a NFT migration from `CFEKMYLO6` has arrived.

[24-Sep-19 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Any ideas on why I'd be getting the above error?

[24-Sep-19 11:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I did a regular (non-token) migration on the same chains yesterday and the daemon hasn't been shut down since.

[24-Sep-19 11:45 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF try providing the pubkey as an argument

[24-Sep-19 11:50 AM] CrisF#3405
I tried that with the same result.

[24-Sep-19 11:51 AM] CrisF#3405
Also restarted `MYLO`, but didn't help.

[24-Sep-19 06:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF you need to start Komodo daemon with -pubkey=<your_pub_key> parameter.

[24-Sep-19 08:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Mihailo, the chains were all started with -pubkey=<MYPUBKEY>.  That's why I'm not sure what is going wrong.

[24-Sep-19 08:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
And that pubkey must have pribate key in your wallet if you want to create cc txs

[24-Sep-19 09:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I have the same priv key imported in both chains.

[24-Sep-19 09:04 PM] CrisF#3405
Will the same pubkey create the same CC addresses?

[24-Sep-19 09:05 PM] CrisF#3405
I noticed this error on receiving chain after migrating a NFT to it.

[25-Sep-19 10:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Could this error be refering to a 'CCaddress', rather than a regular 'R' address? ```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKMYLO tokenaddress
error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet```

[25-Sep-19 10:28 AM] CrisF#3405
I am running both migration chain and KMD with the same pubkey and have the same 'R' address imported into both migration chain.

[25-Sep-19 10:31 AM] CrisF#3405
When I tried the NFT token migration I used one of the CC addresses. Afk atm and forget name of address I used.
It was the address that had token balance in the sending chain.

[25-Sep-19 10:32 AM] CrisF#3405
I couldn't find a way to import a CCaddress, but read they were created by the pubkey running the chain.

[25-Sep-19 11:55 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF  Can you do any CC tx now?

[25-Sep-19 03:42 PM] CrisF#3405
Not on the receiving chain (`CFEKMYLO`), @Mihailo.  Tried on tokens and some on faucet with same result.  This is after a CFEKMYLO restart.  
CC is working on the sending chain, `CFEKMYLO6`.

[25-Sep-19 03:42 PM] CrisF#3405
```-ac_name=CFEKMYLO6 tokenbalance c12f85280f85d0cf4d16a24ab7295fa2baede364e7060e88202d9e92af9a6421

}
```

[25-Sep-19 03:43 PM] CrisF#3405
send chain `MYLO6` shows the NFT, so wasn't sent it appears.

[25-Sep-19 03:44 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll be afk for a while.

[25-Sep-19 04:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF Well something is definitely wrong on CFEKMYLO. Can you give me daemon command?

Hi @Mihailo, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator has solved it üíé Tokens not enabled of `MYLO` ```smk762 - herpetographerToday at 8:46 AM
same result here. MYLO6 returns 3 txids, MYLO returns pubkey error - confirmed it is set in htop. Also tested oracleslist which returns empty (not error).
assetchains.json has 
    "ac_ccenable": "226,236", 
for CFEKMYLO. Safe to assume that tokens module is not activated on that chain. ```

[26-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF Figured out what is wrong

[26-Sep-19 09:08 AM] Mihailo#5902
First, evalcode 226 is IMPORTCOIN and not TOKENS. Second, the [cc]address rpcs are checking for evalcode 0 is it enabled so it fails on it and retunrs that message.

[26-Sep-19 09:09 AM] Mihailo#5902
So you should start the cahin with -ac_ccenable=227,236 for tokens and oracles. And I need to change the [cc]address rpcs to work correctly

I need the server for something else now, but will try the NFT migrate again on another chain over the weekend.

[26-Sep-19 09:22 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Should [cc]address rpc work even if some CC is not enabled?

[26-Sep-19 09:23 AM] Mihailo#5902
I thnik there is no need. If you didn't enable some CC on your chain, there is no need for you to know addresses of that CC

[26-Sep-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure it matters either way

[27-Sep-19 07:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF BTW, the fix for address rpcs is merged into FSM

[27-Sep-19 07:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Great, thanks for the help with this @Mihailo! 
When I've completed a NFT migration I'll  set up a FSM test chain to see that and test out `self-import`.
I might be asking you more questions ;)

Hey all, I think I found a bug (or I'm doing this wrong)
I'm getting errors when I run `tokenorders` without a tokenID.

<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/assets.html#tokenorders> 
These docs say tokenID is optional, without tokenID is supposed to display all available orders, but I'm getting the error ```error code: -1
error message:
no tokenid```

[18-Oct-19 01:27 AM] Regnar#6164
And the example I'm trying to run
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/assets.html#examples-8>

[18-Oct-19 05:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy is the above described behavior of tokenorders intentional?

[18-Oct-19 07:06 PM] dimxy#2587
Hi, thank you for this.
Seems there is some extra check on the rpc-level that prevents running tokenorders without tokenid. I need to fix this

Next step for me is to add an image to the token.  I have the method, but haven't had the time.
I had a question about the ability to, in Komodo, to do this.  
Not quite sure if it is exactly what was desired as we didn't have much time to discuss the problem.
@barv, @bartwr , this question came from KB.  I'm not quite sure if this is exactly what he was after but maybe you could confirm?  It might be one part of what he would like.

[19-Oct-19 11:55 PM] CrisF#3405
@Regnar, I'm working with chains in KMDLabs so it is good that you are working on `RICK`.  I'm not sure if the Labs chains are up to date with the latest FSM.  Maybe @blackjok3r  could  confirm the status?

[19-Oct-19 11:56 PM] Regnar#6164
