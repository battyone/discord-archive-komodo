[03-Nov-19 07:12 PM] Regnar#6164
Also I'm unsure of this, but does token swapping actually mean token for token, or can you also do KMD for tokens?

[03-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Regnar#6164
oh I think I got it `The tokenbid method posts a public bid order. To fill the order, the parent chain's coin must be used.`

[03-Nov-19 07:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I haven't tried those ask/bid command yet

[03-Nov-19 07:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if you're on windows 10 may be you can try to run komodo under Windows Subsystem for Linux ?

[03-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea maybe. I have a raspberry pi I've been meaning to convert to 64 bit to run Komodod on. Maybe it's time I finally do that

[03-Nov-19 07:28 PM] CrisF#3405
@Regnar very cool! üöÄ

[03-Nov-19 07:31 PM] CrisF#3405
The token marketplace is for token swapping only I believe.

[03-Nov-19 07:33 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm a bit new to programming, still getting a grasp on git and working on actual projects instead of simple scripts. But I'll see if I can get the dev branch

[03-Nov-19 07:35 PM] CrisF#3405
`git checkout dev` then build. `git log -1` will show branch.

[03-Nov-19 07:36 PM] CrisF#3405
To get tokens back to coins I believe that `Gateways` is needed.  The next logical Module to make a demo GUI for?

[03-Nov-19 07:39 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I think people are going to want to price in a single unit of account, of which KMD would be ideal

[03-Nov-19 07:39 PM] Regnar#6164
Obviously tokens to tokens is also important, just think KMD deserves to get some love too.

[03-Nov-19 07:40 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea gateways for KMD to KMDT, token DEX to swap KMDT, and withdraw as KMD

[03-Nov-19 07:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, we'll be able to tokenize kmd for the token market.

[03-Nov-19 07:42 PM] CrisF#3405
I thought @TonyL had a TUI/gui for Gateways already.  Couldn't find it, but found his `Channels` GUI here `https://github.com/tonymorony/ChannelsCC-GUI`

[03-Nov-19 07:42 PM] CrisF#3405
That's another good one to add to the mix.

[03-Nov-19 07:43 PM] CrisF#3405
What do you think, get the marketplace up first?

[03-Nov-19 07:44 PM] CrisF#3405
(`Dice` GUI `https://github.com/tonymorony/DiceCC-GUI`)

[03-Nov-19 07:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, got them.  @Regnar Many TUIs in here `https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python`

Hope that is helpful.

Thanks TonyL üôá

I made a Trello for `Assets`.  Please join, add and modify as needed.  

If it seems useful it can be used as a template for other Modules.

Wow Tony is killing it

[03-Nov-19 08:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah!  Now he's so busy with AtomicDEX.  Miss him, haha.

[03-Nov-19 08:36 PM] CrisF#3405
His `Prices` project is very interesting.

[03-Nov-19 08:38 PM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully we can get this frontend kind of thing sorted out and give him and the other Devs the chance to concentrate on the bigger picture.

[03-Nov-19 08:42 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I'm almost exclusively python, so front end stuff for me is pretty basic but that's all a proof of concept is anyway

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, built something cool using Assets CC (Tokens) and want to put it here, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible

[03-Nov-19 10:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Nice.

[03-Nov-19 10:26 PM] Regnar#6164
Got a full list but I figured a lot of the people working on a single CC are checking the CC general channel

[03-Nov-19 10:26 PM] CrisF#3405
PHMA's weren't NFTs I think.

[03-Nov-19 10:26 PM] Regnar#6164
ah, yea you're right. I'll fix that on the next commit, hopefully I can add a bunch more at the same time

Hi @johnwhitestar üëã
We have started to put together some reference GUIs for Antara Modules.  Very early stages.
PHBA2061 has made a Pokemon token ‚òù and Regnar has added a lot of info to the resources document that is waiting on the PR to be accepted.
There also now a Trello board for Tokens/Assets here:  https://trello.com/b/tpEsu2j1/module-assets
Please add to it if you can.

Would like to get working on Gateways after Assets.  Any input would be appreciated!

[04-Nov-19 02:08 AM] Regnar#6164
started messing with some HTML to make it prettier. Kinda procrastinating on getting the `tokenorders` working with the dev branch

[04-Nov-19 02:30 AM] CrisF#3405
That looks good :)
What is the first thing you need to do with the `tokenorders`?

[04-Nov-19 02:33 AM] Regnar#6164
Honestly I can probably write what I need just from the docs, seeing the response from tokenorders. But I won't be able to test that it displays right in html

[04-Nov-19 02:40 AM] CrisF#3405
The docs for tokens and assets is quite complete.  Gateways, too.

[04-Nov-19 02:40 AM] CrisF#3405
(That's how I managed to test it, haha.)

[04-Nov-19 02:55 AM] Regnar#6164

you'll learn a lot out of this curiosity and hit and try

[06-Nov-19 03:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the next project you will do after leaning this will be much greater

[06-Nov-19 03:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm just happy that someone feels the need of GUI and actually trying to fill that space with whatever they got.
we can't have enough GUI devs 
the more the better
and CC showcase in GUI is much needed

[06-Nov-19 03:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm just busy with current project for probably next 2-3 weeks.
then I'll start my contribution on CC GUIs in Node.js + jQuery based work.

[06-Nov-19 03:16 AM] Regnar#6164
I don't mind GUI in python, which I've gotten pretty used to since I know a bit of it. the HTML stuff is a bit different but is important especially for localhost run browser apps

[06-Nov-19 03:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll suggest you to start taking bits and peaces from bootstrap website and make the HTML layout

[06-Nov-19 03:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[06-Nov-19 03:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's been amazing work.

[06-Nov-19 03:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ü§î we should have some list of 3rd party GUIs for Komodo Platform stuff ü§î

[06-Nov-19 03:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can you please push such list and updates to my awesomekmd git repo?

[06-Nov-19 03:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
http://awesomekmd.com/

[06-Nov-19 03:18 AM] Regnar#6164
I figured since most are just proof of concepts, and not really full functioning GUIs, it was better to just show them in the proof of concept list

[06-Nov-19 03:18 AM] Regnar#6164
especially if it's showing CC capabilities

[06-Nov-19 03:19 AM] Regnar#6164
like the pokedex, which is awesome

[06-Nov-19 03:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at this moment, PoC GUIs are much needed and important.

[06-Nov-19 03:19 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm going to PM you something, a bit long and out of place for here

[06-Nov-19 03:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
whatever GUIs we can get is better than having nothing

[06-Nov-19 03:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I rember the CLI days of SuperNET and end users complaining of no GUIs so no development/prodctive work by James ü§¶

[06-Nov-19 03:26 AM] Regnar#6164
I mean, a lot of people do see GUI work as "tangible" or something.

[06-Nov-19 03:26 AM] Regnar#6164
because they can SEE it and they imagine users and businesses using it to click buttons and boom blockchain stuff happens

[06-Nov-19 03:42 AM] CrisF#3405
That would be great if you could help out with GUI whenever you have the chance @grewalsatinder !

[06-Nov-19 03:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@CrisF would love to mate. in 2-3 weeks max. I'll be on to CC GUIs üôÇ

I have a TokensCC github bot I will put up on Github and on AwesomeKMD when it's done. Got quite a few bugs to work out though

[07-Nov-19 06:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Revamping CC tests to add into CI process, found a little inconsistency for asks/bids cancellation (latest FSM). 
The case is:
Creating bid and ask from node A. Then cancelling it from node B (which don't have "permission" to cancel it obv).
In case with tokenbidcancel generating transaction which rejecting on the broadcast, in case of tokenaskcancel I'm getting error right on tx generation stage. Example can be found below:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/XQ6FD7VqMn/
@dimxy can we generate error on tx generation stage in both cases?

[07-Nov-19 07:16 AM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL Are you suggesting that in your test case tokencancelbid should generate an error (before the tx is sent), like tokencancelask?
