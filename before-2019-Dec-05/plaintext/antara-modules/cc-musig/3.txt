maybe I need to jkust try 3 nodes manually

[23-Feb-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
all MUSIG need all commitments to generate a nonce

[23-Feb-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and all MUSIG need all nonces

[23-Feb-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well its not working tha way

[23-Feb-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it taking its own comitment

[23-Feb-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and as soona s you add on

[23-Feb-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it returns a nonce

[23-Feb-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my code shouldnt have changed anything there

[23-Feb-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
well I assumed it returned an error if there werent enough commitments to return a nonce

[23-Feb-19 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no it doesnt...

[23-Feb-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe manually is the next step to do?

[23-Feb-19 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or well to be mroe specific, it just doenst check they are all there, and just returns one as soon as you combine 2 commitments

[23-Feb-19 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then when you try to add more, it seemingly ignores them. They are added, but I dont think they are being used

[23-Feb-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I tguess I will need to try with 3 nodes without my changes, unless I can figure this out.

[23-Feb-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it will act the same way.

[23-Feb-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got it working

[23-Feb-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what was the trick?

[23-Feb-19 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( ind != MUSIG[myind]->num-1 )
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "ind.%i MUSIG[myind]->num.%i\n", ind, MUSIG[myind]->num);
            return(cclib_error(result,"need rest of nonce's to continue"));
        }```
Put this on every step

[23-Feb-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats really not going to be a solution for actual seperate nodes though maybe? Because I am doing everyhting in an exact order its easier to control

[23-Feb-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
for separate nodes, the way I had it should work

[23-Feb-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the issues are having multiple session data structurs

[23-Feb-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not so sure, I will test that at a later time. The problem is that its returning that nonce as soon as you call `commit` the veryt first time. So it wroks fine for only 2 nodes, but going any higher thatn that it breaks, and returns a nonce before ti has all the commitments.

[23-Feb-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe we need to track how many commitments it has and only ask for nonce after it has all of them?

[23-Feb-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if it only works for 2 pubkeys, its pretty worthless

[23-Feb-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. I will have a think about this, its getting late but I want to get a spend with large number working. gald I figured this out today. üòÉ

will try 100 now

[23-Feb-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
100 could well be a world record as far as I know

another world record haha

[23-Feb-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no reason even 5000 would not work

[23-Feb-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
10000 not sure where it would start to break, have to monitor ram use here.

[23-Feb-19 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
5000 is using 3GB of ram

[23-Feb-19 04:30 PM] gcharang#6833
now on each signing node, a session needs to be created:
 5 args: ind, numsigners, combined_pk, pkhash, message to be signed
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG cclib session 18 '[]' -- for this command, the values : 
```
 numsigners, combined_pk, pkhash, message to be signed
```
same on both nodes or different?

[23-Feb-19 04:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r ^

[23-Feb-19 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
index increments with pubkey the rest are the same.

[23-Feb-19 04:33 PM] gcharang#6833
The example you submitted here: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/145d05a62586760e74c3d3422c104107c583510f/src/cc/musig.cpp#L86
used different values, so I was a little confused

like how I did the single node here is it generate a list of pubkeys, and the index for each pubkey is the number the pubkey is in the list
Prety sure that example is wrong sorry

[23-Feb-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my terminal was a mess of commands. Must have copy pasted the wrong one

[23-Feb-19 04:35 PM] gcharang#6833
No problem. I saw jl's example from yesterday so was able to recognise this lol

[23-Feb-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wow 5000 is taking a long time, I hope it doesnt run out fo ram here üòÖ  4.5GB now

[23-Feb-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we need to post the pubkeys being combined to prove it is 5000 combined as it wont appear onchain

[23-Feb-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so some webpage that proves this world record and we can get some PR

[23-Feb-19 05:05 PM] Mylo#8306

[23-Feb-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just one sig 64 bytes

[23-Feb-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
5000 partial sigs of 32 bytes each

[23-Feb-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a list.json with all the keys. and the combined .. but I dont know if 5000 is going to finish, its extremly slow.

[23-Feb-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
5000 pubkeys

[23-Feb-19 05:06 PM] gcharang#6833

both nodes gave same `combinedsigs` and `verify` gave success on both nodes, but:

You can use that before I set it up too much, still waiting for /29 - so you can use that for a few days then I nuke it??

sure, its getting late, but just to install komodo and start the script. I need to see hwo much ram 5000 uses (hopefully its not more than 9GB)  then we can use your server to do the largest possible.

@blackjok3r I thought I need two nodes to test musig

[24-Feb-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The jl777 repo needs 2 nodes (and currentl tdoes nto work with more than 2)

[24-Feb-19 07:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I can just do getnewaddress and use it's pubkey to test musig?
