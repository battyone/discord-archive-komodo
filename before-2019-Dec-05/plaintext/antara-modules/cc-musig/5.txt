[24-Feb-19 12:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
```notice how small the tx is! 289 bytes as it is sent to the destpubtxid, which in turn contains the handle, pub33 and bigpub. the handle is used for error check, pub33 is used to make the destination CC address, so the normal CC signing needs to be passed in addition to the spend restrictions for dilithium.```

keypair without any params shows the big pubkey

[24-Feb-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
pub33 is your -pubkey= parameter if you didnt specify an external or "rand" privkey

[24-Feb-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
handle is not shown, it is used for an error check so you need to track it externally

[24-Feb-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
@CHMEX I pushed a hardforking update that supports dilithium validation. i had things configured to be more strict (instead of less strict), so as soon as someone broadcasts a valid dilithium spend, it will fork the chain. jl777 branch

Is quantum resistant transactions archieved with musig by forking chain on every transaction?

[25-Feb-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its a diffrent signing.. musig and the quantum resitant are diffrent CC's

[25-Feb-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
musig just allows very large amounts of signers to multi sig. I did 1000 pubkey spend already a few days ago

[25-Feb-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo  start a 5500 pubkey one, but maybe it was too many even for a 64GB of ram machine.

[25-Feb-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will need to launch a new chain with it

[25-Feb-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not even going to try merging that... too hard

[25-Feb-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
dilithium forked the chain

[25-Feb-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if you merge in just the dilithium parts and not the musig.cpp, most all should just work. i think one function was renamed and moved for parsing args

[25-Feb-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I might be able to do what I just did to mrege the rogue fix, and just copy the musig.cpp on top of it... buit not sure

[25-Feb-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its easier jiust to amke a new chain.... looks like its NxN the more keys you do

[25-Feb-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like 1000 is nothing but 5000 is too many even for 64gb ram server

[25-Feb-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a PRE to make for staker fixes also which wasn what I was going to do next that could take a fair while

[25-Feb-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the session call has a parameter that is pointer to memory scratchpad, but they dont describe how much RAM is needed. it crashed when I send in a scratchpad pointer, so i just use null. they say that uses an inefficient memory allocation. to get really high numbers probably that needs to be changed

just do a diff of musig.cpp from my branch to yours, it should just mostly be your changes

[25-Feb-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i couldnt have made that many changes to musig.cpp in a few days

[25-Feb-19 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it merged the other way horribly... I just copied your entire file ontop of it to remove my changes... will look at it in a minute

[25-Feb-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a PR of your changes to jl777 is a good idea? that way people can use the scripts to do large combined pubkeys using the main MUSIG chain

[25-Feb-19 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it doesnt break the existing stuff sure can do

[25-Feb-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to change the RPC calls thats all

[25-Feb-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
add myind to the 3 relavent calls

[25-Feb-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it can just be the last parameter and default to myind if not there

[25-Feb-19 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm I did it as param 1, shouldnt be too ahrd to change to last.

[25-Feb-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
in general, optional params should be the last

[25-Feb-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
was only concerned with making it work as fast as possible the other day. wasnt done anywhere near close to properly

[25-Feb-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[25-Feb-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is the best way. first iteration is fast and dirty
