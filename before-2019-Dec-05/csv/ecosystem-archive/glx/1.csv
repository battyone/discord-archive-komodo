We are exploring potential options because the alt coin market is in the toilet and I mentioned in my article does each platform really need their own token when making simple payments such as monthly subscription fees can be done using BTC, ETH, etc.  We are certainly not trying to launch a colored coin on the BTC network.  We are a US based company and have other options for raising capital to continue to build our network.  As I mentioned in my article the biggest threat is SEC intervention which can shut a startup down completely.  That certainly will not help me get the company where I know it can go.  I am also not sure that anyone here besides @Cryptoon and @siu - Chainmakers knows much about the GLX.com network or what I am trying to build.  I invite you to log in there and connect with me to chat directly.";"";"";
