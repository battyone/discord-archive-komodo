I would like to get their confirmation in writing.  Conceivably a possible scenario exists.  If a member requests a barter exchange to issue his credit in the form of a voucher, and that member sells that credit.  Is the merchant a seller of prepaid access,  is the exchange a provider of prepaid access.  Credit by definition is not prepaid  .  However the merchant is  selling that credit.  Is the merchant independently liable for sales of gift vouchers or does the exchange ,  which serves as a third party record keeper only, and issues said vouchers to the merchants at the merchants request,  held liable as well.  Existing barter networks use this mechanism to deal with non businesses , so I think it's ok but then again from what I've seen of their operations,  they may not be up to date on rules that have changed in the past couple years or so.";"";"";

Rent to be based off percentage of miners occupying the site .  So if I have 50% of the miners I pay 1500 a month for rent.   Currently warehouse is being fixed up and we are starting to get the two main components ready,  electrical and airflow/ventilation.   In a couple weeks exterior repairs will be done then we will bust out the the fans and electrical.  Move in date set for September 1st.  Maybe in a little bit before hand .  Also have deal worked out so that from my estimated electric consumption and rent will be paid for some months in advance.    Going to announce collateralized  private loan request to team soon.  Have over 1MH already however would like to fill the space up more ,   Not to mention I think I can return their investment quickly with funds being spent all on miners and accessories and my other miners contributing to the payback.";"";"üëç (12),üòõ (2)";

"406179072922746882";"polycryptoblog#1173";"17-Sep-18 06:24 AM";"In short yes.  In a barter exchange goods and services are liquidity,  cryptocoins are just another good,  and it acts as like a tether without being a coin. The main value proposition of a barter exchange is as a credit network,  allowing small/new businesses and consumers to obtain a line of credit proportional to the demand for their goods and services as well as an exclusive channel for new customers.  For large companies and established businesses it provides a way of taking advantage of excess inventory and lulls in the workflow to pay for outofband essentials.  Since this is a credit network,  the creditworthiness of the participants has to be vetted or otherwise assured through collateral to provide a foundational surety of contract and minimum line of credit.  Komodo will have a preferred treatment of course as collateral,  with other self-generating coins accepted as well at a less favorable rate.  With this a feedback loop occurs:   Collateral generates coins which covers costs and provides goods to barter with.  Coins get exchanged for trade credit which then is used to get more self-generating coins (Komodo).     Regarding the credit generating process it is important to note that it is the participants of the network that generate the credit not the barter exchange itself,  the barter exchange is just the record keeper.   The power of issuance of credit is in the hands of the people.";"";"";
