"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"23-Oct-18 09:40 AM";"on the autocancel part atm, I'm handling the cases where the amount is not valid, where the amount is exactly the good one, where the amount is done via multiple tx, for example if the user just sends twice, each time the ordercancel is triggered, if there is a tx to refund, it will increase the sum refunded

If we have the case for example of a user sending double tx, and the 1st is validated and processed for a refund while the  2nd is still not confirmed, the parser will see it and see that a refund of the first part have already been sent, so the next time it will launch a refund, it will deduct the first refund tx";"";"";

"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"23-Oct-18 11:49 AM";"the same rule applies on the other side : a user that has been refunded can just say : Ok, refund is done, stop trying to find hypothetical funds, when both have either been refunded or in case of no refund (for the side that didn't send anything).

 The refund logic stops when those conditions apply : trade done // one side refunded the other side said he won t need a refund // both refunded // in case one side is refunded and the other just let the trade die, the refunding search only lasts 2 days";"";"";
