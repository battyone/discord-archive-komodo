It affects how funds , via addresses, must be distributed across servers, to allow scaling for Z.
(of course mixmatch of servers are possible, a server can be eligible for Z only, or serve both and be included i the randomization process)
As it s currently designed : T stays on coinserver classic, or on any available T server, if it s a z, same : Generate the address on any avail Z server 

The only edge case is that if one side want to be paid in Z, and the other side pays in T. That would have needed an additional process, but not anymore as the server choosing catch this case and gen the T address for the dst on a Z server, allowing to direclty sending back to the src his share";"";"";
