Objective is to have cancellation and detailled status done for wednesday eve / thursday. 
Will then begin drawing the global PP server automation scripts. But as everything is already handled via params and well distinct status codes it won t take long. 
The last step will be to do the same on coinservers, but here again as everything uses params the only point that can take a little bit of time will be the ""round robin"" stuff on Z servers.

"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"15-Nov-18 03:34 PM";"Ok... little and huge update here....

Managed to get the logic working for send part and handling exceptions. Cancel was done pretty fast thanks to the x rewrites of other stuff to handle every single case... on serverside it all is contained in 4 scripts. And 4 on CoinServers.

Automatic mode worked with manual sending (launching script) on coinservers... so now it will just be to find the smartest way to scan through coins and launch sending...

This means I m nearly ready to be plugged to the gui. Few more tests but the main first rush is behind me.

Next objectives : finish a basic version of automation on coinservers and after it works refine both automation scripts.

Futures improvements will likely be bugfix and optims(for example as every Coinserver interoperate with PPserver via SSH, reducing the calls to the max and using a different method would speed up things even more. Had an idea about it that will coincide with external tools / value I want to be available : servercoin availability and such. Grouping calls will remove most of slow stuff.
I ll also have to rewrite every single part using latest things I discovered and learned.";"";"";
