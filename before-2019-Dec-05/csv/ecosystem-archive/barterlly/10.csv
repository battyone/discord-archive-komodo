It now will take information for each coin on different servers, this will be done via a params table that will know which user/host the command need to execute remotely the requests, for some this will be done via RPC(mostly eth)
This will allow to add any number of coin as it is now possible to spread them across multiple servers.";"";"";

With current ""tech"", we can't say it's KMD ""powered"", but if this project is successful and people like the concept maybe in the future there will be a possibility to use different method and get rid of infrastructure, or the project may also go on a totally different way and just develop an exchange feature";"";"";
