For the behaviour, the :""I want to pay in Z"" will only be a checkbox that will activate a db flag to let scripts know they have to gen a Z, no ui work, just the checkbox.
the : ""I want to be paid in Z"" will have just a slight modification : src_deal must be checked accordingly, as the receiving address won't be a T anymore";"";"👍 (1)";
