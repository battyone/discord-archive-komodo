"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"28-Nov-18 02:35 PM";"so, I decided last night to change how I handle sending, cause it currently requires some calls that are very slow, like executing a script on the coinserver to get status + executing remotely scripts that will generate every single bit of needed info to put the params in files to get it automatically processed independently by the coinserver";"";"";
"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"28-Nov-18 02:36 PM";"the limitation about this is pretty simple : 

Imagine we got a version very fast of the backend that runs, let s say we re on status 6 : All green, trade will happen,  On status 6 it will basically send the raw info to the specified and chosen coinserver to just give him the info about the TX we need to send";"";"";

"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"28-Nov-18 02:38 PM";"that mean we would for example stay stuck on status 7 : src has been sent to the server that will process it, but dst failed.";"";"";

"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"28-Nov-18 02:38 PM";"so I decided to replace the calls that create the files on Coinserver by a DB version";"";"";
