**Summary of what's planned**

*MGN is a PIVX fork and by default BIP65 is not activated.  This would have to be added for MGNX to be atomic swap capable and therefore compatible for the BarterDEX

*Create the front end for the colored token DEX on MGNX. Add some reward programs that incentivize people to start creating tokens for attracting liquidity. 

*Offchain governance system that incorporates both Magna and MagnaX. The reasoning for offchain over onchain is justified in the whitepaper, which should be released by the end of month.  After implementation, we would go 1 layer deeper and start integrating colored tokens to the mix, by giving them their own governance.";"";"";
