Libra seems to be interesting it has a new programming lang called move for its smart contracts its open source and test net there is two coins on it 1k transactions per secs, 10sec finality times (confirmations i am assuming), there is no blocks on this chain different to a traditional blockchain, also no KYC on the protocol, however the dapps built on it may have, it has gas fees/transaction fees, not backed by USD but multiple currencies in a ""basket of currencies"". you make coins by depositing fiat and are burned when you withdraw. (stable coin?) calibra wallet works on facebook messenger whatsapp insta etc might add other crypto in future. based in Switzerland as a non profit, there are 28 members in the association (the companies mentioned yesterday) the target is 100 to start before hitting public, facebook at the moment  has 1% of the vote to control the network.  if you want to join the group you have to pay 10 million USD along side other requirements. only a 30% of the members can be blockchain related companies to stop them commandeering it and allow the more customer facing companies to have a say, it sounds fair so far, . there is the investment token for governance the guys who run it and the libra coin for use like a normal currency (similar to makerDOW crypto)";"";"";

1 - it will introduce the global masses to ""cryptocurrency"" and open the door for other projects to gain exposure
2 - it will allow FB to become a payment processing platform in ways that not many people cant imagine. and while this will take years i forsee FB as being THE leader taking away market share from other payment processors like PYPL etc and building an ecosystem on par with AAPL";"";"";
