We are still at it working on creating a better future for all in terms of housing. We need your help. We are accepting any donations of KMD from members of the community to assist us with things like server bills, construction materials etc as this has fallen on my shoulders. I would like thank @peddycb for suggesting it. IF you could donate to help further this project, it would be forever appreciated.

Our KMD address is RRYE4LvFP9HL94ew8RpMqpUQCQJ4utCvMD

Thank you all for your support in what we are doing. I am trying really hard to get this moving as fast as I can. Thank you once again.";"";"";
