It makes no sense, though, as the exchange itself is always in the top 45 for volume. It would be killing the golden goose to cheat us. At this time, I'm certain barterdex is ok, if difficult to use. I'm not ready to endorse Exrates. Nor am I ready to call shenanigans, it could be innocent. We're looking into it. We did do quite a bit of research, and all that came up, really, was slow withdrawals. That's an annoyance more than a red flag.
