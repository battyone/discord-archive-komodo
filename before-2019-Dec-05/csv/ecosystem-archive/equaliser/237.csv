If you are not currently in sync with the block explorer, do not make ANY transactions, as they will end up being reversed. The main chain has resolved the fork, but there is some work to be done to get your wallet properly in sync, and any transactions on the fork will be lost. (not the coins, the transactions). As soon as we are certain of the fix, I will post it up here and in announcements. We have been working hard on this in the background, and consulting with the Komodo team as well.  If you are up to date with the explorers, all is well. If not, hang loose, help is on the way.";"";"";
