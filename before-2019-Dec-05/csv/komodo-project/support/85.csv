1. I have both ZEX and ZEXO in my agama wallet fully synced.
2. I used import WIF key (private key) in ZEXO wallet
3. I can now see the ZEX address in my ZEXO wallet.
4. I have done a rescan of the wallet.

The problem is that ZEXO wallet is not showing any balance. Correct balance is being shown when I switch over to my old ZEX wallet.
I have tried to close down the agama wallet and restart it without any success.

Any suggest how to solve this issue?";"";"";
