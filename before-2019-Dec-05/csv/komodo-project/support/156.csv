AND, before any of this security issue with the Agama wallet was discovered, my version of Agama was bugged, (I think I had shut it down incorrectly, and corrupted the blockchain) but I wasn't worried, because I have all of my private keys safely stored.  Basically, it only worked in lite mode, because I think my local blockchain had been corrupted, and it would not sync.  Just stalls out at Activating Best Chain.

Now I'm running into a tonne of issues getting my Agama wallet started up, just to see if I am one of the unlucky people to have had my KMD scooped out of my wallet.

When I start Agama in light mode, my balance is there, but the wallet is not synced, and I can't send the KMD .""Error Unable to get transactions history data. Code ApiElectrumTransactions"".  I am running Agama v 0.3.4.

Any ideas about how I can resolve this?";"";"";
