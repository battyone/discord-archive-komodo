Why address reuse is discouraged:

Reduced security: An unused address is protected by ECDSA AND several SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 operations, but only ECDSA after being used because the public key must be revealed during spending. This has been shown to open up several possible attacks in the past.[1]

Reduced privacy: All participants who you give the address to know it is yours obviously. They can use this information to analyze incoming and outgoing transactions to identify other addresses you own and who you are interacting with, not to mention how much bitcoin you have. This can be serious for businesses in competition or in situations where a payment might might put someone into harms way (politically unpopular donations or as a means for extortion, etc).
