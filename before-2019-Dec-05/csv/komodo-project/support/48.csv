I created my wallet yesterday, after a few hours and several entries in my wallet, all entering through the password and not typing my seed, I sent some komodos to the address that appeared in my portfolio, being verified letter by letter.

During the night I got into my wallet again and found that I had no more funds in it, and the address on it at that time was different from the address that had sent the funds.

The support answered this;

Hi Aislan Monteiro,

If you just created the wallet today as your first stated please make sure that the actual address that was being generated at the beginning with your seed is the same. There is a possibility that you created a pin file based on a mismatch of your previous correct seed and then you pinned this new address without verifying that it was the address that was used to send the funds in your exchange.

If you wrote down your 24 word seed please make sure to type it word by word correctly and please follow the guide to see if you are able to test the scenario that is explained in this cases.";"";"";
