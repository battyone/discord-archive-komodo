That's your Key. Keep it safe, its the only way  to get to your funds. Copy the address, log out, then log  back in to make sure you see the exact same address, then you know you retyped (or pasted) the correct seed. You should send 1 kmd to the wallet first to make sure you can access it again. If you see the kmd you sent, then you should be good.";"";"";

But still you could encrypt your wallet with a password in a separate folder or cold storage if needed each time you do an important transaction.";"";"";
