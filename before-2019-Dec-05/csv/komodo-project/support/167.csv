The wallet then sits in ""Synchronizing with network..."" until I shut it down.  It has been in that state for 4 hours now.

The pinned message does not specify if the block that was invalidated is what is supposed to be reconsidered, so I tried both.

If  Keccak is only used as a mining alg, it doesn't matter, we have integrated many different coins with different minig algos. If Keccak is also used for transaction signing, we will run into this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/462 (SMART is also using Keccak)
If so, we will need to wait till this is fixed/added to mm2, which will happen for sure.";"";"";
