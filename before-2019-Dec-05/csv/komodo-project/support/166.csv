check what block you are in. use getinfo
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use getblockhash 1444008
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH> without <> like the command below
once that is done, use reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2";"";"";

After verifications, i remembered that i created a new address from the recommendations here https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement right after i read an article about the problem. I installed Agama-Windows-v0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview, created a new seed, PIN and password, i then moved 159 KMD to the new address (RRFgArgcHaBFwKqYFdh1hifuUvGjCQPBJo). I'm sure i did it right, but now when i enter the seed, the address it gaves me is RErMuJnN3Ccphj5366tyPPHR4x7XXnoJg2 and i can't find the 159 KMD i had (it seems to be on the RRFgArgcHaBFwKqYFdh1hifuUvGjCQPBJo on which it seems i have no control over it) .
