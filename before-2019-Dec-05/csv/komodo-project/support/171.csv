I am not sure what the problem is
you can try using the KomodoOcean wallet
https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4
https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet-on-windows

you should be able to use the KomodoOcean wallet directly without moving any files around as you previously used the Agama wallet

and ping me if you need more help";"";"";
