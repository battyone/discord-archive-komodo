The encrypt+password option is a quality of life feature where agama stores your seed in a text file and encrypts it with your password. Now you don't have to type/copy-paste seed everytime. Because typos when typing the seed will generate different addresses and user may not notice and lose funds. If your encrypt password is weak and an attacker got access to your seed file(created by agama and encryped), he can brute force your seed file by trying passwords again and again until one works.";"";"";
