Happy to do so. 

Can you please show me where specifically the error in the docs is found, and give me a general idea of what needs to change?

For example, do we need to say that users should download the Zcash params separately? Or will the pre-built binaries invite the user to download the params, and they must click 'yes'? etc.";"";"";

@SergeF, I don't know how you can claim to download an old version of the Hush wallet on the 23/4/19. I made the suggestion to the Hush team to remove all links to all old Hush files on the 20th so as not to confuse those that are newbies. 

If you check the Hush github repository, the website had been updated almost straight away. 

You also failed to read the ""News"" page on the Myhush website that was very clear what was going to happen regarding Hush > Hush3 upgrade. This was posted months prior to the upgrade.

As for your claims that nothing was on the ""main"" page of the Hush website. Please scroll to the section on their website labelled ""News"" or click on the red ""News"" link at the top menu. 

Any mining that you did after the snapshot at block 500,000 was a failure on your part of doing your research and a failure of your own due diligence. 

It was clear that the Sapling upgrade will mean public Hush addresses will start with an R. 

If you somehow incorrectly downloaded an old version of the Hush swing wallet and generated a t1 address and mined to it using the old Hush blockchain after all the information provided, then that mistake was on your part unfortunately.";"";"";
