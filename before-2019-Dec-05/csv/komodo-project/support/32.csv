In my experience the support and patience shown by everyone here has been very amazing!
There are times when I didn't understand the answers and when I couldn't get things working, but that was a function of my own lack of basic knowledge (I'm starting from 0).
By investing time in research and building of experience I've moved past those difficulties and move on to newer ones while gaining a bit more of an understanding.
Very grateful to you guys for all the help!";"";"üëç (6)";
