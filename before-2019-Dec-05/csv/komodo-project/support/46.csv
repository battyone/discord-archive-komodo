"414128958326571008";"Hermes#6934";"19-Oct-18 10:47 PM";"Both wallets are equally safe , it depends on which one fits you better, if you want a fast approach entering your wallet will recommend Lite mode it doesn't need to load the complete blockchain but still I think every user should always read the precautions of this mode. For instance before sending any type of transaction to the wallet the best practice is to get a pin password for the wallet and most importantly save your seed and verify you wrote it right by entering the wallet with it at least 3 times and finally but not least important saving your private key generated for your specific address depeding on the coin you are using. Here is a good start to learn more about how Agama Lite mode and Native work.

"414128958326571008";"Hermes#6934";"19-Oct-18 10:52 PM";"I am not suggesting that one is safer than the other because in native mode you have all of your private keys stored in your computer and as long as your computer is working and have your files intact you won't loose your funds an even though if that happen you can always save your private keys of the addresses that hold your assets as back up or the wallet.dat file . The only way  that it could problematic for native or  lite mode  is if your computer or  enviorment gets compromised  ... so is a matter of choosing what fits you best at the end";"";"";
