In both machines the Agama SPV had not been able to connect to the SPV server for about a week now. When trying to switch servers in settings nothing seems to happen on the desktop, but the surface tablet will come up with a red box in the lower right hand corner saying ‚Äútcp is unreachable‚Äù. This may be unrelated but at about the same time Agama native on the desktop will reach about 98% then stall there. I tried 2.39 and 2.4 on both machines. The desktop has AVG (I did put in exceptions) and the Surface tablet only has what came with windows (no off the shelf anti-virus).
