I have setup a barterDEX instance following the instructions at github as best as possible, though there seems to be several different/similar sets intertwined. I have imported and exported assets and seeds, saved a local coins database, can find and trade into open orders, have broken coin piles of all assets using the inventory tool, even tried using Hyperdex. However every single order that i place fails or is cancelled when the computer sleeps (usually much longer than 4hours).
I have run all the code applicable to Win-64 from this page including installing the prerequisites.

But now it cannot launch, it is stucked on the loading screen. For hours. I found the blogpost about mandatory komodo blockchain upgrade from Aug 27. I understand that this wallet was not updated for a year and that's why it cannot connect.

So I downloaded Agama wallet, setup a new KMD wallet. But, there is no option to import private key from my previous (mentioned) wallet. Yes, I've backed up my private keys.

How do I sweep my old wallet into Agama? What will happen to my interest that accumulated in the old wallet? When I check my address on KMD block explorer, there is only original amount without the interest.";"";"";
