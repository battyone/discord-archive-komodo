In normal financial transactions, if your bank says transaction is being processed and it is taking  a long time then that is a problem. But here you can verify that your address has the expected amount of funds in both your own agama wallet and in a block explorer which are the reliable sources of information. So whatever the Binance webpage shows, if you got your funds, you got your funds. Their servers might have been busy or buggy. As long as you only you control the private key of an address, only you own the funds in it, irrespective of binance website shows.

Regarding confirmations: It is the number of blocks that have been added on top of the block which had your transaction. Therefore the more confirmations your agama is showing, the more secure your funds have become. This is also not a problem with KMD(because of dPOW).  The number of confirmations in agama is increasung because that is how blockchains work.";"";"";
