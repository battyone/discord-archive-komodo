DeckerToday at 19:54
This night and possible tomorrow morning i will update all our KMD and assetchains explorers. So, plz don't report if you will see ""502"", it means - maintenance.
Update will be going ""step-by-step"", one chain after another, so no massive explorers outage planned.

"497498788731158529";"plazma#1625";"10-Dec-18 08:46 PM";"Question.    Suppose an organic software product for a business application costs $50,000 and its size is 40 KLOC. Determine the effort required to develop the software product at nominal development time. Assuming that the inhouse engineer cost $6000p/m, would it be more cost effective to buy this product or build it?

Solution.    cost of pre built software = $50,000
            
            Estimation of development effort
            
            Effort = 2.4 * (KLOC)^1.05 PM
                   
                   = 2.4 * (40)^1.05 PM
                   
                   = 2.4 * 48 PM
                   
                   = 115 PM
            
            Estimation of development time
            
            Nominal development time = 2.5 * (Effort)^0.38 Months
            
                                     = 2.5 * (115)^0.38 Months
                                     
                                     = 2.5 * 6 Months
                                     
                                     = 15 Months
            
            Cost required to develop the product = 15 * $6000
                                                 
                                                 = $90,000
            
            Conclusion
            
            Buy the damn software, or pay $40,000 extra....lol...:p(just joking in exam i won't write this conclusion....)";"";"";
