they try but fight battles they can't win. Forking the network every 6 months is beyond retarded. the only reason they do this is to protect their owm mining interests. They can't compete with ASICS. and xmr doesn't like competetion. XMR is highly centralized around developers. There is no funding so Certain parties with ( maybe not so nice ) interests will get to decide what develops.  (blockstream takeover).


XMR privacy is also really a joke compared to Zero proofs. XMR is just a mixer, and a very lousy one too. with only 11 mixins. Dash for example has a anonimity set of a few million.
