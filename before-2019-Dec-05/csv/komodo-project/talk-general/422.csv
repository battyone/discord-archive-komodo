Submitting stuff for update was done so many times. I don t see what s unprofessionnal about saying things that have to change. Tried so much in priv and nothing was done. The professionalism would be to handle git a very better way, giving the people and holders a way to decide for those type of decisions, stop doing things that just a minority vote for emselves. Being agile in so much subjects. It s easy to blame when you re into those conversations only from 3 monthes, it s harder to see that it needs monthes of warning to get people realize there is an issue.";"";"";

It's no excuse, but the system is the first of it's kind and there are no best practices to follow.

And though potential solutions may have been vocalised and discussed, just because NN consensus chose an alternative (after long and arduous conversation), does not excuse going nuclear. CG repeats his points ad nauseum, but manages to maintain a level of grudging acceptance and mirth when it goes another way. Your ""offer"" to sell nodes was repeated and there was no interest until it your consistent disgruntled disruption wore people down enough to capitulate so we could get on with work. You took your profits and then assumed a half month of ownership was due a full month of the mining, and in not getting your way I assume you resumed your disgruntled disruption.  Maybe I'm not privy to everything, but this is what I saw. As it was happening I expressed that your insights had merit, though I completely disagree with how you have acted, regardless of any emotional distress you have been experiencing from outside KMD. Though extreme emotional stress may explain actions, it does not excuse them. I told you to take a break and get some air, shit I even tipped you to get a massage while on holiday. Sometimes a step back can reveal a more effective route forward. In my experience, rash acts while under emotional duress tend to moke this worse, not better.";"";"";
