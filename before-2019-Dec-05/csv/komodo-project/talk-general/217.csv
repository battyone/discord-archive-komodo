This means that google will have your passphrase in their logs, which they (correctly) wouldnt be treating as having any high value. It could just be they have not much security at all as to who can access these logs. How many people work at google? how many can get access to google servers with unprotected logfiles via some means? I do not know if these logfiles even exist or if they are indeed unprotected, but then again I dont know that they dont. The point is that it is entirely possible due to this design flaw of coinimi wallet.
