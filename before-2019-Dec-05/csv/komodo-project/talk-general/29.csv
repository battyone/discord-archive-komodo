And i believe that ultimately, decentralized apps will rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains.
In short, there isn‚Äôt going to be one clear-cut ‚Äúwinning blockchain‚Äù you can select for decentralized app development. Instead,  i  believe that the best way to future-proof your investment is to take a blockchain-agnostic approach, building decentralized apps on a platform that lets you interact with any blockchain .i believe in this so firmly that komodo  platform this way: integrating with all blockchain networks, and giving you the flexibility to quickly build decentralized apps with whichever blockchain meets your needs.
When your app needs to interact with other blockchains, you already have the inbuilt capabilities to do so‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven in a competitive situation when you can‚Äôt be told which blockchain it is. And rather than forcing you to deal with all the different development languages, they  simplified smart contract creation so you can use natural language expressions to automatically generate code.
As your business‚Äô and industry‚Äôs use of blockchain and smart contracts evolves, you have the ability to quickly respond to changing conditions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhether creating new smart contracts, or interacting with entirely new blockchains.";"";"";
