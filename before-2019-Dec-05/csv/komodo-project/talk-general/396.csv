you need to understand that all that conversation is 
at best a ruse to get folks to talk and then move on.

There's much better fits for what Ethereum needs 
than BCash, for example there's GoChain, specifically
solved all the issues that plague Ethereum so badly, 
Scalability, Speed, Fees, 100% ETH Compatibility to
enable any dApp or Smart Contract that runs on ETH
to run without modification on GoChain (GO). It even 
has full address compatibility, one just has to select a 
GoChain node to see Balances & Tokens one has on the
same address than one uses for ETH & Tokens. Go figure.
Why would Ethereum not choose a perfect fit for their own
intermediate shortcoming in their transition phase to whatever?

Said that, there's even some OG UTXO blockchains 
that are a much better fit to that purpose than BCash, 
for example FLO, a metadata & DLR validating specialised 
project with 100% data integrity  &  uptime since 2013, 
on PoW with 40 seconds block time. Caltech, t0 & Medici 
are building on FLO currently with working live use-cases.

Vitalik names BCH, which is not really a fit for other reasons.
Who knows what's in his bag? 🙄";"";"";
