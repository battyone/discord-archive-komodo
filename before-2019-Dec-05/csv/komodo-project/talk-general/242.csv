You say even large chains will want VBK,  imagine there is a coin similar in price and marketcap and mining parameters as Komodo. About 2.6 million coins are mined per year. 26000 coins at 1% mining fee roughly 26k usd ,  this is 4-5x the cost of Komodo DPoW.  And only gets worse with more capitalized chains.  Lower end chains face the problems a) no way to recuperate shitcoin for btc spent b) low value coins being split up = tragedy of the commons";"";"";
