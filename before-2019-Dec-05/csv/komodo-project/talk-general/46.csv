There is a paradigm shift underway that sadly, very few recognize. And it's not about lambo's or wall street tomfuckery. It's about freedom. Freedom from the prying eyes of those who wish to control and freedom from usurious payment processors who think they deserve a cut of every transaction in the world. I know I'm preaching to the choir here but I feel like it bears clarification. KMD is at the TOP of the tech tree and has all the tools in place, or under development to usurp the status quo.
