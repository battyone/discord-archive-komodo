https://www.coindesk.com/researcher-discovers-serious-vulnerability-in-paper-crypto-wallet-website
Our recommendation is to use one of these:
```
- Verus Agama (https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview)
- KomodoOcean QT (https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/folders/29000055193)
- Ledger Hardware wallet (Make sure the Ledger seed hasn't been input in the unsahe versions of Agama)
