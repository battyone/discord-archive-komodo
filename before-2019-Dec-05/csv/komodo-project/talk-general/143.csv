Komodo community members can launch Beacons and inform each other about the project. 

It‚Äôs a more decentralised approach to networking and information distribution. We‚Äôre still in beta and the community drive within the Komodo ecosystem initially inspired me to start working on MintFlint. 

It would be cool to get your views so we can create a better experience for the Komodo community.";"";"ü§î (1),üëå (1)";
