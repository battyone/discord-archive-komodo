After struggling with the instructions and thinking I was an idiot because no server would work, I downloaded the Utrum wallet (thanks to @Deleted User ), entered my compromised seed, and my KMD was there. I immediately transferred to Ledger until this mess gets fixed. The servers being down adds to the complexity of the problem.

I'm beginning to think that wallets are almost as risky as storing on an exchange. The exception is hard wallets. The little dab of money I'm making from interest by keeping funds on different wallets is not worth the risk for me. Perhaps I'll gain more trust down road.";"";"";

Announcement, the Atomic Labs Ledger reward claim app is now free to use üéâ

In light of recent events we want to encourage more secure asset storage, so hopefully this can convince a few more people to move over to hardware wallets, and give the users who are now moving over an easy way to claim.

It‚Äôs totally free, we take no cut, try it out: https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

You have @hyperDEX  (Pondsea) mainly to thank for this. He funded me to develop it out of his own pocket and was hoping to make his money back with the fees. He‚Äôs nowhere near breaking even but has decided to remove the fees for the benefit of the community.";"";"";
