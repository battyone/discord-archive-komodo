not sure about the hate, I didnt see it. Did see price fall tho, could be delayed as we didnt fall alongside other alts earlier. 
@dukeleto is a fictional character in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. He is also the founder of HUSH, an elected notary node operator, and donated NN earnings to K64 earlier, which could be seen as supporting the ecosystem (though I think he's questioning the decision of that generosity). You'll have to ask him about the Verus Beef, I have no idea.
There's lots happening here. A new version of atomicDEX beta was just released, NSPV is being worked on, a new difficulty adjustment algo to mitigate block stranding from massive hash has been created, Antara composer is online,  the modules are being expanded, #kmdlabs is testing improvements to dPoW, and an API to source ecosystem coin stats is under development. There's more, but you'll have to check out some other channels.";"";"â™¥ (1)";
