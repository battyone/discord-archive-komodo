As you already know, Cryptocurrencies derive most of their value through the network of users that are actively using them. The images here clearly show that Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate the active user base, while EOS and TRON dominate the total number of transactions on their Blockchain. The reason EOS and TRON have so many transactions, is due to the dApps that their community is using, especially the gaming dApps which require a large amount of transactions. However, one very important element that most people don‚Äôt consider, is the security of the Blockchain. This can roughly be measured by how much it would cost a hacker  in processing power to hack the network. In this case, Bitcoin outshines every other Blockchain out there with a cost roughly around $506,116 per hour. And this is exactly why Bitcoin is considered the digital gold of this space. The global reserve crypto must have an impenetrable network, so that people around the world have confidence that it will always maintain its store of value.";"";"";

If elected, I will be continuing to support the Komodo ecosystem through the creation of a development fund. This fund will be initially used to help create a GUI for CHIPS. Following that, any KMD ecosystem projects will be able to apply for fund usage. I hope this gives projects a small, but much needed boost when the time is right. 
I believe in KMD, and am here to help this ecosystem grow. Please read my proposal at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/blob/master/notarynodes/nutellalicka/README.md";"";"";
