the total irony is that all of this is over shares that per node amount to less than I spend on 🚬 but somehow are ""undeserved"" by a hashrate that dwarfs any major farm
to that end I support abolishment, I was just pointing out that the hope for rewards are what keep many miners mining (even though most of them are unaware that they have almost no chance of getting them any more)
