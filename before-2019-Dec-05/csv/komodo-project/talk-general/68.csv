Been doing a lot of reading and competitive analysis to try and make a viable economic system .    It is a p2p system however the record keeper is the one who adjusts the account balances not the participants in the trade.   Example:  somebody wants to barter access to your password app.   They would contact the exchange who would broker the deal with you,  your account would be credited and their account debited.
