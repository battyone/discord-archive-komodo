That first footnote is a screenshot of the results NOW... I'd like to know if this had in fact been an active API request BEFORE, and at what point it started returning 400 codes? 
The 2nd footnote they cited saying they ""weren't process further by Google"" is NOT actually sourced, that is their current assumption with no verification from Google. The footnote reads ""¬≤ We have asked Google to confirm that bad requests‚Äô text body isn‚Äôt stored on their servers, we will update our statement accordingly.""
