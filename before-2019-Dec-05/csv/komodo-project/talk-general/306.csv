The speaking slots are not fitting because it's not about a specific brand or project but more crypto in general, experiences with crypto, how people got in, etc... like TED talks.    But there are also a few demo slots where you can let attendees install and use a blockchain app. Perhaps this will be a chance to demo BarterDEX or Pangea Poker to a totally new audience.";"";"";
