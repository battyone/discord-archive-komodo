 Ethereum has a lot of features that people find compelling. Let’s explore.Ethereum makes it possible to...
 
Run apps
Rather than pay a big company to run your app, Ethereum lets you host it on thousands of computers around the world.
    
Create magic swords
Well, digital ones anyway. Ethereum can be used to create digital items for video games that are tradeable outside of the game itself.
    
Pay for things
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency too. You can use it to pay for everything on the Ethereum network.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Create new cryptocurrencies
Ethereum lets developers create new cryptocurrencies, called tokens, that can be stored in app like Coinbase Wallet.
    
Code your money
Let’s say a charity wants to send money to a thousand people every day for a year. With Ethereum, it only takes a few lines of code.
