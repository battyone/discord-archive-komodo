I find it  almost as difficult as to stomach someone forking Komodo, bastardizing the code, and blaming Komodo because they didn't understand the Komodo code. It's a shitshow, to be sure, and I like to keep the record straight, both for posterity and because blaming Komodo for what was done is like blaming Bitcoin for an earthquake on Mars.";"";"";
