Poor you üéª

You aren't the only one here with immense difficulties in their personal lives. 

Fortunately some choose not to wallow in sickening self-pity and self-righteous anger, justified or not.  Some choose not to dump their pain and suffering onto everyone they encounter.  Some choose to deal with the more painful and difficult matter of dealing with the true cause of their troubles: themselves.

There is hope, and a solution, in that.

I read the messages posted here. I read the K64 AMA. Nothing has changed, no new information has been presented apart from another claim that it is all true.

Look guys, we have discussed this situation extensively within the team and

a) the investment claims are way off the chart and unrealistic
b) the K64 team has been unable to verify the claims with publicly nor directly to our team since the announcement was made (over 3 months ago)

Our conclusion still stands and we strongly recommend people to stay out of it. We don't cencor our Discord but I ask everyone to move this discussion to #talk-other-topics. Please do not promote K64 on our Discord.

I don't get why you guys are trying to spin up some drama about all this but I can assure you that our team is alligned on this matter.";"";"ü§î (1)";
