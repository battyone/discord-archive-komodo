😃 and still - regardless of that Michelin is the 2nd largest tyre company in the world not only famous for its tyres but also for the travel guides, roadmaps and last but not least the Michelin stars that they award to the best restaurants for their cooking. 
And Duracell is even marketleader in the battery industry and ahead of Energizer and other known brands. 

Like James pointed out - ppl do like cartoons and other forms of simplyfied and abstract marketing/PR. As always exceptions confirm the rule. Its very hard to find a marketing-path the everyone can identify with/is happy with.";"";"";
