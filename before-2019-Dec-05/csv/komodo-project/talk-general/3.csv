I announced that I'd send rewards every 4 monthes, but the fact that this huge block ""happened"" made me reconsider my prediction : I was too stressed keeping funds that are not mine, and I decided to send the first part yesterday.
All voters (who voted for me ^^) should have received their part of the 30% mining, as promised. Thanks again for your support. Feel free to contact me if you want the tx details.
For information, I based the amount on yesterday's ""Reward by Miner"" from http://www.notarystats.info and made calculation with : 11639.42.
Next one will be in 4 monthes approx from now, but could be sooner if luck happens again.";"";"";
