Hey everyone, I wanted to make a small announcement.
@radix42 is currently hard at work to create a dedicated full node software port for the www.nodl.it 

This is a plug and play hardware unit for running full nodes!!

BTC is the only one who has this currently.

Now, thanks to Radix, we also have XMR, PIVX and ZEC.  
She is furiously working to add KMD and its 40+ asset chains to be run on this unit, including z address support for Pirate.

The power that this can have to show KMD's firm placement in the Crypto Ecosystem and the desire for the project to be an infinite powerhouse, is intangibale, yet valuable.  

Any Komodoshis you can find to support her in this Venture would be great.  
To date she's not received much support from the other communities, and I think it is time to show the Crypto world not only the strength of Komodo but the power of it's Community support.  

I sent 500 KMD and while I don't expect you to send the same, I want you all to know she deserves way more than than for what she is doing.
