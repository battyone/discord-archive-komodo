It allows them to verify the transaction isn't trying to do an overflow by using a really big number or trying to generate coins out of thin air,  because of the zkp ,  coin amounts can be hidden, and tx size is reduced by 80%.  My guess because a hash of the proof is a lot less data than a proof itself .  It is not a snark as a snark is an argument not a proof.
