Game companies would find reasons for blockchain *even if you wouldn't*. 
Game companies can either:
Get their own blockchain devs  (the largest ones most likely will)
OR use something like Komodo to add blockchain to their games (a very large majority of small dev compainies will most likely do this)";"";"";
