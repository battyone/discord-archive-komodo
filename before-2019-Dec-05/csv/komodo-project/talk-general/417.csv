I represent the interest of **all** miners (as a NN it's in my financial best interest to agree with you *and* do my own thing too, but I obviously do not do that)
This all came about because NNs were upset about an unknown miner (dubbed ""gigapool"") that appears to be using an effective profit switcher and doing the exact same thing
`for thousands of posts` I asserted that both NNs and ""gigapool"" doing so gives vested miners effectively 0% of these funds (unless they mine in luckpool only, then they have about 1% for much more than 1% of blocks)
This whole ""75 for 75"" is only about the greed of NNs and refuses to balance out **for all miners**";"";"";
