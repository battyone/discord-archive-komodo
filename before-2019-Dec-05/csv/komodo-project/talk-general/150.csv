Even if them picking sides doesn't mean the ""other side"" (the one without notarization) wouldn't be able to run without the support of notaries, you say they have weight when the ""legit"" chain is ""chosen"".

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"14-Dec-18 10:33 AM";"since in a a politicized scenario, it has little to do with technology, consensus protocols, etc. it seems moot the effect of having or not having notarization has on the process.";"";"";
