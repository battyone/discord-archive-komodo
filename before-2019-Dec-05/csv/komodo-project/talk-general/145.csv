Simplified Payment Verification:
```
A Bitcoin implementation that does not verify everything, but instead relies on either connecting to a trusted node, or puts its faith in high difficulty as a proxy for proof of validity. BitCoinJ is an implementation of this mode.
```

But the ZKP he is proposing will validate every block from the genesis block in ( O(1) time ) and can store a single state which will be the proof and requirement for validating further blocks. Like in Coda, may be 1 kb of data will be enough to validate the whole chain.";"";"";

IndéNodes (@Ludom  , @Yassin and @eclips) provide great notary node services and have supported the ecosystem since the launch of Komodo platform.
But today, we are proud to announce a new exciting project:  ØPay, the launch of bank services directly bundled with Komodo. 
ØPay is a service provided by Ø Crypto Union. It's a banking app (currently WIP) that use KMD as native currency, allowing users to make FIAT loans with KMD as collateral.

We invite you to test the ØPay app that already integrates KMD (please note that while in beta caution is adviced). 
Ø Crypto Union has all the benefits of an EMI banking licence and has been developing their services since July 2017.
ØPay technology and services are just at the beginning, and we hope it'll continue to improve in the future. In order to achieve this, they need the support of the Komodo Community!

This project, if successful, provides interesting benefits to our ecosystem:
- A new company and his experimented team (developers, marketing, management, banking experience, and legal advisors) integrate into the Komodo ecosystem and work to develop it.
- A direct gateway between the banking world and our decentralised ecosystem; 
- The launch of asset chains with interesting and unique properties (stable coins, loan interests, etc) with a regulated, legally compliant banking platform.
- Providing banking services for the Komodo users
- Proving the power of our technology to support true banking assets
- Make connections with other cryptocurrencies that can possibly use ØPay services in the future.";"";"";
"311426011927412747";"Ludom#5832";"10-Dec-18 08:49 AM";"We propose today this partnership and ask for the support of the community because we trust in the project. @Ludom (IndéNodes's manager) has signed guarantees that ØPay and Ø Crypto Union will work for the long-term with Komodo ecosystem:
- KMD will be the currency for dividends, interests and other profits of banking assets.
- KMD and BTC tokens will be prioritised for all new services proposed by ØPay.
- We met the Ø Crypto Union team IRL and we noted all the work already realised (development of the ØPay app, obtaining a banking licence, building an experienced team)
- All of the financial services of Ø will be moved and built on the top of Komodo technology where possible: asset chains, atomic swap, etc. 
- @Ludom is now part of the Ø Crypto Union board and no new tokens can be added without his permission. No strategical decisions can be made without his agreement.";"";"Komodo (14)";
"311426011927412747";"Ludom#5832";"10-Dec-18 08:54 AM";"After this explanation, I have to clarify what help is needed from the Komodo community:
1) We need people to test the ØPay application and we need your feedback to improve ØPay technology and services.
We invite you into the discord Ø & Komodo for further information.
https://discord.gg/mqQNvUz

2) Ø Crypto Union needs financial assistance. They have worked hard since July 2017 and the key requirements to launch the service have been reached: app and banking licence. Now, however, they are short of funds to develop what they have built. Their needs are reasonable: 125k KMD
To fund this 125k KMD, they don’t propose a traditional ICO. This is not about betting on an idea or a white paper, it’s about delivering projects and services.
You can send KMD to RXQpT2t2FyFSNTWtgMq594nwGrsHtpknxD (address owned by @jl777c who escrows the funds). At each 25k KMD financing milestone, Ø Crypto Union will develop a new service on ØPay:
1) Launch of an asset chain and a new token KSB, a stable coin backed by debt.
2) Migration of our security token (GXE on Ethereum) to a Komodo asset chain (OUR token).
3) Create a line of credit with your KMD in collateral.
4) Standard credit/debit card allowing you to buy natively in Komodo.
5) Further integration of a Komodo Wallet with multisig and other features.

The funds are escrowed until the service is delivered and tested by the community.
To thank all the people who help to finance the projects, you’ll receive 7 OUR token for each KMD you send.
OUR tokens are the shares of the Ø Crypto Union, it’s a security token.";"";"";
"311426011927412747";"Ludom#5832";"10-Dec-18 08:54 AM";"I invite you to visit the dedicated crowdfunding webpage: https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

We’ll be very happy to answer your questions on the Ø & Komodo Discord or you can contact privately @forkhembo, @Adli, @I_R_Ben or me.
I really hope this announcement make you as excited as me and I hope the Komodo community will answer positively to the crowdfunding campaign.
Cheers !!!
