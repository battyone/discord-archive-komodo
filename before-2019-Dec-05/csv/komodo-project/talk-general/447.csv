We are setting up a framework to help people build on top of the current modules.
@Regnar  has a PR in that has a list of many new resources `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation/pull/28/commits/12821388f3fe3f59a9f982fb0af9cda94e2759a0`.
We have created a Trello to help with developing on the Assets Module here `https://trello.com/b/tpEsu2j1/module-assetshttps://trello.com/b/tpEsu2j1/module-assets`.
I'll add a card for your lesson/tutorial suggestion (you can add/modify it if you like :) )

Is it possible or is there any benefit to allowing the stable coin creator to split and keep a portion of their locked kmd 5% reward if they take a reasonable loan of say 50% or less deposit for a long period of time.
