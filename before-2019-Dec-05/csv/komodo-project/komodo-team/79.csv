While all altcoin creators are busy promoting the superiority of their creation, bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared. Satoshi Nakamoto does not take part in a meet-up or conference and not make plausible speeches about the development direction of bitcoin. bitcoin is neutral and is entirely based on public trust. this is a bitcoin advantage that other altcoin can never imitate. bitcoin is the right money for an era of distributed trust.

bitcoin is on the verge of a leap of trust. It is not small-scale startups or idealists who play a role in strengthening trust in bitcoin. It is a conglomerate with capital and power. Already, smart conglomerates have seen the potential of bitcoin as well as the opportunity to commercialize it immensely. they are pushing for bitcoin-related projects, sometimes publicly and secretly. when the time is right, conglomerates will show their true colors and try to monopolize the bitcoin-related market.";"";"";
