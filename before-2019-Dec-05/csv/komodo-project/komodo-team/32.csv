Not official.  Yes, good point.  These are things that marketing and the agency have on the table.  There is a some unity required, and 1 or 2 community sites will 99.9% be voted to receive some branding love as well as better resource linking.

""We are all involved in the education aspect, it's part of our social contract to leave something for other people to learn from"" (paraphrased badly) was what was said to me in the first meeting.  This is another part we are working on, a ""learn more"" area for traders and developers.

peer2krd and notary involvement with the world/community/side-projects as well.  There are non-english speaking forums where out of all popular equihash coins, kmd is the lowest mentioned.

Has anyone used this peer2krd?  Has anyone ordered?   @Virginia (Peer2Group) how many batches/customers can you guys support - i read in one channel the first batch of cards is out and waiting for next batch - which EU countries etc.  need more info.  Can you work with community #komodo-team - i had a quick look at kmd twitter and a message was retweeted once or twice in mid July.  Do you want more ppl to sign up, can you work with this channel first for feedback and i'll see what our writing resources are like for an update.  we recently wrote about a partnership with gonetcoins which has a service in canada entering the US with reloads available in many stores via virtual ATM.

@Regnar nice twitter poll üòÉ  thanks for getting the info, it is quite interesting.

@Kay Gee sell brand to who? 

I'd like to re-visit the twitter poll concept.";"";"";

This is in alpha testing, history is in #cc-general channel.  https://github.com/imylomylo/KMD-CC-Token-Test-Guide/tree/master/rpc/faucet

Unfortunately i ran into a conflict with a docker image for testing contracts.  Docker is a technology where you can basically ""press play"" and you have a service.  It needs some further work but makes the dev-experience for non-system (e.g. front end) & other tech users quite easy to get involved.  https://github.com/imylomylo/docker-komodod is the start, it needs some docs and maybe a simple dev front end so community can get involved during alpha phase.

There is also lightning network testing being done with a side project, which integrates with smart contracts - hopefully include community too!!";"";"üÜí (3)";

Imo copy should always sell the brand to the reader, all readers- that‚Äôs why there is copy.  Surely that is why there is a website, right? To inform and involve KMD users and to grow the KMD user base? Selling the brand just means explaining why KMD over ETH, for example.

On each page, in each block of text, you want to trigger an emotional response - whether that is pathos or desire is largely irrelevant, but the stronger the emotion evoked, the greater the likelihood you will create a behavioral change. What I was clumsily saying is that short copy can sell the big picture concepts (simplicity, security, flexibility, etc.) but the CTAs don‚Äôt just have to be ‚Äú[we‚Äôre the brand/platform/ for you]‚Äù as there are deliverables which in and of themselves are seemingly creating hype - without any context.

Anyways, I‚Äôm sure you know this and I‚Äôm just riffing because of excitement: for once, this is a project I‚Äôm invested in (quite literally) rather than one I‚Äôm being paid to care about. 

There may also be an element of advanced procrastination at play üòâ";"";"";

the economy now involves ""robots"".  they create value, and now that value is programmable.  they're pseudo-autonomous - and nobody wants to pay for software to run these machines.  my 2c";"";"";

But if we turn that clay into bricks, move our product/service one step down the line, it's much easier to show them they can build a house of bricks. So we either need to take that step ourselves and develop these bricks for use, or we need to find others who are willing to turn our clay to bricks and then sell it themselves.";"";"";

the server for the ""community news site"" has been provisioned - probably be a few days til it's testable.
