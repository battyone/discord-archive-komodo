Watabou is the creator of pixel Dungeon, a roguelike game for computers and mobile. Over 5Million downloads on google playstore.

I'm not sure how we can really showcase what RogueCC can do, I have to read more into it and look for a great selling point. I also don't know what exactly about it would get Watabou to build on it, like a series of unique points that can't be gained elsewhere.";"";"";

"364083722154278923";"Cryptofist#7504";"20-Feb-19 11:07 PM";"I believe so, RogueCC only works with the Rogue Game or interfaces based off of it( graphics in game, GUI, menus, etc) 
We could change all of the outputs (monster names/item names) use the drawing in ascii for specific graphics to display too, so you could make something like a Pirate themed version of Rogue  that would be on the same chain. 

... and that's just RogueCC though.  JL777c can work with other devs to make say PixelDngCC, FortniteCC and the like. 

I believe there wil/ be specific engine based CC contracts at some point as that makes some sense to have framework built.

There was some discussions I had with JL about the games, in short Rogue can be altered but not changed to an engine that is different, without severely heavy dev work. 

What can also be done is add additional features to the game on the outside (DEX, leaderboard, multiplayer, etc) this is where the tech will grab the gaming industry by the horns. There is a TON of possibilities here....";"";"";

Might be a turn off to open source devs when you start talking about tokenization and blockchain.
