In the world of business, this is often said to warn of the opposite. ""The best product doesn't necessarily win."" Economists say it's because of 'path dependence.' In other words, certain historical environments, independent of objective quality, can determine which products will be widely accepted. True, but that doesn't mean that the key arrangement we use now is purely accidental. Rather, it is better to think of distribution as a necessary part of the product. If you have invented something new, but you have not invented a way to sell it effectively, your business will be terrible. No matter how good the product is, it's no use.";"";"üíØ (3)";

so it's no use being the first mover if someone follows in and takes the top spot. I'd rather be a 'last mover' than that. that is, the last great development in a particular market is to enjoy exclusive profit for several years, even decades. the way to do so is to take over a small niche, then expand its scale from there and move toward an ambitious long-term vision. business is similar to chess in this respect.
