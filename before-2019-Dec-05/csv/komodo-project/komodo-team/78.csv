We moved this channel up to this 'community lounge' category so it's more accessable. We archived other team channels so now it's just this one. In other words, all that discussion can now happen on this single channel.

We are also trying to improve the Discord experience and moved few things around. Let us know if you like the new approach and how we could further improve the user experience.";"";"";

It hasn't been very clear over the years exactly what sets kmd apart from the other coins. To the public the other coins are easier to understand and easy to market , hence easy to speculate. Kmd changes so fast is harder for the public to pin down exactly what it is, ICO platform, decentralized DEX, DPOW service, CC, etc. This I assume is why the Ideas by Nature was brought in to do rebrand. The harder concept to get across though seems to be kmd is advertising to projects as a place to build, and the projects through advertising themselves ultimately advertise kmd and userbase grows. The thing for anxious speculators to do seems to be either help advertise to new projects, or support the projects that are appearing so as they can naturally be the ones to market kmd. Ie: Help advertise chainmakers, pirate, k64, redfoxlabs, etc";"";"";
"403137719049519106";"Audo#5667";"17-May-19 02:34 PM";"righ, we are trying to address this on the rebrand and think about how we should explain KMD – the currency.

I am trying to find the right concepts & words to describe what we have.

I think it's semi-public info that KMD will have sidechains. Any CC-module can be turned into a new KMD sidechain. The cool thing is that anyone can launch these sidechains, so it's truly open source / open / permissionless.

How should we explain this so that the average crypto enthusiast understands and gets exited?

Should we simply talk about ""side chains""? But then that could be confused with all the other ""independent chains"" that we have on the Komodo ecosystem.

So I was thinking what if we talk about KMD ""feature extensions"", and that KMD is modular money that anyone can extend with new features (unlike the other coins).

Would that make sense? What type of words/language do you guys think would work here?";"";"";

> Most platforms are dependent on their ecosystem currency to power the platform; on Komodo it is not the case. Both the KMD currency and all the projects of the platform can exist on their own, yet they have a synergetic relationship.

1. KMD is the base currency of our atomic swap technology
2. KMD can get unlimited amount of new features via side chains (that we could call feature extensions)
3. KMD has utility within the Komodo Platform such as through the Komodo Platform services (dPoW, soon interoperability)

How does the Komodo Platform & ecosystem help KMD?

4. Platform business & developer adoption brings in new technology innovations that KMD can adopt
5. Ecosystem business adoptio drives users to the ecosystem, which then likely become KMD users as well
6. Businesses & projects of the Komodo ecosystem can rely on KMD to be intermediary currency everyone uses and trusts. All new Komodo based products & services will likely accept KMD";"";"";
