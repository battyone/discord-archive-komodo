I'm thinking if they want the explorer it creates a <YOURCOIN.explorer.dexstats> explorer for them. 

With this it might also be a cool idea to have a live demo with modular color schemes, description, and logos for their custom explorer. I'm thinking if they provided a logo, we use the logo on the page and also extract the colors from the logo to create a way to simply click and change the color scheme of their explorer using the extracted colors (add a regular palette too) they could even match it to their external websites colors if they have one. They then fill in a type box of their chain's description, and another field for their website URL if they have one. 

Then while looking at the demo, they finalize it all and we add the Wallet: <link agama> Exchanges: <link BarterDEX>, and some ""powered by Komodo"" logo or something too. Basically a modular way to build something like the PIRATE explorer <https://explorer.pirate.black/> which looks like a different wrapper on the regular kmd.explorer.


Along with the explorer should be clearer, on-page API documentation so they don't have to go through insight github looking for docs, and also know what APIs will be activated (total supply, circulating supply, active wallets, or other metrics that are useful for businesses and 3rd parties, like if they are building their own mobile wallets) 

With this explorer and the APIs, we can then pass along all this information they have already filled out to this form <https://coinpaprika.com/add/> or perhaps work out a better way with coinpaprika, in order to list their new coin. There's a lot of extra detail they would be better off going to coinpaprika to do themselves, but the initial listing is valuable and only possible with API endpoints to a valid explorer for things like circulating supply.";"";"";
"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"09-Feb-19 12:12 AM";"Basically I laid out a lot of steps, but it would be a huge value add to simply point and click your own custom explorer to be added, have it match your projects colors simply(palette extractor) and have the relevant API endpoints available on the explorer and submitted to Coinpaprika (I use them because they have been super helpful when I submit changes and API updates for Komodo projects)";"";"";

Pick which coin you want to airdrop to (any coin in the ecosystem), select ratio to drop, some basic things like minimum 10 coins in address, max 100k or something, and it calculates how many coins it will create to do the drop (this part is iffy and would probably be better as an estimate) and then pick the date/time/or block number to do the airdrop.";"";"";

My assumption is that being a market leader, they would want to build value-add features and credibility in their own technical stack versus endorsing a project. If you remember back to the CZ interview on Fortune.com, he pointed out that Komodo and Tendermint would be the 'future platfoms' to succeed. I'm sure he's aware we're the leader in atomic swaps, but they chose to use tendermint to build a proxy dex. The difference being KMD is a coin listed on their exchange, and tendermint not having one.
