The Technology/Overview section on the page should have buttons/links after each section that acts as a CTA that either links to appropriate page or contact form. So Security should have button like ""Secure my Chain"" that links to the security service section, and so on.

Also things like Interoperability, Adaptability, and Scalability should have maybe two CTA buttons like ""Make your project scalable"" or ""Get Started"" which lead to ""Blockchain Starter Kit"" for the new projects and another page that is made for already built projects. I think the ""Starter Kit"" makes sense for new projects but if we are to help active projects scale, we want them to migrate, so another section under Developer Portal or Solutions should be something called ""Blockchain Migration Kit"" which is more inviting for active projects who might see ""starter kit"" and be turned off by the idea of ""starting over"". The migration kit could show specific features that help them do this. These might be about Atomic Swaps specifically to bring ERC20 or other chain to Komodo etc.

Thoughts?";"";"";
