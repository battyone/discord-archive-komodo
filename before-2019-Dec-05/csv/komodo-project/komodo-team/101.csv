1. We need a tipbot on twitter. One that can send KMD and ARRR to anyone even if they haven't already activated it. This way one can tip another user first and when they ask you ""what the F is this KMD"" you just say ""well, now you are invested in it, so take a look"".
2. This is going a bit overboard but: If one could build a same kind of frame to youtube. If youtube wouldn't agree to use tipbots in comment sections, but with a browser extension that recognizes youtube you still could tip ovet youtube to for example crypto tubers.";"";"";

"394801139440156673";"Hember#5341";"19-Nov-19 05:12 PM";"So.. I was thinking about the ""forced tip"" that one could give to another although they aren't yet using the system. To really have a psychological impact this would be an important feature to have. But if there was such a ""forced tip"" I think it would also need to be a tip that returns to the sender if the person receiving the tip wouldn't collect it.
This is because it is possible that people try to tip big influencers, but those creators are millionaires. They would not collect the tip.
But to a person who gets a ""big"" tip from a subscriber giving him a days work of money, that would be a blessing. And the reaction in a content creators mind is to than that person giving the money.
Some projects are probably trying to use these millionaire influencers. That is why their product will die. Some people first think it is great to pay your idol yourself, but that is the only thing they will use it for - paying millionaires. These project do this because they do not already have a currency that is really worth something and valuable itself. But Komodo has, so the strategy can and should be diffetern.";"";"";

"394801139440156673";"Hember#5341";"19-Nov-19 05:14 PM";"Now, I would love to be able to be the first, or one of the first people on the internet to make some donations and a video about this project. I myself would love to make another small but talented creators day. And I am sure as the word goes out again and again about how someone ""just made my day/week/month/year"" then the millionaires would start using it too to monetize their content further.";"";"";
"394801139440156673";"Hember#5341";"19-Nov-19 05:17 PM";"But by this time there would be a community that understands the value of this product to have compassion to those creators in need, and this system would carry on developing. And surely in the end it might be possible to just add AtomicDEX to it and give the people the choice to use other currencies, too. But maybe making sure that when usin KMD (or another Komodo ecosystem coin) the transaction costs were the smallest.";"";"";
"394801139440156673";"Hember#5341";"19-Nov-19 05:18 PM";"It might be nice if there was a referral link for the first people to market this product, too.

"379831514197655564";"turinglabs#2390";"19-Nov-19 05:25 PM";"i think this is a second level of process, to tune the system we first need it working and realized, then we can try to understand how people will use this and how make it better.
