"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"26-Oct-18 09:29 PM";"yep, that is unfortunate. Their tracking shows decentralized ICOs which obviously isn't where work is done on anything else KMD besides dICOs";"";"";

"153639686823346176";"bpkdasbaum#4592";"26-Oct-18 09:41 PM";"Setting new standards is always tricky, because it just adds another level. I was concerned originally that when people try to find and compare coins with high activity, and look at KMD, when on crypto miso it appears as if KMD is dead, although that's not the case. Ideally we'd have something that can be visible / shared on third party sites. So when people do compare to other projects, they see that KMD is active.";"";"";
"153639686823346176";"bpkdasbaum#4592";"26-Oct-18 09:42 PM";"I see activity in general in high regard. Be it wallets, transactions or in this case github commits.";"";"";

"153639686823346176";"bpkdasbaum#4592";"26-Oct-18 09:45 PM";"Only need to create visibility for it that can also be used by third party sites. If it was for example only on the kmd website, it would only reach ppl who are already interested in KMD and visit the site to find out more. But if we show up on comparison sites like blocktivity and also get high scores there, then this brings ppl in who haven't even looked into KMD yet";"";"";

"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"26-Oct-18 10:13 PM";"Which means if we track a repo, we need to explain and show how that repo is related to KMD development. which right now a lot of KMD development is done through other Repos like Staked, KMDice, etc. and then there's also development that is technically third party but is on run time forks and can be brought back to KMD like Veruscoin (though this stuff shouldn't be tracked) it's a tricky situation but it's also the nature of a truly decentralized project. clarity is key";"";"";

"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"27-Oct-18 07:25 PM";"Oh @actionslacks I didn't take your statement as skepticism, nor is it a bad thing if it was! haha skepticism is good in crypto! yea it's tough to get an accurate gauge of the development being done, or trusting self reporting, which is why I was saying we openly show what we are tracking and why, so others can verify it.";"";"";
