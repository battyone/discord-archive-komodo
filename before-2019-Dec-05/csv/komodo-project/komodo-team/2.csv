China's version of Bitcoin will most likely win.

The notary nodes that are based in Asia will have the correct version of the Komodo history, and the entire ecosystem will realign to their most recent states.

Everyone who was disconnected from the largest Bitcoin network will have been vulnerable during the period that they did not have access to the dominant blockchain sector.

If any particular area of the world is concerned about that, they should build out their Internet infrastructure.";"";"";

My name is Omri Erez I am a developer, entrepreneur, and a Blockchain enthusiast. In addition, I am co-organizing a meetup series in Hamburg, Germany. We are currently running the biggest Blockchain meetup in Hamburg and would like to invite Komodo to present. Our meetup is held once a month. 

Here are some links: 
1. Meetup Group: https://goo.gl/wgmQPo 
2. Our next event: https://goo.gl/NgG3jy 
3. Our past events: https://goo.gl/nQ8yYb 

Some notes: 
1. All presentations are done in English as our community is international. 2. Our crowd is very mixed. Some with deep technical background but mostly people who are interested in the technology or want to learn more about it 
3. The main goals of the event is to exchange knowledge, grow your Blockchain network and to feel free to ask anything. 
4. We are organizing this meetup voluntarily, without any financial benefits and any costs are going from our own pocket. It will be great to have you! 

Please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (https://goo.gl/SGaCD4) for any questions, commented, ideas and pretty much anything else :) I wish you a great day, Long Live our Distributed Future :) Omri```";"";"";
