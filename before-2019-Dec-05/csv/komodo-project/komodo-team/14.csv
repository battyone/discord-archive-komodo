 - Ben: Social Media and community engagement
 - Audo: I help out everywhere I can, like community building!
 - Daniel & Davion: our writers (currently part-time)
 - Bryan: animation/video (part-time)
 - Graphics: we are looking for someone to come full time

When it comes to marketing strategy, Steve would be the best guy to explain. In short, there are few things we need to have a solid foundation for effective marketing:

 - Clear vision about what our Komodo project wants to do and achieve
 - Brand architecture among all the various parts and projects we have
 - Messaging and stories to quickly explain what we do and how our tech works

The goal is to have a clear brand for Komodo. That means, that if I say ""Komodo"" you will think about one thing... and that one thing is the most important thing.

If I say Shapeshift, you think of an easy exchange service
If I say Ethereum, you think of a smart contract platform for developers
If I say, Stratis, you think of a blockchain provider for the enterprise

If I say Komodo, what do you think?

If we ask this from many people, I would guess we would get very diverse answers ranging from DEX, to dICO platform, to privacy coin... and that is one of the problems we have. We need to develop a clear brand and messaging for Komodo for the marketing to work.

If our community struggles to explains what we do, how can we ever grow?

At the moment it looks like we are planning to brand Komodo as an ""end-to-end blockchain technology provider"" that allows everyone to launch their independent blockchain.

I also want us to talk more about 'ecosystem', and that is where I believe our vision comes in. We provide technology for the whole industry to build an interoperable ecosystem. Komodo itself is not an ecosystem; it is just helping to build an ecosystem.";"";"";

Doing a complete media kit is in the plans, which I think is partly what you were talking about.

We could do a 'history' section to the website or somewhere... would that work? That is not a high priority though at the moment, there are many more crucial issues to be done first.";"";"";

It will allow organic growth in awareness about the platform, because it will allow many people for easy access of information. Easy access for information collected in chronological order in one place is sth basic for marketin I believe, people need to land somewhere when they hear about KMD. Current site is nice, maybe adding a blog section in a tab + some twitter box on the front would make it more ""alive"" ... I think marketing guys will know it better.";"";"üòÉ (1)";
