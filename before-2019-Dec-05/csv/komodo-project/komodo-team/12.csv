I think we should make one specifically for coin announcements getting listed on BarterDEX. I tried doing this a while back but the updates of new coins seemed spaced out and made distribution of any marketing material difficult/last minute. I was thinking we could have a pre made template with komodo logos and listing announcement etc and when coins put their info in on Github to be listed, they can give their logo and the email address of whoever runs their social media, and we simply add their logo to the graphic and email it to their social media person saying, ""hey here's our official announcement poster, your coin should be supported on X day, feel free to post this to your Twitter and tag us and we'll retweet!""

The github request makes it so we can reach out into other coin communities and get unique impressions.

The Komodo blockchain offers security and interoperability services for all the other blockchains on our ecosystem.

The best option in my mind would be to talk about ""Blockchain as a Service"", ""Infrastructure as a Service"" or ""Platform as a Service""... but we are little concerned to promise this as currently we have a DIY model.
