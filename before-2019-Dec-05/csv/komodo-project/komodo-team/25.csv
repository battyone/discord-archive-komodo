Cool article - great to see higher throughput from EOS.

TPS record was set by Komodo in May 2018 at 20k tps, data here https://komodostats.com/sca...

And description here: https://i.mylomylo.com/komo...

KMD news article about the method https://komodoplatform.com/...

And a more recent load test: https://en.insider.pro/info... with infographic https://insdrcdn.com/media/...

Komodo will post all details for download and verifiability throughout further testing.

Any details please ask Mylo in the KMD discord (#scaling-test) for further details. We will continue to optimise KMD scaling solutions to 1 million tps.

Cheers

I would call it more aggressive marketing (contacting 3rd parties co-working with competing solutions to check out KMD for comparison).

As part of the Komodo Pioneers notary election, we encourage ppl to start meetups.  Because I'm least likely to participate in meetup activities, I threw the idea of a komodo ecosystem website https://imgur.com/a/n7qG2 (this is the mockup).

If the community wants some way to republish information, i can work towards iKomodo being a community site.  I've got the ways of getting accurate information required through dev/marketing/community here - just need to work on the publishing model.  And once someone works out how (and shares how) to IPFS host  (decentralized web) something like this, then ikomodo doesn't have to be the centralized point of accuracy.

There's reddit.com/r/ikomodo we can use, it's private at the moment but if this is a direction the community marketing wants to go - let's do it.
