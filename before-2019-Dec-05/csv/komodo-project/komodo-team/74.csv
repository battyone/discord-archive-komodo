1) We have few different dev projects going on simultaniously, for example few weeks ago we gave this sneak peak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaH8oR5nXpg
2) Business & product strategies have to be finalized
3) Marketing messaging & branding has to be completed

We have done good progress on all aspects, but none of them is finished ‚Äì and they all must be fully finished for us to go online with the rebrand.

Expect it all to still take time. We are not rushing this as it's important for our long term success. Our rebrand is not about marketing, but more developing a product and business development.";"";"";
