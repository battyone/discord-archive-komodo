The solution is a form they can fill and make an appeal. If they do that and promise to behave we are happy to unban them.

The pricing we have is like a discovery pricing. We might tweak it in the future.

For dPoW we have used the concept of grandfathering of pricing concept where we keep charging the same amount that the project signed-up with. Thus even if we raise the price later it doesn't affect the current projects who operate with certain price tag in mind.";"";"";

 this is interesting. I'm curious to know where the current pricing came from. The people complaining probably won't bite even if the price is $6500 or $4500. Probably not even at $1000. These people are just not interested at any price. For those truly interested you could probably raise the price to $10,000-$20,000 and still get just as many bites. (Has anyone done a focus group on the pricing?) The weird thing about pricing and perceived value is if you price to low, people perceive low quality. I'd price Antara at $100,000 just like a CEX listing. Those that can pay, you want, those that can't, probably won't at any price anyway. But the perceived value is alot more serious then a good bargain. We don't want to be seen as needing to beg people to buy.
 You can also always lower prices through sales, discounts, grants, student discounts, scholarship, etc. Encourage people to run through the tutorial to get a discount or do x for discount. Or offer one month a year for a sale etc. What do the sales and marketing people have to say about this? @siu - Chainmakers";"";"";
