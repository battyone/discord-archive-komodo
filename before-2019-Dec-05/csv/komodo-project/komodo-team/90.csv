Yes, we completed the rebrand and it was worth celebrating a little bit. Our message is now stronger and everyone who checks us out should better understand what we are looking to develop and what our vision is. All the pieces are now more alligned.

However, this is just the beginning and we can't just sit and expect things to magically happen. 

The goal now is to get more projects into our ecosystem.

`First documentation sprint is over, 100 pages of carefully written and endited content that is in a logical order.`
* We are now turning our focus on building educational journeys and tutorials to get people up to speed faster
`Two new products were relased, but they are in beta with limited functionality`
* We are working on finalizing their roadmaps and adding new features
`Atomic Swap Protocol is on a stable state and we get big swap success rate with our own AtomicDEX app`
* We have to release AtomicAPI and spread information about it to get other projects to adopt Komoso's atomic swap technology
`Antara Framework is relased and documentation is online`
* We have to craft together usecases that can be built today and form a marketing campaign around them, and get new businesses on board.
`Our community has grown and new people have found Komodo.`
* We have to offer better tools to empower the community and empower them to build the multi-chain ecosystem. We are looking to launch a community portal later.
* Who's building on Komodo? Where is this information? We are working on building an ecosystem dashboard to showcase the size and activity within our ecosystem.";"";"";
