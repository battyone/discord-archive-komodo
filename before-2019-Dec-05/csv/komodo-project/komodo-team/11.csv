Komodo has amazing blockchain technology and one of the best in the world but nothing to make it visible. A mediocre website that works very badly on some browsers, only one good video (atomic swap explanation) made by an assetchain, BarterDEX has now over than 150 coins and I was one of the only ones to share information, contact the creators of the various tokens to be able to gain a minimum of visibility, only two posts about Komodo's scalability on linkedIn had more than 30k views in 4d... 
Komodo need marketing to keep pace with the development of this ecosystem. And right now it's not.";"";"üíØ (3)";

What dApps do you think are going to be built on a blockchain?
Who is going to build them?
Who is going to train the people to build on a blockchain?

People are still learning about the tech and what they can potentially do with it.
A majority of software developers still think the crypto space is full of scams.

The komodo solutions are great, and there is room for improvement.  We want to welcome people external to the crypto scene into the komodo ecosystem.

In the last 6 months, the DEX has seen 100k atomic swaps and a few dICOs.  This has been marketed.   These are historical notes of Komodo's achievements.  This technology is available to anyone.

A new baseline is being set by Komodo from it's history and tech innovation - one that needs to be delivered professionally, succinctly and at the right time.

This tech has the potential to co-exist with large cloud vendors and integrate with many other projects and solutions.";"";"";
