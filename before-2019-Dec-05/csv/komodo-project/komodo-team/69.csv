"395274075985018880";"Regnar#6164";"11-Jan-19 05:10 PM";"**Assumptions leading to Question:**
Komodo has been a platform in which products are built on top that either utilize KMD, or utilize services of 3rd parties that hopefully drive back value to KMD and Komodo. Asset chains for example drive back value to the Komodo ecosystem through dPoW costs, tech development (like Verus), bringing more users who may buy KMD, use contracts paid in KMD, use BarterDEX (generate fees), Jumblr(fees) and others.

But technically things like Jumblr, BarterDEX, etc are not exactly Komodo (from my understanding) though mostly developed by the same devs that are on the Komodo team. They are 3rd party programs, apps, services that create more value for the platform. They generate revenue from the service itself being valuable (not a token required to be used for the service) but then use the revenue collected to purchase KMD on open market and distribute to their owners (creating demand for KMD). Broad generalization btw.

**Question:**
As Komodo rebrands (or positions itself in the market building tools catered to certain target markets) is the goal to continue this cycle, 3rd party development of products and services with attempts to tie those services into the value of KMD (without choking innovation and adoption like ETH), or is Komodo going to look to establish it's own products, partnerships, services? and can it technically make partnerships with companies without having a foundation (non code-controlling) or some other ""entity"" to sign papers?

For example I think of Mozilla Foundation.";"";"üëçüèº (1),üëèüèº (1)";
