Ledger has obviously been nothing but problems, and I remember from a while back Stick was pretty receptive to the idea and he knows some Komodo Devs? Maybe we should set up a twitter blast to randomly target some of their tweets with Komodo integration comments, likes, retweets. Could potentially focus on the fact Ledger hasn't resolved core issues we need for too long and they'd likely make a lot more sales of KMD holders moving from ledger (like me) though this may appear adversarial, I think we've given Ledger enough time to correct this issue.
