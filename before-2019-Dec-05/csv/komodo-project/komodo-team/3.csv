"450229834912628746";"regnar#0000";"03-Jun-18 08:35 PM";"Komodo scaling development likely to reach finish line first for actual secured crypto transactions scaling.

no reason to shard one big chain if everything is automatically segregated into their own chain, anti-sharding.

KMD creates one giant meta chain out of cluster of chains so we just secure all independent chains via dPoW and use KMD to generate proofs for cross chain smart contracts.

Scaling is easy if you skip security and decentralization, but is nonsensical to do so, Komodo solution truly will remain decentralized and secure while scaling.

KMD scaling is built on BTC codebase and is proven tech, not white paper theory.

scaling chains are independent chains using the same cluster ID and mining nodes and we have scripts to automatically spawn chains including explorers. Each chain is secured through Bitcoin hashrate through dPoW.

We can recycle Bitcoin's electricity, one coin using 0.5% of all electricity is a bit extreme, but we can use that same electricity to secure an entire ecosystem of thousands or eventually millions of chains, then it's not so wasteful at all.

Marketing this new tech isn't as easy as some facebook and twitter ads. Triply nested cryptographic proofs are more difficult to understand than atomic swaps. Yes Atomic Swaps, those UTXO based cross chain trustless swaps powering the BarterDEX and HyperDEX.
