A clear and precise outline of what it is that KMD exactly does or wants to do is more helpful IMO. The more precise, the better. If you want to highlight everything it can do, it becomes a little overwhelming and detracts from the appeal, imo it would be better to concentrate on 3 or 4 core points where it excels and outshines others. Besides this effort it can always be helpful to explain in detail every feature (separately), just not everything in one go. Just my 2 cents.";"";"";
