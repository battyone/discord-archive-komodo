Is it possible to use crypto conditions to create such a thing? For example, a meta ledger that tracks who can unlock an amount from a physical coin. A load and lock kind of mechanism.

They can only be redeemed if the next users public key was switch with the previous users public key (representing a transfer of ownership - like a meta ledger). Its not very efficient.
