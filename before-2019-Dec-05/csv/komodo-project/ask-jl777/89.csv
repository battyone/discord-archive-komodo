I myself am a big fan of writing its makefiles is even I did it a lot, only sometimes it is also necessary to adapt with his time, there are certain platforms that are in C++ much more easily targetable with CMake.

From my experience, I think that today when we think of a project from the beginning it is not a bad thing to think about those who use IDE's, you will not prevent those who want to use VI to do it.

On the other hand make a small local Makefile and supported only Linux, and think that everyone will use VI or create a script to compile, you lose the possible support of IDE's, one of my goals is to create a CMake for the Komodod project without breaking the backward compatibility with ZCash.

I can not for my part conceive of making a C++ project today without CLion, others it will be QTCreator, others it will be Visual Studio, other XCode, other emacs or VI. But the interest of CMake is that all its developers will enjoy their favorite editors/ide's.";"";"";
