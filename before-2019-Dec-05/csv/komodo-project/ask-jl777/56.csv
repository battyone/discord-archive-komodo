relative to the other block at the same index, and the scores for all blocks on each chain are 
added together: The first PoP publication for either competing block at fork index 0 was at 
index 1 of the illustrated SP blockchain. The red block at fork index 0, R0, is endorsed by three 
PoP publications which occur at index 1 of the SP blockchain, so its score is 3*(1/((1-1+1)*(1-
1+1))) = 300; R0 = 300. The orange block at fork index 0, O0, is endorsed by two PoP
publications which occur at index 1 of the SP blockchain, and one PoP publication at index 2 
in the SP blockchain, so its score is 2*(1/((1-1+1)*(1-1+1))) + 1*(1/((2-1+1)*(2-1+1))) = 225; O0
= 225. Similarly, R1 = 1*(1/((2-2+1)*(2-2+1))) = 100 and O1 = 2*(1/((3-2+1)*(3-2+1))) = 50. The 
last block in any chain never has any proof weight, because no block has come after it to 
contain PoP endorsements for it; R2 = 0 and O2 = 0. Summing these up, the weight of the red 
chain is 300 + 100 = 400, and the weight of the orange chain is 225 + 50 = 275. Since 400 >

SP, I believe is any high hash chain, I think basically Bitcoin. I don't think I saw anything for VBK chain, but it's possible I missed it in the parts i read.
