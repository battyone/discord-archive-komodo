James has said in the past that it is possible btc won‚Äôt be the king of crypto valuations.  Stablecoins likely.

Where are stablecoins going to be utilized?  In my opinion it is in multichain ecosystems.  The komodo‚Äôs cosmos‚Äôs polkadots verus.

Why in those ecosystems?  Because they will provide developers (and organizations) an arguable order of magnitude more sovereignty and security than eth v1.0 provided in 2016-2018 which.

If there are stablecoins in those ecosystems why bother with crypto like kmd atom or dots?  Because of bridges between services, dev costs, tech debt, new opportunities and functions not supported by stablecoin provider.  The devs of stablecoin have different goals to ecosystem providers and different weaknesses/pain points.

Edit:  verus chain ecosystem";"";"";
