Have you looked into adding them to the DEX?

If so, they would be a great fit, because Marshall Islands are a territory of the United States, and the US government is ashamed of how they tested nuclear bombs in their territories. 

It's unlikely the US would have public support in stopping the marshall islands from being the first sovereign atomic swappable currency.
