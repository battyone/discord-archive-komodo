In both those cases, SNMP endpoints are embedded into equipment (usually low level language) but at the same time applications (and app servers like jboss etc.) can be MIBS for network monitoring information.  HL7 i know less about, but it's so an X-ray machine can talk to the application running on a DRs' computer to display the image which is transported from device to file storage, from file storage to application etc.  and then a related workflow is also tied to HL7 protocol stuff so the time sheet application can bill the patient record accordingly.  and similarly for nurses doing the rounds giving medication etc.";"";"";

if you are thinking to poll an external service for data to input into contract stuff, then which node would poll?  which node would insert into blockchain?  this is not the (ideal) architecture for a smart contract blockchain app.   the smart contract relies on blockchain data, so you'd need to find another way to get the data into the blockchain.  if you publish too many times into the blockchain then, which is the authoritative data?  how large would the data bloat the chain. your options for this line of thinking is either via oracle network or something.

Then I can build a web page that makes RPC requests to a local KMD daemon to interact with the CC. And the RPC request would be something like `{ccaddress: address, command: 'echo', value 'helloworld'}`

Something like that?";"";"";

Except first step.  Yes you compile down.  Yes you then have your node with the CC smart contract you wrote.  But other nodes won't have it to reference except the tx they'll know, but won't know anything to do with it because they haven't got it installed in their node.  Each node then needs your special smart contract.

Might not be relevant to the KMD main chain to know about LukesJSEchoCCSmartContract (i mean it could, but unlikely), but some AC use case your smart contract solves can load your contract at start up - and decentralize/trustless verify the tx on it's own.";"";"";
