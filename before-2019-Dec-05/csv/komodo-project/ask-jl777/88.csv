When it's on one chain, someone can see 10 coins go into Z address, and 10 coins go out. If the pool is small enough (and it almost always is with t and Z chains) then this analysis is very effective at beating privacy.

Z pool size is a good way to protect against this, but still is only really effective if people send into the Z pool uniform amounts and leave them in the Z pool for random amounts of time. Jumblr was designed to do this actually, break balance into specific amounts (100, 10, etc) and send into z pool, and send out at random times, this way everyone's ""in"" and ""outs"" were the same sizes... but even still, the pool was too small to effectively mask transactions.";"";"";

Traditional SPV wallets (lite wallets, like mobile, or websites) don't download the whole blockchain, but download the headers from the whole blockchain, if the headers all line up, it can be pretty sure that it's address/transactions are correct. This however downloads ALL the block headers, which can actually become quite a bit of data, especially as blockchains grow longer, and a wallet might handle dozens of coins.

nSPV does the same thing as SPV, except instead of downloading ALL of the headers, it pays particular attention to Notarizations (exclusive to Komodo) The wallet treats the notarization basically as the beginning of the chain, as it is infeasible for anyone to change the info before a notarization. This means nSPV wallets are hundreds, if not thousands of times more efficient than SPV wallets. It uses a tiny amount of RAM to verify transactions and makes it ideal for IoT and low computing power devices like watches.";"";"🔥 (4),shexy (1),treasure (1),👍 (3)";

this is in contrast to normal SPV wallets which need dedicated Electrum servers which can only take so much load (as the number of concurrent users increase, more Electrum servers are needed)
so nSPV tech helps in scalability(not in tps but in number of lite clients supported) too

what IDE do you use?
I know there is a spectrum from vim/gcc up to stuff like clion and this is an interesting fundamental question..
I used pycharm for some stuff in python and I sort of really hated it (bloated container ship that could hog your whole computer just to tell you that your code style was not according to pep1217 or whatever), but it had some features I did not want to miss-
what about c programming?
sublime is a cool text editor with syntax highlighting, but these bare bones things usually only work for 'helloworld'
Do you use some make or automake?
I was exposed to makefiles 15 years ago and it is rather an art, not an exact science...";"";"";
