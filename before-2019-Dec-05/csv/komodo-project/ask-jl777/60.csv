Hi James, This was an amazing read! Also started reading your blog posts on medium.
 I'm wondering how is Komodo planning on protecting every solution the you or the team finds/designs/develops. Stuff like oracle solutions... Do you just plan on being way ahead of others in terms of dev that they won't have time to catch up ?
At the moment there is a ton of innovation being produced in Komodo but it is completely unheard of. How do you plan on finding clients since the majority ignores how smart contract work and the inherent fundamental problems they carry with them ?
So if the platform does not get any traction in terms of projects onboarding, what will prevent other platforms to shamelessly copy and adapt komodo developed solutions since the project is open source ?";"";"";

Generally in most blockchains, the chain with the most cumulative work is considered the correct one.  (Many people think of this as 'longest chain', but this is wrong, a chain that was longer but at lower difficulty could have less cumulative work).  
In Komodo, notary nodes are allowed the chance to periodically produce one block at a low difficulty, to gain their rewards.  This results in notary nodes collectively getting a large portion of the total blocks.   
My question is:  does the best chain in komodo consider these notary node produces blocks as counting as low difficulty for purposes of determining the correct chain?  Or do they count at the same weight as normally mined (high difficulty) blocks?
This is important because if they count at the same weight, then Notary Nodes have a much greater impact on determining the correct chain than they 'should', which one could say was more centralized because notary nodes would have far more ability to determine the best chain than their proof of work would indicate.";"";"";

I guess when making something you will depend on yourself, you go the extra mile, but really I just made the fewest changes to an already working system. That seems the best way, especially with consensus systems, where seemingly easy things to do like DAA is full of pitfalls. So if it aint broke, I dont fix it. Which mean just adding to the already existing checkpointing and later when we found some 90%+ hashrate attack needed to specifically prevent reorging notarized chain, we added that. The final aspect that made it as close to 100% protection as I can imagine was the dpowconfs. That simply sets the ""confirmations"" field to 1, until it is notarized. With that trivial change, exchanges that rely on ""confirmations"" > N automatically wait for notarizations. We found that exchanges just wont make any changes to their payment processing code, so this was the way to get them to support notarizations without doing anything. And since the main risk of evil notaries is that notarizations can be stopped, the dpowconfs is an automatic detector for that condition";"";"";
