"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Dec-18 08:30 PM";"and for the notarized blocks, not possible";"";"";
"354332171005329408";"sgp#7572";"08-Dec-18 08:30 PM";"jl777c that's semantics though, since you could replace the notarized chain with a non-notarized or even a different notarized one. That argument is basically saying that you can't double-spend if you only use one chain, which we know is false since an attacker spins up a different chain";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Dec-18 08:39 PM";"so even by this fantasy scenario, dPoW is making it harder to attack a chain";"";"ðŸ˜„ (1)";
