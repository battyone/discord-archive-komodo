Based on peoples accuracy of prediction they gain reputation/points, which these points can then be used to cash out in a native token. (the reason for the reputation not being directly converted into token is a logistical, legal reasoning).

So what is needed is a chain with:
- Almost zero or zero tx fees
- Hi volume of tx/s

The reason for putting the idea on the blockchain, is to be able to prove immutably that people have earned their reputation without cheating the system.
