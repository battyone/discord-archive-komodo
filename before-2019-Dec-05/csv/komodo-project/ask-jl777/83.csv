My understanding so far is that XSN masternodes act as full wallet for different coins, users have a light wallet. Masternodes are connected via LN, they do the order matching thing and trade between them. Users withdraw real coins when done. Seems an highly efficient proxy-token dex. I could be wrong though, details are scarce";"";"";
"345992331276713984";"Acura#2748";"25-Jul-19 07:03 PM";"I had a chat with one guy from xsn. 
Asked him how i need xsn ?
 For which reason ?
This he answered to me:

Primary:

Payment of all fees (onchain tx, offchain tx, lightning swap fee).
Burn verification of dApps.
Payment of DB and CPU renting.

But you don't have to own xsn to do this. For example, if you want to pay a merchant with LTC who only accepts BTC LN payments, you can do this with LTC thanks to LN swaps and the swap fees are calculated in the backend with XSN and deducted over a separate LN swap without you noticing.

We migrate all LN features into our MN layer (channel funding, facotry channels, watchtowers, swap resolver, ...). Consequently, the MN operators are also those who benefit from most of the fees. On the other hand they have to run potent hardware to host the fullnodes with multiple blockchains or dapps.

About The Test

During the next 24 hours, we will be conducting extensive tests with our AtomicDEX wallet application.

Please note that our tests are primarily focused on testing atomic swaps and network connectivity issues. As a secondary focus, we are also collecting feedback about the overall wallet functionality and user experience.

Let‚Äôs get started!";"";"";
