I have in mind using these tokens to represent warehouse receipts used to claim stored goods, specifically standardized commodities but it can and will be expanded to other goods as well.

Beyond stablecoins(warehouse receipts ),  many chains ( fees to Komodo ),  liquidity ( more things for KMD to trade against )  it provides the ecosystem with a form of ‚Äúgood‚Äù money ( Gresham law reference )  which can siphon from even other coins and their liquidity";"";"";

Basically what I came up with for tokens was to create the token, this can use a normal OP_RETURN which will stay as an unspent output that can be referanced by all tokens with this tokenid, so the tokens themself dont need to carry the data, obviously you cant send this data to another chain easily, MoMoM has some functionality for this, but not 100% sure its perfect to actualyl be used, I simply disabled the entire thing on LABS at least for now.";"";"";
