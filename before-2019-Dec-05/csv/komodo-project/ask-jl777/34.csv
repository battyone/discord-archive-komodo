Hi Justin,
Thanks for the article. I think there are a some misunderstandings. On the recent Tech Tuesday for Komodo [1] I've detailed the process of dPoW that might clear up the caveats section?¬†
Figure 3 in your article is not possible. An attacker cannot mine past a notarization point and have the rest of the network just accept the attackers chain. If you read the Tech Tuesday (last article), the notarization hashes form part of the network wide consensus. The attacker does not have the recent hashes and will be ignored. The way you've drawn Figure 3 is just normal PoW ignoring dPoW features in the consensus.
Also, the KMD easy mining is only for KMD chain. Notary nodes do not get easy mining for any other chains.
Come to the komodo discord to discuss for any further discussion.
All the best with your writing, thanks for taking the time to check out dPoW‚Ää-‚Ääit has a history of protecting weaker chains.
