Is adding merge mining an option. I know various older coins have played with that type of thing. Though I believe that even on those, hash rate has historicaly declined with out new coin reward. Too bad Komodo miners couldn't merge mine chips.

The profit switcher seems more of an attack. If the attack is really only feasible till chips takes off, what would be the cost to add hash till chips is seeing more demand? 
Maybe POS Chips? What do other coins do to protect against this issue?";"";"";
