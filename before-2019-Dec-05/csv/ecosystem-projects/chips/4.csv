Now the MofN will be set to (N+2) and (N + N/2 + 2) where N is the number of players, N/2+1 notary nodes providing random blinding values and the dealer. So some combination of players dealer and notary nodes that is N+2 need to collude. If all N players are colluding, it seems to make no sense at all. in a 9 player game, 11 colluders would be needed.

notice if we can assume the notary nodes wont collude it is fully secure even if all the players and dealer collude";"";"";
