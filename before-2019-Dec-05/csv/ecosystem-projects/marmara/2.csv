As you know, we will have a policy of timelocking the coins indefinitely in Marmara. Since timelocked coins are a must to solve the non-redemption problem in credit creation, we will always have coins with timelocks in coinbase ranging from 3 months to 2 years. This makes mining in pools a great problem. So the coinbase CC will solve this problem. It will be really a great innovation in Blockchain. By this way, we will be able to decentralize the credit creation of post-dated cheques and promissory notes in Turkey with at least 200 billion USD market size.

But there is one simple fact they are hiding successfully: It is creation of money by banks as credit. Majority of money is created as credit by banks out of thin air. And this may be decentralized completely and could happen in real economy as in Post-dated cheques and promissory notes example in Turkey. Credit creation by masses in a decentralized way without banks will be a real challenging thing to their surprise.

Please take a look at this article: https://hackernoon.com/why-everyone-missed-the-most-mind-blowing-feature-of-cryptocurrency-860c3f25f1fb

He says: ""The true power of cryptocurrencies is the power to print and distribute money without a central power."" and ""You see, Satoshi understood the first part of the maxim, the power to print money. What he missed was the power to distribute that money."" 

I think peer to peer credit creation and settlement might be the solution to the ""decentralization of creation of money"" problem. In the article, he goes on to talk about ways to do it, but its all very abstract and futuristic for now.

It might be a good idea to engage him about your ideas regarding peer-peer credit creation. He has some very good ideas and has a large following. https://twitter.com/dan_jeffries1

There is a common misunderstanding about the reality of money creation by banks. Many people are confused by the theory of Fractional Reserve banking (FRB)  system. I was also confused until I read the ""lost century in Economics"" by Professor Richard Werner. The main cause for misunderstanding is the publications made by Fed. The major one is ""modern money mechanics"". In reality, it is much easier to understand. FRB is fictitious and problematic to explain banks as intermediary institutions. In reality, banks just create credits when giving loans without need of any relending. And majority of money in circulation (97%)  is created as credit. In my opinion, banking could not be replaced by Blockchain unless credit function is solved in better way than banking system.";"";"üëç (1)";

I have several more questions:

Is \'settlement\' actually a cheque redemption, that is, when cheque holder enters a bank and requests cash in exchange of the cheque?

Do I understand it right that the main purpose of the currently implemented v1.0 (aka Millenium ed) is to check how the settlement of locked coins would work and how their owner would receive some benefits from their coins being locked?
But the functionality of credit issuance itself was just very much simplified (as it does not actually send any coins to holder when credit is issued)?
So it is not the real business case but rather technology studying?

From this article https://medium.com/@cemilturun/we-had-paper-blockchains-for-decades-13ac29c4efd0
I understand that only the first cheque issuer is the payer for it. The rest cirantas just bypass it to the next holder and they do not pay anything when the cheque payment day comes. 
In our implementation all endorsers might pay when settlement is going on. I was also told actually each endorser would garantee exactly 1/N fraction from the total credit value.
So is it some new advancement for the real vadeli cheques?
(Or, maybe real vadeli endorsers also would have to pay if any previous issuer defaulted?)

Why is it needed to have endorsers at all when vadeli cheques are passed to a next holder? Why not just pass it as a usual banknote and simply allow to bearer just go to a bank and convert it to cash after the cheque has matured? (maybe, endorsers should pay if the issuer defaults)";"";"";

(Also we spoke in the chat that issuers would not need to lock their money in the version 2.)
So, how is it supposed to use this locking feature in v2, who will use it? (maybe it is other roles who will be backing credits)

I have read some about lending loops in Canada where people make small deposits and this funding is used for short time loans for small businesses. We are not implementing this model (as it does not create money), yes?

Is it correct to say that in v1.0 an issuer actually issues credit to himself and provides a collateral for it with time-locked funds?";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-May-19 07:18 AM";"pretty close. but there is always the first reciepient to create the creditloop, so it is being issued to another pubkey";"";"";

"396753788150611968";"B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626";"27-May-19 08:29 AM";"1. Yes. Settlement is actually cheque redemption at the date which is decided during issuance.
2. It is a real business even in Millennium edition (Version 1). Suppose I issue a credit of 600 MCL. When the first endorser (which is also holder) gets the baton, I buy goods and services for the amount of 600 MCL. But it does not leave my Wallet until redemption date. Furthermore, it is boosted so I get full power of staking. It is fully collateralized. At any stage, the zero defaulting occurs. However, as you discovered, the Version 1 is more miner friendly.
3. Yes, The millennium edition is simplified. The article explains the paper based analog chain Version of existing cultural system but Version 2 is a complete solution to nonredemption problem and other problems in paper version. 
4. In all versions, it works best with transfer of goods and services. But I admit that the Version 1.0 is more miner friendly since anyone can create to accounts and issue credit to himself/herself to use boosted staking. However, we want to spread Version 1 among community for exchange of real goods and services.";"";"";

If there are 3 nodes, then 1st is issuer, the 2nd is endorser and 3rd is holder. So the credit risk is divided b/w issuer and endorser as 300. The issuer gets 300 back as normal coin while ensorser's 300 is locked first and then boosted when batonapproval happens. At each step, there is 100% collateralization.";"";"";
