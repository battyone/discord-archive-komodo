For anyone who's been paying attention and is already familiar with the always consistant, above and beyond hard word and dedication from our very own developers and contributing community members, the recent efforts may come as no surprise and seem par for the course at this point, but this instance was more than just churning out consistent work while pushing forward with a massive PBaaS release, it was an effort made that reached far beyond our own community and for that, accurately qualifies as going above and beyond. It was really nice to read some very kind words directed back to the ones who helped make that happen and see the bigger picture. üåé

I like your take on the community as a whole.
I have always found it difficult to expend energy on the crypto community, as a whole. I have a lot of respect for Bitcoin. But I respect the idea of privacy, just as much, and so I discovered ZEC, then Komodo and then Verus. For me, Komodo is special bc of privacy, creativity and work ethic. A willingness to try to do something different, and solve a problem. It was atomic swaps that really got me interested in KMD.
And, they always seemed to be working on something. Plus, they were accessible, or seeing what was being worked on was.

And now here with Verus, we have those same principles I mentioned I like about Komodo, but we are doing it in our own way--with PBaaS. That's what creates a strong ecosystem--projects that are willing to innovate & stand on what they have built.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"05-Jul-19 05:17 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Roki> I never understood why some people dislike Komodo.
I stopped trying to figure that out. Because this ecosystem does contribute to everyone, whether it's dPOW or Atomic Swaps, or Verus w/Nothing @ Stake & soon to be w/PBaaS...";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"05-Jul-19 06:12 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks @Roki. Yeah me either. After my initial getting into crypto and acquiring the obligatory Bitcoin, after researching lots of projects, KMD was the first ""alt"" project I ever invested in and I still hold those very coins to this day. Seemed like a no brainer even then and they only continue to drive that point home daily. Never did see why anyone would choose eth over KMD and tbh a part of me sorta thinks there may still be some deep rooted interests who for some reason or another think it wise to hinder any other crypto related project and wrongfully view them as competition when we should all be lifting each other up like a great tide. There is plenty of room. People may be forgetting that what we aim to replace is not just simply any one market or industry, we may very well be on the cusp of a complete technological upheaval for so many things we could never even see coming and with a much farther reaching scope than the shortsighted views of those who seek to hinder progress.";"";"";

There may be a few overlapping similarities in terms of classification, but different nonetheless. 
I think what you're describing is ego and tribalism. 
Some projects are not willing to admit, for example a weakness, and allow another project to help them.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"05-Jul-19 07:07 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's my opninion that PBaaS will be an attractive option for companies, that want to use blockchain technology. A PBaaS chains comes with a complete infrastructure, autonotarization is basically the only cost for the chain. Once reserve liquidity is implemented too (on which Mike is working to bring to testnet), there's no need to acquire listing on an exchange since Verus is listed on various exchanges. Combine that with the cross chain atomic swap capability Komodo is working on and you don't need to bring your chain to any exchange. As I understood work is being done to automatically (or at least with little effort) add any PBaaS chain to the Verus Mobile Wallet, which makes it a very attractive option for companies.
Of coarse for dApps on PBaaS chains you will still need to have developers to create and connect the dApp to the chain, but that would have been necessary for any chain.";"";"";

You've regularly been sending me and others tips for months now.
By way of thanks I'd like to share a short story showing the results of your generosity.
I'm a new KMD Notary op and am just finishing the setup of my node.
One of the things I need for that is some VRSC.  Unfortunately mine is inaccessible at the moment.  I was a bit stuck because I didn't want to ask the other ops for some.  Then I remembered your tips.
Over the last few months the tips that you have been sending have added up to enough to fund Verus notarizations for quite some time :)
I'd like to let you know that your efforts in making this such a cool place are very appreciated.
Thank you!

No one would know, as it is as complex to launch a blockchain as any dropping any new product into a saturated market place.  In general and current market phase, these factors must be executed correctly and in a timely manner; 

a) correct market orientation(reach early adopters), 
b) competent development team,
c) speedy development(MVP),  
d) great documentation, 
e) clear roadmap (strong team lead direction).

- If Verus would become one of the top 50 coins per market cap, then it would have to 20x it¬¥s current value. If your definition of ""life changing money"" is $1 million USD, then you would have to invest $50,000 USD in VerusCoin today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 25 coins per market cap, then it would have to 70x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $14,300 USD today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 10 coins per market cap, then it would have to 240x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $4,200 USD today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 3 coins per market cap, then it would have to 1880x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $532 USD today.
