warning: algo1 community has noticed a big drop in net hash
coinciding with this outage

where is the nethash now?
it was supposed to be 18 TH right?

I find it an interesting ride being a part of this community even still and I have my opinions just like everyone else but I also like to keep an open mind and where some people are anti fpga and some people are pro fpga I am not completely sure where I stand just yet but I will say my concern with the fpga thing is how it might affect not only coin distribution but price if people are able to mine them very cheaply then they are competing against each other to sell them very cheaply keeping the price down which isn't necessarily bad for buyers. It is just a lot of variables and the stakes are somewhat high for some";"";"";
