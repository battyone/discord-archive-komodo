It really screwed a lot of holders over. But I see FPGAs as being very useful for blockchain as a whole moving forward, if they become more common. But small projects that don't actually need the hashrate should try to avoid them if decentralization is intended. At this point in time.

I have purchased an F1 FPGA mainly because it is very similar to GPU's as it can mine many different algo's but much more efficiently. I dont think this is something that can be fought and more time will be spent on ""forking"" and less time will be spent on the actual project. If it aint broke dont fix it. It's like trying to fork away from newer GPU's or CPU's because the hashrate is much higher. Embrace change or you will be left behind and become another project that has no volume.";"";"";
