Still, with deeper analysis, it is also possible to track some funds into the pool and assign probability of those transfers being related to others of similar amounts out shortly after being somehow related. Having both transparent and private addresses makes privacy possible, but unless you have a forced, fully private chain, like Pirate, which then has some challenges with programmability, you may be able to analyze to some degree, unless people are trying to preserve privacy intentionally.";"";"";
