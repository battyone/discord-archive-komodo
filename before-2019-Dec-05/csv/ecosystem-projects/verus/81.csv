These concepts can be useful in finding new solutions and approaches to the inherent problems of maintaining balance in an ideally decentralized market. I don't want to get too hung up on any one fix as I'm sure they all have their trade-offs but I think it's good to consider all the angles. However it goes, I'm confident that because we have a clever and capable team working this out, we'll get the solution that suits us best.";"";"";

ProgPoW ensures that low end commodity CPUs remain relevant for some time, they seem to feel indefinitely. We currently believe our approach solves some issues in a similar way, but others in a way that should be more resistant to bot nets. I'm looking forward to our discussions, and I can always learn. At the same time, I'm feeling pretty good about our approach for the long term. They are open source, and I've already looked through the source.

The goal of ProgPoW isn‚Äôt to resist any kind of hardware, instead, get consistent hash per watt across all hardware types so that one does not have an advantage over another because as soon as one has an advantage all you did was push difficulty up and centralized your hash.

and you are the producers of pieces of iron trying to convince us that we should step aside and hand over to the major miners. Decentralization is, first of all, a more equitable distribution, the participation of all people regardless of their financial situation.

Firstly, I think it would limit the coin income on people using cpus and gpus because it would increase the total hash rate but reduce the hash ratio for cpus and gpus. Secondly, I think it would therefore make it harder to encourage new miners and new members to the community. Thirdly, buying an FPGA for 1 coin is a big and risky investment in my opinion. If verus coin falls then we would have wasted $500. Fourthly, buying verus FPGAs doesn't guarantee that other FPGA makers can make faster FPGAs and therefore make our FPGA useless.

What I'm seeing in these responses is real concern that some early community members or soon to be early community members might still have their on-ramp priced out, and that concerns me a bit. I'm going to do some thinking and coding on the subject.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"09-Dec-18 11:04 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey  @miketout I have some ideas on this. Firstly, I think there are better ways to attract new people, like raindrops and games. I have got so many alt coins of coins I don't even know they are for. And, lots of people have fun chatting on these forums. It's also a great way for us to get other people involved from other forums because everyone want free coins and this would only cost the foundation a few dollars a day. Secondly, I think fpgas being based on multiples of cpu miners will really limit the impact of fpgas on the hash rates because it will chase off the super heavy ROI chasers. Also, people in the community will likely not be coin dumping and therefore driving the coin down. A more stable coin is more attractive and might mean that cpu miners make more money because they Will get less of a ratio of the hash but a coin that has a higher dollar value (assuming u can stop the other fpgas). Thirdly, another way to reduce the risk of fpgas limiting newbies is if the fpgas had other coins that could be mined for a similar level of profit. Forthly, another great way to encourage new people is to host fpgas and buy part of that fpga, like sell 20% for $100. Fithly, another way to help new people is to donate hash to small old cpu miners and gpu miners if they are mining at 100 mhs on and old cpu, you could use part of the fpga farm to give them 200mhs.  Sixthly, lol, I think the biggest problem is not a well devised fpga implementation. The biggest problem is protecting the network from super big and aggressive fpga miners, because they damage the coins stability as well as the community miners. If u can sell fpgas and limit the big fpgas, you got us self a winner. Just my thoughts.";"";"";

I read somewhere that the reward is cut in half every 2 years but for how long?
Apparently half of the reward issued is done through the proof of stake system but is that reward the same as the mining reward? 
As far as I can tell it's just about 25 tokens per block is it the same for proof of stake?
Do you have to have a certain amount in order to participate in the proof of state if so how much? what would be the expected reward? Are there different tiers or does the amount change over time?

Thanks";"";"";
