./verus getnewaddres                                      - to get a new address instead

The coins are basically a collection of balances on the blockchain - a public ledger. Your wallet allows the software to scan the blockchain and figure out which of those balances are yours, and allows you to create a transaction that spends them, using that key, known as the private key.";"";"";
