In any case the time locks will be off after the next having, I believe in about 2-3 weeks. I'm not at my computer, so harder to check at the moment. Once the that happens pools will be much safer and more straightforward, and we expect to see multiple pools pop up. We also intend to have an official pool sorry after that.";"";"";
