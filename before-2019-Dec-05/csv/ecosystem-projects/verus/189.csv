We are trying now to focus on getting finished with PBaaS, as there is a Komodo hard fork in mid July, which we had hoped to upgrade alongside and are not going to, at least partially due to the extra work from the wallet and new coins. That will cost the foundation some amount of Verus directly to maintain uninterrupted notarization and we are not looking for any new work to add before PBaaS is complete.
