There are some large holders of coins, but all holders of coins mined and staked the coins like everyone else. The Verus Coin Foundation is one fairly large holder of coins with a long term goal of realizing the Verus vision expressed in the vision paper and beyond. It currently uses its coins to support people and efforts contributing to realizing the Verus Vision. Other large holders of coins may also choose to offer bounties, and @jl777c has in the past offered bounties for GPU development. As @J Oliver Westbrook said, the community and the Verus Coin Foundation believes the project could use help in marketing and outreach, web development, and core development as well. Feel free to talk about things here or ping me in DM to discuss further.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"02-May-19 01:20 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Guys, thank you for letting the community know about these security issues with other coins,, but unless I'm missing something, and it's relevant to Verus now, can we put those in #off-topic or at least discuss why it is a general discussion topic for Verus? there will never be a shortage of security issues when considering all projects. regarding Duke's statement that Zcash has a DoS vulnerability that he knows how to exploit, but will work on privately if they don't offer a bounty, I only hope and assume that as a Komodo developer, if he knows of something that projects in the Komodo ecosystem are vulnerable to, Komodo would share such a vulnerability with the projects that derive from and have supported them. In any case, we often do our own security analyses, and while we do share any relevant results and ideas to solve them with Komodo and others, we will do more before PBaaS is released. One nice advance related to security in PBaaS is that it already includes header proofs of PoS blocks, which is a new industry-leading solution to the fake stake attacks that cuts them off at the header, before blocks are even considered.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"02-May-19 10:02 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @gigamesh @Oink actually, interchain meta contracts was a reference to the evolution of ccs, so basically yes. Timelocks were implemented before ccs, so they are using bitcoin script style locks, though I believe @jl777c has done some very interesting things with time locked ccs more recently. The challenge in describing the cc technology is that it can be used to actually change consensus rules, which goes beyond smart contracts. add to that the ability to have cross-chain transactions, and it is really something beyond smart contracts as people know them today";"";"";
