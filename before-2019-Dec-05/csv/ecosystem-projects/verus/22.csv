But if the CPU is having to do something that is not native, then the efficiency is just not there.  Your CPU is pre-Sandy Bridge.  I have a Sandy Bridge i7 that is probably one of the first CPU's to have the AVX extension.  It does about 32 Mh/s as compared to 230 Mh/s that a Kaby Lake i7 is doing.

I have been doing that for about 2 weeks and it works like a charm.  It is in the FAQ section.  However, one thing that I found to be easier than what is in the FAQ is to get your public key from the GUI wallet.  It is super easy.  Go to your ""Receive"" section and pick one of your addresses - click the three dot menu to the left of the address and choose 'validate address'.  That will open up a blue/green box that has various data.  near the BOTTOM of that data, just above 'iscompressed: true' is your pubkey.  I found that MUCH easier than typing all of the directories and such in a CMD prompt window.   Once you have your pubkey (do NOT get confused and use the scriptPubKey found near the top of the blue/green box) follow the instruction in the FAQ on how to insert this into the startup command for the CLI miner.";"";"";
