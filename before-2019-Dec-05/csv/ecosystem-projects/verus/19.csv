"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"21-Jul-18 07:15 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> Q: How do I direct all my mined rewards to a single Verus wallet?
A: 
Step 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to:
IN AGAMA GUI
Click ""Receive"", click ""Get New Address"" and choose ""Transparent Address"" from the drop down.
IN VERUS-CLI
You can find an address if you already have previous transactions, or you can create a new one.  To find an address from a previous transaction, use the command line verus listtransactions and copy the address found after ""address"".
To generate a new wallet address, use the command line verus getnewaddress and a new address will be created.

Step 2 - Next, using your new address, enter the command with verus-cli verus validateaddress. From the output find the long string after ""pubkey"", copy without the quotation marks.

Step 3 - Last, use this pubkey when starting your daemon by adding the following line to the end of your command, just before the ""&"" sign: -pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED

Your rewards will now be mined to that address.  It would be a good idea to keep notes and associate the wallet address with the pubkey...also to double check that you did validate the correct pubkey for the wallet address, making sure you made no errors.(edited)";"";"";

1. Includes support for the Electrum changes that recently broke SPV (lite mode) for other coins in our version of Agama. 
2. Includes the new Agama core feature of ""Hide sensitive data"", which obscures amounts and addresses on screen to allow screen shots without exposing sensitive data.
3. We've also added a new capability in our version of Agama only to easily send and receive encrypted memos along with Verus z-transactions, even for a zero amount and just the fee. This allows zero knowledge privacy and strong encryption in sending messages, which we think is pretty cool and useful both now and for applications in the future.
I'm going to announce it as a critical update for both the GUI and command line, which everyone will want to be on by the halving. More details and downloads soon üòÉ";"";"";

What I've heard so far on this work, which is supposed to already be perf optimized to some degree, is that when it is ready, it won't beat CPUs, but if you already have a high end card or two, it will be a nice mining option. it also seems to bottleneck pretty hard on systems with multiple cards or risers, as it is very sensitive to data transfer speeds. still work in progress.";"";"";
