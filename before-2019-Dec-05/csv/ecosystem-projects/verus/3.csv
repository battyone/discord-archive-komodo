One question I have then : are those address derived from main one (the one generated with the priv), or just on the fly generated when mining is succesful : 
Derivative would mean reimporting just the priv could make it, but just on the fly would mean they re just locked in specific wallet.dat, then would have to collect all .dat from multiple mining machines waiting for a possible transfer to T-address.
