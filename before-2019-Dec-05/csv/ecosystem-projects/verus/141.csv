Question: How can I check my immature balance in the Graphic User Interface (GUI version)?

Answer:

In the Agama wallet click on the hamburger menu (the three stripes) on the top right
click on Settings
click on the last item </> CLI
Select VRSC as coin
Type the following command: ""getwalletinfo""
click ""Execute""
scroll down and find ""immature_balance"": which will give you the amount of time-locked coins in your wallet.

```
Question: How do I know when an immature block will ""unlock"" (mature)?

Answer: Follow these steps

Get the values of the current block height (""blocks"") and the ""blockstomaturity"" the distance to maturity of the transaction in question. (i.e. the number of blocks between current block height and where it unlocks. You can see the number is decreasing all the time, and if you add it to the current block height you'll see a constant.)
Apply this formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking) e.g. 925558/1440=643 days
