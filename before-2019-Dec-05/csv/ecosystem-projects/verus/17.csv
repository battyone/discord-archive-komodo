One could value the project and not have to follow the price necessarily. If he's still got coins he would've (might've) sold, he's going to have to be a part of the community longer than he may have planned if he was ""lucky"" enough to get the coins straight off the bat. 

If you are holding coins that you can't touch for 24 months, you probably are going to pay less attention to the price however. It would only be pertinent in the weeks leading up to the unlocking to watch the price. 

I'm here for the project first and foremost, if I get rich at the same time it's a bonus... others, I don't know, but many may see a coin as a coin and an investment opportunity and nothing more. They judge the content and the intent of the coin as part of the valuation of the investment. I really like the dynamic of locked coins though, it's very interesting trying to understand what it means to be involved in a crypto project but not actually have the coin in hand.

As for selling, it's inevitable that over time people will sell some of their holdings. For cash flow, diversification, dealing with debts etc. This way we're just not going to have that leakage in the same way. Although with more users we would hope some would sell to expand the partipant base of the project";"";"";

I'm a little ambivalent for now about promoting as I want to mine more. On the one hand, one can get bounties that will count towards staking, on the other hand, more competition for said staking expansion. Incentives are a bit tricky. However I am looking into what I can do and am spreading the word. 

@englal ðŸ˜ƒ I know what you meant really, I just wanted to be super clear about what was in my mind and do a bit of thinking aloud. I notice it does take some time for the timelock idea to sink in, and then one would have to re-adjust their decision whether to get involved in the project and evaluate their approach.

It is very easy, but you just need to know where to get the privkeys and avoid the mistake of trying to import a list of them instead of one at a time.  I cannot stress that enough - ONE AT A TIME.";"";"";

They did not import and, when I then tried to import them one at a time - they would not import singly either.  I believe the wallet partially imported somehow during the attempt at multiple key importation and that led the wallet to ignore the single key import after that.  I had to restore my wallet.dat to a previous state  before I could get them to import as singles.  @miketout confirmed that the multiple import should be avoided.  Pretty sure that's who it was.";"";"";
