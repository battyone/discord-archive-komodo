"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Feb-19 11:12 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Vycid was thinking about your theory of FPGA purchases redirecting funds that people might otherwise use for buying, and it's actually pretty interesting in a couple ways. First, I agree that at least temporarily, until velocity of the money supply evens it out, it is likely to have such an effect if the sellers then sell Verus and keep none. At the same time, one interesting thought that came to mind is which would get you more mining/staking power, an FPGA for Verus or the Verus itself? Over the long run, the answer should be that you would earn more by spending it to buy the FPGA, or someone else is getting the better deal.";"";"";

I know for sure that the 50/50 split is definitely very supportive of the price. Usually the triple-digit annual inflation rates will sink new coins before they can take off";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Feb-19 11:19 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> There's probably some equilibrium point, where the competition over the hashrate reaches a point where it's better to stake. But every time a new generation of hardware comes out (in this case ASIC) that equilibrium is disrupted and you get some capital outflow";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"25-Feb-19 11:19 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's funny, I was thinking about that too. Staking the same amount of Verus extends the catch up time somewhat. That is a good point you two make, not only are funds temporarily redirected to the device sales but the sellers are going to be converting as well which would have a double whammy effect. Considering this, it isnt too bad a drop and I'll be interested to see as time goes on a likely good rebound effect since things still seem to be holding up pretty well, bear in mind the whole market is a bit wonky at the moment";"";"";
