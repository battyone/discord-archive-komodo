Since the rollout of the pools happened as we were upgrading from 0.3.11, which had been causing people to lag and sometimes fork a little, I believe a fork/reorg happened during that combined upgrade and hash power reallocation that didn't resolve as automatically as it should have. We have a strong main chain, but there seem to be some people on a fork left over from that. I just want to make sure everyone stays productive on the main chain, which is the reason for my announce. If my theory is correct, we basically hit a perfect storm and are still fine, but through an unlikely combination of events, I have figured out how to make the chain completely immune to what may have happened going forward.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"17-Aug-18 08:36 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a Here are the steps...

1. Create a Z address in your wallet - this is a Private Address - NOT to be confused with a private KEY.  Create this in the 'Receive' section of the wallet.
2. Now, go to the SEND section of the wallet and make a new transaction.  When you do this, you will click the button that says ""Shield all recent coinbase transactions"" and input your Z address in the 'send to' line.  There is no need to input the amount.  This will shield ALL unshielded coins.
3. Once that transaction has ONE confirmation, send the coins BACK to a regular Transparent address.  You will click the button that says 'Send from a private address"".  Enter the amount (allow a very small portion for fees) and send the VRSC to your T address (regular transparent address).
4. Wait for 150 confirmations and those coins will be staking.

Q: How to consolidate multiple wallet.dat files in one?
 
Answer:
1) Edit the VRSC.conf file on each instance you have, adding the following line: exportdir=/LOCAL_PATH/ (ie /home/user/)
2) Restart verusd
3) Issue the following command (on the verus-cli): z_exportwallet FILENAME (ie z_exportwallet export_instance01)
4) Copy the generated file to the machine who host your main wallet
5) Issue the following command (on the ""main"" verus-cli): z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME (ie /home/user/export_instance01)";"";"";

make sure that before you do this, you backup all of your wallet files carefully";"";"";

Regarding the fee, that is indicated on the web, if you distribute 90%, then you can say it is 10%, although it is not correct because if they played 4 people or less then I would have to put remaining up to 0.5 VRSC, as indicated on the web.
Also with most of the fee, it would be to build after a faucet and other things related to Verus.
Anyway, people are free to participate or not, I do not intend to swindle anyone 0.1 VRSC, if nobody wants to play, nothing happens. I will close the web and think of another more reliable way to do it.
I hope I have clarified your doubts.
Best regards.";"";"";
