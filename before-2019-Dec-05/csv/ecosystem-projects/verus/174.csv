But I believe the crypto community of today, or that of 6 years ago, can attribute it's major setbacks to one party---the exchanges ... They always seem to be the winner, in crypto. Their outrageous listing fees, trading fees & overall lack of security & or any type of insurance for funds on the exchange.

And when I started reading about Atomic Swaps, I was hooked w/KMD. But it has never really materialized.
Do you think this is something that Verus would be interested, in doing?";"";"";

There is a new decentralized dex for Komodo, and through I haven't used the new one, I'm hopeful. As far as on-chain conversions, we are doing reserve currencies and shared liquidity as a PBaaS liquidity sharing and exchange solution. We expect to still have Verus and other PBaaS coins traded through exchanges and dexes, but with reserve conversion, reserve currencies will share liquidity through cross-chain, decentralized conversions.

I think someone might have linked me the first one at some point actually, but I found the descriptions and examples very handy on getting a good grasp of the concept but if this post is in the wrong place or should be removed I'd be happy to.

Being visible on CMC would be great for marketing. Verus is now on two CMC exchanges, but we need some more trading volume on those before sending in a coin listing submission form to CMC, see this link for more info on CMC listing requirements:

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"08-Jun-19 09:37 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Crupti IMO, I think CMC has to come naturally, for Verus. Every project is different. And some value more aspects than others. 
I know that I personally, when I was very active with Verus, tried to make a case for directing more energy & effort to get listed on CMC. Because it is really the community standard, like BitcoinTalk is for announcing new or newer projects---CMC provides users w/historical price data, current price data, exchanges listings, token supply data, etc ..  It provides some degree of financial legitimiatcy, for new traders to look to, when researching a new project.. Most importantly, it would provide a new wave of community members.

Do you know the required volume & for what period of time? I've got a few things in mind.";"";"";

Links to VerusPay stores have come up before. I‚Äôm positive about it, haven‚Äôt given it much thought yet if, where and how to implement it on the website.

I feel we need build our media efforts towards the release of PBaaS by showing what we‚Äôre capable of at this moment. I‚Äôve had a lot of questions in DM the past couple of days about specifically merge mining and PBaaS and the general conclusion was that those persons had to get some VRSC, as investment or as start capital for a chain.
The fact that out Agama wallet was not vulnerable where the Komodo Agama wallet was and the effort of this community to release 0.5.7 and support the people using it as new replacement wallet, has earned us a lot of goodwill in the entire Komodo ecosystem and a lot of visibility as a result.

The only thing I have to say on verification of developers at this point in the project is similar to to what  @0x03. The constant work being pushed out regularly should be all the verification on the developers work ethics and the cooperation with other communities is a testament to their desire to make positive change to benefit us all. Mike has a long list of public contributions that are easily found. If anything, here, we should respect people's privacy.
I'm not saying this isn't valuable to some and maybe some may choose to add more info at some point, I'm only saying that a full scale merge mineable ecosystem is now coming to fruition and at this point it might be useful to stay focused on the things that are important to everyone.";"";"";
