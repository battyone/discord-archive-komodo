On blockchain compatibility, the core blockchains are generally compatible in many ways that matter, but after the last upstream of Sapling tech, Komodo decided to change blocksize and max tx size in a way that I was not comfortable pushing that quickly into Verus at the time (not criticizing their decision, just was the case at the time). That led to our decision to include 2 daemons in Verus Agama, which allowed us to support all coins natively while focusing on interoperability vs equivalene. Since that time, we released further enhancements to custom consensus processing, VerusHash 2.0, the nothing at stake solution, and the newest Verus Proof of Power that was the mathematcially provable 51% hash attack resistant update, which with Komodo-notarized projects is a bit less important.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"10-Jun-19 07:29 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For PBaaS, we changed the header meaningfully for merge mining, merkle mountain range proofs, and header-based proof against targeted fake-stake header attacks, another industry solution that we just haven't talked about yet. We also changed the coinbase and extra-nonce to make it so that coinbases can include an instant-spend form of output that enables PBaaS notarization competition and will also enable reserve currency conversion on chain in a way that solves front-running. This is a lot of detail on things that will also be in PBaaS and have not been written up yet, but that is a basic set of differences, which are fairly substantial. At the same time, there is compatibility in notarized, cross-chain transactions and much of the enhancements to things like CCs and even notarization benefits can be pulled upstream at some point. PBaaS itself requires some significant changes, so it may be more a Verus thing for some time, hence the primary goal is full interoperability over equivalence.";"";"";

This new proof in PoS headers after the PBaaS upgrade will allow headers to efficiently prove their PoS validity and be quickly invalidated as appropriate before ever being considered as a potentially valid entry.";"";"";
