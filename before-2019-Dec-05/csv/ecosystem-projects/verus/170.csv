1. Close Komodo Agama
2. Rename the wallet.dat in the ~/.komodo folder to wallet-old.dat and the wallet.dat in the ~/.komodo/VRSC and ~/.komodo/PIRATE folder  (or other komodo family chains) to wallet-old.dat
3. Load Verus Agama wallet. Make sure before you do that all folders of coins do not have a wallet.dat file in them.
4. Activate each coin and create the addresses to send to. Copy them to some editor, so you can send to them
5. Close Verus Agama
6. Rename all wallet.dat files in all directories to wallet-new.dat
7. Rename all wallet-old.dat files in all directories to wallet.dat
8. Load Verus Agama
9. Send all funds to the new addresses on each coin
10. Close Verus Agama
11. Rename all wallet-new.dat files to wallet.dat
