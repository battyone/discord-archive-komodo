Anyway, #announcements explains what the teams considers best. There's nothing strange to it. It's how blockchains work. The work is open source and can be forked to whomever's liking. But for obvious reasons you'd do best in following the development team's fork, and in that case the development team can be considered the centralized part of a project. And lastly, it's not about banning fpga:s, it's about leveling the playing field in this point in time, mostly until fpgas become more common(decentralized). (As I interpret it)";"";"";

The issue isnt about stopping anybody and as gloryman said, it is mostly about leveling the playing field and as jl777c said fpga currently have over 50x lead meaning more coins going to a few. This leads to centralization. A group decision is not centralization. If you've been following in here lately, you will find the community is very much united on most of these matters and from the frequent updates and inquiries by Mike and the dev team it leads me to believe that they are flexible and open minded.

Not being particularly knowledgeable about the dynamics of mining and all of the different strategies, I don't see how FPGAs could ever be a part of the Verus community.  The goal here is to keep processors of  any type as equitable as possible.  This goes against what the FPGA is supposed to do -- do something extraordinarily fast.  Right?  So with this in mind, I would expect that once the fork comes out, maintain parity between the CPU and GPU as before and lock out the FPGAs enough that there is no incentive to use them anymore.  FPGAs can target other coins.   Or maybe there's something in between where a new algo requires CPU users to get any cheap GPU to use functions that make it impossible for FPGAs?  I don't know, just wondering actually.";"";"";

I have been following this project since before launch. I read the available docs before launch. The team has done nothing but overdeliver on their promises so far, and they are staying true to the vision.
I believe you need the history lesson since you can't be bothered to check your facts before you throw criticism at the team.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"12-Dec-18 05:41 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> Just my two cents. Why not look at what Nexus did and make different hashing channels for different types of devices. CPUs have their own hashing channels and then GPUs also have their own hashing channels so they don't have to compete against each other. Of course you can always group the fpgas with the gpus or make third channel.";"";"";
