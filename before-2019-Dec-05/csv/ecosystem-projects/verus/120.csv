"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"27-Feb-19 10:22 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> -PBaaS: or Public Blockchain as a Service is a revolutionary new take on the blockchain as a service model entirely unique to Verus that offers the tools and necessary means to build on and utilize blockchain technology for business or personal use. It is similar to using a web hosting service to build a website with, but rather than having to build one by yourself from scratch, the service provider supplies the basics and handles all the necessary tasks from general upkeep to infrastructure maintenance. Since Verus doesn't rely on a centralized authority to work, there isn't any one single point of failure in the network, so in the event of a hack, power failure, data breach or loss, Verus' system is immune while the other options aren't. Instead of relying on a centralized system, Verus elegantly does work for the public by utilizing the public to do work.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"28-Feb-19 02:22 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jl777c IMO, with the delegation approach, it comes down to a decision of whether the loss of decentralization from delegation would be worth the convenience. Some projects do allow delegating your coins only for the purpose of staking, which would be pretty easy with CC's, as I guess you might be thinking with the leasing idea. I've also seen critiques of the centralization of these projects that are hard to argue with. I think there's a real security benefit to having all general users of Verus who have a PC staking as much as possible. I guess doing it with delegation might tend to centralize to the same or close to the same entities as pools and farms, which seems to reduce at least some of the security benefit you get from a hybrid algorithm.";"";"";
