I'm not a tech person, so indulging my ignorance: 1. what benefit I am receiving from staking VRSC on the agama wallet? And 2. On avg, how often can I expect to get a block reward from mining w the agama wallet (approx 83 mega hash/s)? And finally, 3. I'm mining/staking w agama, but also purchase from DP occasionally- do I have to update my staking each time I add more VRSC from DP, or is the TOTAL in my agama wallet automatically staked?

2. Take your hashes / network hashes to get a rough estimate of your chance to mine. 
3. If you're staking with a wallet, any public (non-Z address keyed) VerusCoins you've moved in will be staked.";"";"";

""there is an Agama mobile wallet available for Android now, which supports Verus, and once we get past the Sapling activation, which includes pool, electrum, and lite mode updates still to happen, we will focus on completing a very nice React Native mobile wallet that is already in the works and will have a number of unique features that we believe will make a difference, can't talk about specifics quite yet or when.""";"";"";
