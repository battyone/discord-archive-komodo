Exactly 1 year ago I had a bad experience with Craptopia when they took all trading pairs for coins besides BTC down for three months. Shady.. plus rumors about what they do with POS and MN coins -- They would stake all the coins under the one wallet for the coin... and not remove them from staking till someone physically move the coins off the exchange. That can have evil effects on a POS coin. How decentralized is that anyways? If you are a POS or MN coin you are better off sticking to DEX's where that trick is not possible.  Good decision there!! Go VERUS! üòÉ";"";"";

Taking what you get back, add it to CB funding and disassociate  Verus from Cryptopia completely.  What Cryptopia had happen is not what a new coin wants happening from the start.  Stick with the DEX's  P2P is what it always should have been.";"";"";

All listing a POS coin on a non-P2P exchange does  is devalue the staking coin and centralize it at the same time. All the coins they make is pure profit...and you then can imagine what they could do with price manipulation or when they ""Sell"" all of those staked coins.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"16-Jan-19 11:32 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> @Godballz , it can be major to a new coin that is only listed or first listed on a non DEX...I've seen it happen multiple times now.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"16-Jan-19 11:40 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not sure which Exchange is being leaned towards or what the best reasons for choosing one would be.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"16-Jan-19 11:41 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So if that's the only reason and the cheaper or free one would be a good option but if that's not the only reason and I would guess that it's always better to have multiple reasons then it might be better to pay the fee and go for the bigger one but if there are free options I guess more than one choice is also possible";"";"";

On non-DEX exchanges you would have to add all the coins on the exchange up for Sell orders to understand the size of their wallet in coins that they could potentially stake.  Bigger non-Dex  exchange you get the worse it gets and the faster the coin is devalued.
