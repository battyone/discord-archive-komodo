1. We have identified a few small issues while running under Sapling on mainnet. None of them are serious, and we will address all in the next few days. The relevant one here is that currently all stakes are being delegated to a new address that would have been the address when you are mining. Until the next update, POS does not respect -pubkey and will payout to new addresses as if mining without pubkey
2. The code base should allow Equihash + VerusPOS after integration. Someone would have to do some work and understand the new chain power rules to add other POW algorithms, but VerusPOS doesn't really know or care what the specific POW algorithm is.";"";"";

AFAIK, StakeGuard works is by spending the cheater coins when they mature to your cheat catch S-address, so my conclusion is that the immature coins that go to a T-address can't be the result of cheat catch and are just a regular stake. I have no idea why the Z-transaction is there, though";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"31-Oct-18 11:00 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jimboscott right. the issue is that the OP_RETURN of the stake transaction is showing up as a 0 amount transaction and because Agama doesn't know the destination (there is none), it assumes unknown Z. for the point release, I am adding information to the transactions that indicate whether they are stake transactions, mined coinbases, or minted coinbases. getting this information took more API calls before than it will after this change. Verus Agama will use this to collapse all the stake ins and outs into one, obvious ""stake"" transaction that shows the amount. We also expect to differentiate between mined and minted.";"";"";
