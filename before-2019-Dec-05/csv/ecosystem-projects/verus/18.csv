Hash rate is a measurement of mining activity, basically one guess at winning a block. The hash rate of your miners can be compared to the total network hash rate to estimate the likelihood of your winning a particular block. See FAQ for how to do that calculation.";"";"";

there was so much pessimism for a while...

I reckon anyone who has any strategic thinking ability at all (which is likely to be anyone who was mining from early) will not be looking to dump, but there may be some loosening of the early coins into the market as they just do have less relative value to early miners/stakers who may feel they have commited enough and might need some money.

Reclassifying contractor/employee relationships is tricky.

Are the two CPU's identical or just both i7's?   I have an i7 in one of my old desktops that pulls about 40 mh/s and another doing 230.  The difference there is the generation of the CPU and perhaps some chipset limitations too.";"";"";

Are they networked via WiFi or ethernet/hard-wired? If the latter, try switching connections between the two and see if the slow hash follows.

Either WiFi or ethernet: You can try:
```ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew```
to get a new lease and see if that is the culprit.

Finally, try stopping Agama on the slow laptop, let it exit completely, shut the machine down (rather than just re-starting), start the machine and than try loading and running Agama again. This has usually worked for me.";"";"";

Taken from my #faq-chosen "" So, once your coins loose their time lock, in the GUI first generate a private address and then go to the ‚ÄûSend‚Äú screen and use ‚ÄûShield a coinbase transaction‚Äú (will take some time, likely 5 min, but may be up to 20 min, much longer than from a public/transparent address to another). Finally you transfer the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you‚Äôll automatically start staking.""";"";"";
