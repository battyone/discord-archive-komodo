If we want to have coinbase transactions shielded as quickly as possible and not held in a transparent address, maybe we can come up with a way to reward people for making a transaction within a certain amunt of time rather than a time-lock loss. It might be an interesting exercise as I am not aware of any other chains that do this so it would be another unique feature of pirate.  It would be very interesting to see how it works out.  We have Masternodes, staking, interest etc...but no reward for shielding. Maybe something like reward a full coinbase utxo transaction with 1% of the amount if transacted to a zaddr withing XX blocks of when it was mined? It would increase the total supply and emission, but would be very interesting aspect as the halvings progress";"";"";
