arcane = understood by few, so it goes with ""basic""   make a wallet that a peson new to cryptocurrency can understand.  

github is not currently consistent, in terms of where the pirate wallets are.  As I mentioned, the sevenseas on piratenetwork git doesn't work. 

I'm really not talking about microshaft in this instance, but predictable still applies. No matter the platform, the install process should be similar. 

And this is all coming from a perspective that I'm happy to help where I can, but I'm not a coder. I'm not trying to argue; I hope my answers give my perspective clearly.";"";"";

ZCoin employs Proof of Work with the Lyra2 algorithm, and has a total supply of 21.4 million coins. XZC uses the zerocoin algorithm, which essentially works by ‚Äúburning‚Äù a coin (and its history), and ‚Äúminting‚Äù a new coin. Zerocoin has its merits, however, it does not hide the transaction value. Moreover, zerocoin minting is an optional feature for ZCoin. At the time of this writing, less than a 10% of ZCoin‚Äôs transactions use minted coins. This leaves over 90% of the transactions as datapoints for chain analysis and reverse transaction lookup. ZCoin transactions hide the sender‚Äôs identity, however, receiver addresses and the transaction values are broadcast on the blockchain, this is only pseudo-privacy.";"";"";
