The thing is this is how the parameters of this chain are written. It is exactly how it is suppose to work. Mining to a zaddr is not a goo idea because it adds some protection  to know everytime a coinbase is created. So the current setup is good. If we do not want people to keep coinbase rewards in the  transparent mining address we should create a rule that all coinbase rewards must be moved to a z addr within XX blocks or the balance is sent to me :P. My point is, I agree with you, but the owner of that address is using it in the EXACT way that the parameters of the chain dictate and creating a bounty to discover the owner seems to go against the principles of pirate, IMHO.";"";"";
