I think listing on exchanges is some of the best marketing for us. Possibly a few thousand crypto users will read the announcement of the listing and maybe look closer into ARRR (either because they want to make quick bucks from price swings at listing or to check if it is an interesting project). e.g. I have only heard about ARRR from the cryptobridge listing, if it wasn't listed there I would have likely still not heard about ARRR.";"";"";

Purse.io is a different format,  haven’t used it in awhile but if I remember right it’s a matching service, it doesn’t do the exchange from crypto to fiat itself";"";"";

Might be good idea for me to investigate it.";"";"";

When she goes she leaves behind dreams
Where she dances time no longer exists
She’ll steal all your stories off into the mists

From her sparkly toes to the tips of her wings
To her voice sweetly trilling as she softly sings
To see her is to love her with all of your soul
To love her is to let her devour you whole

Good night, sleep cozy, dream of falling in love
Dream of dragon pirates plaguing the stars above
Dream of heists, of adventures, of running away
Of anything, everything, except that you’re prey``";"";"";
