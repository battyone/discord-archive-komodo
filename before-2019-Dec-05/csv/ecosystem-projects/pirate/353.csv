Them maybe we can choose which one we want to talk about in the video and then we can develop more on those reasons by adding concrete examples.

1-Fungibility 
To remove power from anyone to blacklist coins or addresses.

2-Business privacy
To keep negociation power with vendors and clients.

3-No Big Brother
We don’t want governement of corporation to monitor our every move and we don’t want to be subject to eventual persecution resulting from such monitoring.

4-No Mishandling of data.
If the data is not leaked in the first place, then there is no mishandling of that data possible (Facebook-Cambridge Analytica). If we let suposedly trustable governement or company handle our private data, there is always a risk for the data to fall in the wrong hands by hacking or just plain incompetence.

5-Keeping control of our wealth.
Removing control from bank on our wealth. Being our own bank to remove the power from anyone to freeze our accounts.";"";"";

3-No financial Big Brother nor Big Data (preventing financial data collection)
We don’t want governement of corporation to monitor our every financial move and we don’t want to be subject to eventual persecution resulting from such monitoring. If the corporations are so eager to collect social media data massively, they will be even more for your financial data which misuse can be even more troublesome.

5-Fully reclaiming or financial sovereignty.
Removing control from bank on our wealth. Being our own bank to remove the power from anyone to freeze our accounts.

6-Risk of robbery.
 If ledgers are public, robbers can monitor them to help them find who to rob.
