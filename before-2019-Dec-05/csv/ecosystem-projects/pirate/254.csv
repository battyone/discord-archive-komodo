I ve been mining for 3 days using the same Z-Address. My wallet is installed on my desktop computer at home and i’m traveling but i bring one notebook with me cause i have to do some OTC sells. So i installed Agama wallet, activated Pirate chain and waited it to sync. After syncing i wrote down my WIF key from the address i’m mining to and nothing appeared in my balance, i couldn’t click on send buttom and i couldn’t see any of my incoming transactions from the pool neither the ones i sent to the buyers... Than i wrote here and someone asked me to Rescan the wallet, I did and appeared some balance and only the transaction history from 14 hours ago until now, but i vê been using this address for more than 2 days and there are plenty more transactions than it’s showing there... Like it’s showing only data from the time i installed the wallet on this other computer.. As i already said, when i left home i check wallet balance and paid balance on pool, and it was like 1800 on wallet and 6.8k on pool. Now it’s 13K on pool and 2.5k on wallet..";"";"";
