As I know, mining for truly decentralized projects is intended for a wide range of people, because many do not have the money for large farms or the purchase of FPGAs. For them, there is a POS where each holder of a small amount of coins can be rewarded,
the same situation with the GPU, which provides for the creation of a community of a wide range of people, even for those who can afford to buy no more than one farm. If the project wants ASIC or FPGA there are no problems, their right and opinion is that they are more efficient means of mining,
but let them not be surprised by the circle of large holders and the sharp drops in the price of a coin, because the ASIC miner's task is to discourage the investment until his ASIC as L +, D3 has turned into a useless piece of iron. But if they are counting on attracting a wide mass of people, they should be POS and not Masternodes, there should be a GPU and not FPGA or ASIC.
It's my opinion";"";"";
