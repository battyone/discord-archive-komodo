I'm not sure of the inherent value in that mess (massive premine that may or may not be burned at will, easy to dominate hash with an FPGA, and a very specific use-case that revolves around a specific segment of a specific industry being involved with little platform dev to that end)

LUMBER is 50% Proof-of-Stake so no chance of a 51 attack. 300,000 LUMBER has been burned from the pre-mine with more to come. Total circulation is  2,000,000 which is really low with a 21,000,000 max. Most coins don't even come close to those metrics. As for use case, it is true that the emphasis is on solving problems for the forest products industry, but the tech can also be applied to trading, insurance and other financial products that are industry related. Add to that energy efficiency, GPU utilization and a strong brand name, you can see why it gets H8.";"";"";
