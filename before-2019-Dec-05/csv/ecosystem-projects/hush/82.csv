"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"13-May-19 12:01 AM";"[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @Zatoichi   My post was relevant to your description, it just required some thought  and further education on your end.  BTCP was a fork of ZCL.  In my opinion, ZCL was a copy and paste job  of Zcash by, and again in my opinion, some of the greatest scammers in crypto, eg Rhett Creighton and company (he copied Zcash in its entirety and removed a few line of codes, eg the founders fee, and used envy tactics to convince people that legitimate developed like Vitalik were scamming them with the fee to get victims do dump money into his project).  BTCP was a straight copy of ZCL without much further development in my opinion. There was potentially much more fraudulent activity with respect to BTCP, eg the code had an ‚Äúaccidental flaw‚Äù that resulted in ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù taking advantage of the premine and generating 2 million coins out of nowhere and cratering the price of BTCP.  On this front alone BTCH is superior to BTCP.  No such vulnerability exists in BTCH.

So when you reference technology in relation to BTCP and any coin with any legitimate development, eg BTCH, it sounds suspect to me and it sounds like you may not be aware what you are comparing it to.   BTCH may or may not be dead, but comparing it to something that has almost no technical development of any kind and was probably created with the pure and unadulterared intent to scam people, ie BTCP, is unfair and incomplete.

The net of it is that BTCH has several technical features that BTCP does not have, but that isn‚Äôt saying much.  You implied further development was required for it to catch up. There‚Äôs nothing to catch up to.

Of course, this post is my opinion and should not be interpreted as a statement of fact. If I am wrong on anything I am saying, those with more knowledge can correct me.";"";"üíØ (1)";
