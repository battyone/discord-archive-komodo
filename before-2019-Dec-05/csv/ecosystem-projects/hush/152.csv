"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"16-Jul-19 01:28 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @anglersec historically, Bitcoin ruled the crypto world. In 2017, with the creation of ethereum contracts that let anybody mint coins, a massive shift occured. People with the know-how created new coins and marketed the living crap out of them. Then the world saw and bought them- only to realize they have no use case as ERC20 tokens. It was all a big sham (or at least 99% of it was). What we are seeing now, is the dumping of all those ERC20's and Bitcoin dominance rising to levels we havent seen in over 2 years. Is it painful? Yes. But it is also an opportunity";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"16-Jul-19 01:31 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> But rest assured- once Bitcoin rallies past its ATH of $20k (19.8 if you wanna be technical) the world will once again FOMO into bitcoin and send it to unimaginable heights (50-100k in my opinion). After this occurs, pepole who are new to crypto will see that some altcoins go up faster than bitcoin does, until the FOMO from Bitcoin transfers to the FOMO of altcoins just like the end of 2017";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"16-Jul-19 02:08 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My focus is on increasing the price of Hush via making it useful, it's an ""application coin"", you use it do something, that is it's first reason to have value. Owning Hush = the ability to communicate privately, now and in the future. So you can also think of it as a ""Store-of-Privacy"". That is how it gets intrinsic value, in my mind.
