Cryptopia is bankrupt. The ""Liquidator"" company will sell all crypto that was held on Cryptopia and then it will pay out everyone (in BTC or USD... who knows) after deducting the stolen part, so everyone will get less, even if only the ETH was stolen.
Does this mean that we will see a huge amont of crypto being sold in the market on other exchanges soon? ... I can't believe how they can sell 2-300k HUSH ...the other exchanges doesn't have that volume. It would totally crash the price.";"";"";

The liquidators will also need to be paid which is probably the biggest expense.
