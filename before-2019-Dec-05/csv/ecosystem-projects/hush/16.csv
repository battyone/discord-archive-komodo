I hate to say this, but HUSH used to have a ""marketing team"" and they were telling us for the last 1 year!! that it doesn't make sense to market a product until it's released. Now it's released, but the marketing team is long gone :D
I'm not trying to bash anyone about this, but saying that it's a community project is like pointing fingers to nowhere.
Noone in the community will want to put in serious effort in Marketing as most of us only own a small amount of HUSH, so there is no  incentive to do it. And the community does not have access to make changes or post on the twitter account, website, facebook page, etc.

I think we are back to the orignal problem. That is: there is no budget for anything as the mining rewards go 100% to the miners.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:30 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> To my knowledge, Hush-NG is going to be a new interface which is very simple to use. New GUI that the ordinary consumer is able to use. Right now the swing wallet is only for the hardcore fans";"";"";

That would solve all the problems this project has.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:31 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Also, since @dukeleto is part of the core Komodo team, he has tons of connections that will surely be able to help us down the road in  releasing said GUI. The lead dev on Komod is @jl777c  who i believe is the single largets holder of Hush";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:32 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> The mining rewards is a question that im unable to answer unforutnatley. I do agree that a ""founders reward"" of some sort would be helpful. For example in Bitcoin Hush (BTCH) they are implementing staking and will stake the BTCH founders bag in order to earn rewards which could then be used to pay devs just like founders rewards would";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:33 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Yes, the strong relations with the Komodo team is a very big plus for HUSH. May be the single biggest reason to invest in this project.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:34 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> I would 100% agree";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:34 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Hush takes a back seat to the KMD ecosystem as that is always the first priority.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:34 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> its just a matter of patience";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:36 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> With Cryptopia not updating to HUSH 2.0 is has been furstrated for lots of Hodlers b/c it looks like the project is at a standstill.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:37 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> Cryptopia will update their wallet sooner or later. I'm not worried about that part.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:39 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> The thing is: If they want to delist HUSH because it has low volume, they would still need to update and fix the wallet first so people can withdraw their HUSH. But if they put effort in it, then it actually doesn't hurt to keep it. Especially if dPow protects the chain. So I'm not worried about getting delisted. It's just a matter of time until trading will be enabled again.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"26-Oct-18 02:40 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Most definitely. The update will come- but we are working hard to get listed on another exchange so we dont have to rely on one central exchange again";"";"";
