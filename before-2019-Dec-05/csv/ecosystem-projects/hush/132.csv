The downside to implementing a private address (whether it be via NFC, engraving, etc) is that most of the options would expose your private key to a third party, which to me, raises security concerns that I personally don't like and/or will make the coin look really tacky (specifically with implementing NFC).

As far as public addresses via engraving the address or QR code, i'm not opposed to it, but I do see some pitfalls. One of which, is if for some reason your address gets compromised, now you have a useless address/QR code on a coin. The other, being price. To get a unique QR code printed on every coin would drive up the price significantly (unless I can find someone to do the laser engraving for cheaper) and would also require that everyone who purchases a coin do the same (which, if I get enough interest and pre-orders for a coin specifically with this purpose, i'm all for it)";"";"";
