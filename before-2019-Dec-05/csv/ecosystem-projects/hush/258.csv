When you are the only liquidity provider for a LN node, you can increase fees. When there are many liquidity providers, fees market apply and each node will lower its fee to route the payment. We can go below minimum (devs exchanged 1 sat many times with 0 fee offchain).
About centralization and decrease of privacy, I d be happy to read a paper on it. Last time I discussed LN with kmd guys, they were not aware of all developments since years and they pretended to have read the code. I was able to discuss LN with jl777: all concerns about LN are known by LN community, documented and some PhD thesis are written. In all LN docs that I read, they explains that it is not designed for big amounts.
I think that some cooperation might be possible in order to support crypto space.
About privacy, they are building onion routing and such things (nearly 0 privacy feature are released), cooperation can help every crypto.";"";"";

I don t understand what you said about fee onchain vs offchain. On LN, it the only route to pay your invoice is too expensive, you can establish anew channel more direct, fee competition can begin (in a far future). I don t remember that guys want higher fees on LN compared to onchain. If you want to send a huge amount on LN, it is normal to create a direct channel to set low fees. But today, huge amounts are at risk on LN (it is known by everyone in the LN channels wherd I am)
LND is 1 of the 3 big implementations where there are 6 to 9 implementations (I played with c lightning and LND. Chips is based on an oldc lightning)";"";"";
