As you all know, since the Cryptopia disaster Hush has been limited to one exchange (tradesatoshi) where volumes have been fairly low. Some of the most common comments we see in this discord are the need to be on more exhanges. We have applied to every well known exchange but do not often hear back. Recently, we have been in contact with CryptoBridge who has offered to list us on their exchange (for a fee of course). Their current daily volume is around 400k USD (per CMC) which is actually only half of TradeSatoshi. If getting listed on CryptoBridge is something that we as a community would like to do, then we need to raise 2.5 BTC in order to get the listing. However, if everyone would rather wait & see if we can find a better deal at a higher volume exchange, then that is fine with us as well. If you are willing to contribute BTC to help Hush get listed on crypto Bridge, please THUMBS UP this comment. If not, please voice your opinions as such. This is a community project and we're all decision makers here. So let us know what you think!";"";"";

They evaluate each coin individually based on the paperwork that you provide them. We would need a legal opinion as well as token metrics done by a law firm in order to submit to Bittrex and have any real shot of getting a listing. The Lawyer fees for such work is around 6k USD";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Jan-19 04:04 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <Francis> @RunningMantheCoin so if the legal feels are 6k usd for potential listing at bittrex (which is going to have to be required in the future if hush wants to grow substantially) and cryptobridge want 2.5btc (What $8k?)

I'm asking because I could potentially fund the legal costs of listing, though I would choose btch over hush";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Jan-19 04:07 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> That is correct, BTCH inherits all the KMD updates automatically";"";"";

However in order for us to have a shot at the Bittrex listing, we would also need a Whitepaper for HUSH. At the moment, there is only a whitepaper for the HushList protocol- whereas we need one specifically for the coin. The law firm would then take that whitepaper and edit it so it can follow all necessary legel jargon & avoid being looked at as a security";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Jan-19 04:18 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Francis my task has been specifically to find out what the needs are in order to get HUSH listed on exchanges. Since Hush and BTCH are seperate coins, then yes they would each need to be paid for seperately. However, the short term issue with trying to get BTCH listed is there is very little paperwork or online forums that talk about the coin. Hush has a much larger history (bitcointalk forums, huge Github, large twitter acccount, good website etc). So functionally speaking, there is a much higher chance of getting Hush listed on an exchange than BTCH simply because of the sheer work that BTCH needs in order to catch up to HUSH";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"29-Jan-19 04:19 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> And moreover you are correct, the difference between large exchanges and small ones is that small ones ask for a fee for a guarenteed listing. We could hypothetically spend all this money on HUSH to get it listed but it may not be acceptd.

And kmd is already listed/ decent website/ publicity - KMD could promote/ link itself to BTCH (which I believe KMD is going to be reliant upon in the future anyway?)

I am a long term invested in all three, KMD, HUSH & BTCH, as I truly believe in their tech - though I never wished to be involved with funding.

2019 I will help with KMD & BTCH publicity, which I should have a great influence on.
