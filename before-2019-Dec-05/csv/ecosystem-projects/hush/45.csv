The move is great in terms of you being a core dev of KMD and maintenance wise its worth it, but the goal of Hush from the actual devs was way different. I respect your decision and hope hush have a better future.
As a investor its cheaper for me to hire a team to create KMD AC from scratch and even implement HushList then me investing into Hush. But as innovation there already 10's of project that did it already. So its not adding anything to the ecosystem and its just a clone project.";"";"";

I offered to make fork Hush in which the developer’s remuneration would be provided for, just do it, nobody will mind. You did not express any opinion on this matter and were silent, say so, say: Yes, my team and I will work for a reward from each unit. What is the problem with this? As for the BTCH. Like many BTCH holders, I bought even more coins in anticipation of a POS reward. Your team has a big deposit BTCH, why delay the process? You do not need money? Do not all businesses immediately bring money, or do you not see the prospect of earning money from POS? Why am I asking about BTCH? You yourself wrote that by Q1 the Verus algorithm will be launched. Note no one forced you to write about it. OK, POS is missing. Write about this, sorry guys POS BTCH is postponed because I am busy with HUSH, but you are silent and do not tell until you ask. Therefore, we worry.
