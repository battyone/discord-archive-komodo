Deal with it. Also I don't think you're rich, people who're staying here are the ones who missed all the trains or the ones who're legitimately contributing. Seeing that you were on FIX and others, I'm not sure you're contributing to anything. And to be clear, I never got burned because of your advices, I never followed these, but I found it pretty bold that you still dare to hang around after all your unethical ""marketing"" during the bullrun. But hey, I guess the moon isn't here yet. I'm not salty about you helping scammers, I'm disapointed to see you still alive. And amused to be able to say you're still stuck here ðŸ˜‰";"";"";
