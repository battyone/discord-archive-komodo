Since it was done after the help given to the zcl team with their tech, and zcl went up, so folks expected the btch (as it was positioned by the creators) to be sort of btcp rival, taking into account that there was some roadmap produced and so on. In my definition, the scam is something that is positioned as something of significant value, useful, competing with some similar or inferior tech, but then after all those promises, basically put off and forgotten. So, if btch is developed with the original positioning and also plans, then it is a valid tech, but if it is from the serious considerations by the devs, then how would you otherwise call, to be fully honest? Scam does not consist in being given free coins, but in not following on one's promises and evident implications. If you remember, the Bitcoin Hush was positioned in those days so highly so that the folks were even wondering if hush is going to be developed further, or if everyone will turn to develop btch.";"";"";

However, it’s not a scam. There was massive incompetence by the team during the fork that lead to a massive price dump, and I think the original founders knew it was a coin they could pump and dump (which they did on an overly enthusiastic crypto market).  It was a ruthless move, but HUSH is real and has real functionality.  Whether it succeeds or not long term is another question.  It’s going to be tough for any small market coin to pump during this run because you have to be on the legitimate exchanges for that to happen, which is going to be tough for a coin  that has some negative history.

ZCL and BTCP were legitimate scam coins in my opinion. I believe the people that many people involved  with that project were definitively scammers and possibly real criminals.   In my opinion, BTCP especially is one of the greatest scams in the crypto space.   It’s absolutely incredible what those mfers pulled off.

I remember Duke making strong implications to folks not to invest in that project, and many ignored his words of caution (myself included) to their extreme detriment.
