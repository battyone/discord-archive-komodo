I also updated the explorer.hush.zelcore.io to my recent insight style. So it has pools, rich list, some statistics, fixes etc. It will take a while for the mongodb to catch up but should be working. The source is in hush branches in TheTrunk/bitcore-node-hush TheTrunk/insight-api TheTrunk/insight-ui . I will be trying to do some unification of inisght explorer so for there is just bitcore-node.json file when you write: coin: hush and it will configure itself for hush coin, or zcash or whatever. Will be nice to have this a bit centralized for all new coins as well";"";"";
