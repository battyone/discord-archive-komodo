Seems, just to add this memo with the owner's will is not enough because it is not clear for the Heir cc how to fulfill  the conditions in this memo. Now Heir cc contract unconditionally allows to spend the funds for the heir, if inactivity time is passed.
If we want to add some real world will, seems, we need who would execute its conditions. That is, we probably need 3-rd person, an executor of the will. He should add his signed permission to spend funds from our 1of2 cryptocondition where the funds are.";"";"";
