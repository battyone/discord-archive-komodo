was also thinking about adding images, I see 2 ways:
-either adding the images url directly to the tokens description
-or use an existing back-end API, extract images out of it based on the tokens ID.
btw tokens that I created on MORTY are Pok√©mon, & I'll use a Pok√©mon api to attach images to them";"";"üí• (2)";

```
komodo-cli -ac_name=MORTY tokeninfo ""fc658af6364f80f76f7ef92e18303ebae91b8d076757c624c7653710a7887b29""

We can attach meta data to the tokens at their creation.

The maximum size of data that can fit in a single Komodo transaction is 10000 bytes. This is enough to include all sorts of data, and even simple images.

The developer is naturally free to use their imagination in the design of this data. For example, you can describe their purpose and add a json data structure that informs other software of the properties of this token.

Advanced developers can even add functionality to allow the tokens to gain new data over time as they are passed through transactions.```";"";"";
