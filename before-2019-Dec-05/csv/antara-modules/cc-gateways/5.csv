I've already read it, and what I understood is that the gateways are based on multisig, i.e. that one can withdraw from a gateway only if the owner/owners of the gateway let him to. Have I understood right?";"";"";

It can be tricky to get your head around, but there is a walkthrough on the dev docs site.";"";"";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"15-Oct-19 04:03 PM";"@johnwhitestar Yes, gateway can be multisig but it also can be single signature. The point with multisig is to make the deposit and withdraw as decentralized as possible. The idea for some gateways that will be ran on KMD asset chains is that notary nodes (which are trusted as they do the dPoW) also run oraclefeed which is responsible for posting external chain block data and responsible for withdraws. For example it will be gateway with 7of15 signatures necessary for withdraw or even more.";"";"";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"15-Oct-19 04:05 PM";"Single signature gateways is basically centralized as you are puting trust in one point that can become corrupted, and you are throwing away all the point of blockchain. But probably there will be cases for single sig gateways.";"";"";

I'm thinking to create ""smart tokens"" based on KMD for a currency I'm quite involved in. So that currency would acquire off-chain KMD CC functionality. For that reason I'd need a gateway from and into KMD for that currency. But of course if it's just me who guaranties that gateway it's doesn't look out serious. Can I use KMD notaries for that purpose then, right? So there are automated 15 signatures to guaranty withdrawals from the gateway, am I understanding it right?";"";"";
