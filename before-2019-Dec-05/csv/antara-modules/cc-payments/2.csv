I have got payments CC working to be paid by the miner. My parameters of my plans in this chain are stupid, but the important thing to do was to fund the contracts. You can use the notes here as a guide to create your own chains:
https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo/blob/489485252b68597bc9173328ed21674b58f90b8b/src/cc/hempcoin_notes.txt
The branch you need for now is: `git clone https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo.git -b jl777` 
I will merge this to jls repo once it has had some more testing. I think I covered every base, such as creating diffrent ac_script/ac_pubkey chains to make sure all coinbases were paid to the right pubkeys etc, but its possible I have missed something, its been a long 2 days. 
You can sync the chain I created in the example with that branch by running the following command:
`./komodod -ac_name=TESTHC -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=100000000000 -ac_cc=2 -ac_script=2ea22c8020987fad30df055db6fd922c3a57e55d76601229ed3da3b31340112e773df3d0d28103120c008203000401ccb8 -ac_founders=150 -ac_blocktime=20 -ac_nk=96,5 -earlytxid=810bd62fb8353fad20267ff2050684b8829affa3edf6b366633931530791dfce -addnode=103.6.12.112`
Please test rewards contract works,  and try your own `paymentsrelease` transactions to verify those continue to work. Then make a new chain with better more sane rewards contract and chain parameters.";"";"";

I tried my own test, of making an aiur drop tx, sending it before the next snapshot happens, then mining empty blocks with it stuck in mempool until the next snapshot happens (after sending coins) so the airdroip is now invalid.. 
And it did what I thaught it would, and got stuck in the mempool of the miner, preventing it from mining blocks. I think I found solution though, just remove the tx from mempool when it is rejected by CC_EVAL... as its  difficult to make a payments airdrop TX and this ""attack vector"" (which can happen by accident dure to network latency etc) can only happen once a day, I think this method will work just fine.

Any chance you can check this code for me? for some strange reason the bignum stuff is returning two diffrent values, in RPC and validation. There was a bug that was not doing this rtest properly, and basically allowing any number though. It was only just found. When trying to fix it, I can no longer make payments release txns. 

Flow is in RPC:
1) add all address balances together in RPC to get `mpzTotalAllocations` (this matches validation) 
2) set the allocation for the address in RPC to `mpzValue` 
3) multiply mpzValue with the amount to be released
4) divide this with the `mpzTotalAllocations`  to get the vout nValue. 

Flow in Validation:
1) Check change is in vout 1, and also check txfee amount. 
2) subtract the change and txfee paid from the total tx valueout to get the total amount paid to the actual recipients.  (this matches check prints) 
3)  multiply the balance of the address with the total amount paid (checkamount)
4) Divide this number by the total allocations";"";"üëå (1)";
