I can send you a chain and command to reproduce if you need? May need my jl777 repo though to check it.";"";"";

```
the value of ""destopret"" is used in the opreturn of the transaction that sends the coins to the scriptpubkey 
if the scriptpubkey belongs to a CC that expects a opret in the txn that sends coins to it, then destopret will be used by it

correct me if I am wrong";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"19-Jun-19 01:28 PM";"yes seems correct. 
Basically it was designed for paymentsCC to pay a rewardsCC plan, which requires an op_return attacced to its funding transaction. Other wise funds sent there would be burnt, as the rewards plan wouldnt know what plan the fund were for.";"";"üëç (1)";

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Payments CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!";"";"";
