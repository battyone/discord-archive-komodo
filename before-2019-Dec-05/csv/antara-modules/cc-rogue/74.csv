2) 1 short game with new warrior progress wasn't saved without 0 keystrokes broadcasted with""couldnt find batontxid"" error (but it looks minor in comparison with first two) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=28:28

3) https://pastebin.com/un8FK5k3 - invalid gametxid, or already started  on game start and bailout with warrior gone

-) Warrior had strength.17/16  but he gone in 2 (mentioned in report) 
UPD: it happened in these strange times when I lost warriors - and now I enlarged warrior strength and he started with 17/17 so I wonder it can be not reviewed on this point

-) Warriors created today not saving after re-usage my side (I lost 2 more to ensure and 5 from 5 in total):
