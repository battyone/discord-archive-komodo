I'm one of the many candidates running for election for KMD NN operator in the `EU region`.

I could really use your support and votes.

My proposal `(node-9)` can be found here: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/node-9`

Please send votes to me at this address,  `RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW`

and to other candidates who support the KMD ecosystem, and need votes, at the addresses that they post.

Thanks,
