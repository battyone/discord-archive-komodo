It have not many keystrokes so maybe easy to find out the issue. @ronyi died on lvl1 by hypertermina. 
Extracted keystrokes matching with his local ones: 
```cat rogue.2957615466801226752.0

Last frame in replay ""you're frozen by icemonster""

It don't have Qy in the end. 
Also what is sucpicious ronyi locally have empty ```rogue.2957615466801226752.2``` by some reason (but died on lvl1) - maybe it's the clue.";"";"";
