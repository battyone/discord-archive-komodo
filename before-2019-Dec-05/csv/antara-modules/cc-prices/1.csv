cc/games/prices starts a very simple game, it isnt complete yet, but I thought I would explain what it is about
there is a reference node based on -ac_pubkey which is posting special reference tx with the price of BTC/USD by using the dapp
all other nodes also run the dapp and you can change the betsize with ^ or /, and change the price premium with + or -";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"28-Mar-19 06:40 AM";"every 10 seconds your node will make a bet of betsize with the adjusted BTC/USD price";"";"";

I havent verified it stays in sync yet, so still experimental status. there is even a prices rpc call that returns most recent prices, but the prices logic is still being worked on for the second two prices of each block";"";"";
