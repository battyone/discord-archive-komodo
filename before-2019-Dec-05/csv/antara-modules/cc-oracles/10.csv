I've made a PR of oracles changes. Please make complete test to check if it does not break anything. First test with current timestamp does oracles works as they did up to now. Nothing should change (except oraclesamples that were changed to take baton address instead of txid). Then change PUBKEY_SPOOFING_FIX_ACTIVATION to timestamp before now (for example 1558359845) to see how it will work after July 15th, and check existing oracle with fix activated if nothing breaks (data, subscribe, new registers....)

with `batonutxo`, you can find the latest using `oraclesinfo`, and get x number of datapoints back. You can also use an old `batonutxo` to find samples from a specific batonutxo back.

utxo count output can show what its rate capacity per block is.

I've been to some conferences and presentations, and met quite a few seemingly smart people recently.  They all seem to be waiting for, or recently developed an oracle.
We tested this in Labs over 1 year ago.  Seems quite old.
What am I missing?";"";"";
