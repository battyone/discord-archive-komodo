15 is the max that fits
practically speaking 7 of 13 signers should be sufficient

there are certain things in life that we can't control. we might find ourselves in a situation to change a single key or more in the future.";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"04-Dec-19 10:06 PM";"something like that. it would allow the msig signers to update to a new set of pubkeys, baton makes it mutually exclusive. we can have the convention that the two most recent set of pubkeys are valid. that allows a smooth transition";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"04-Dec-19 10:07 PM";"so the new set of pubkeys is approved by the msig signers. now both addresses are valid, so there shouldnt be a problem with transferring funds from the old to the new address";"";"";
