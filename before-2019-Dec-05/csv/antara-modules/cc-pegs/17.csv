Intro:
- ""To prevent their deposit from being liquidated, the user can either return some of the USDK coins or deposit more tokenized KMD to maintain a good debt ratio.""  -> user must either cover whole debt or deposit more KMD, there is no partial return
- In Pegs Anatar Module Flow, I would add a step where user deposits external crypto into tokens

User tutorial:
- Add the part between KMD deposit and gateway deposit: You must wait for the block where the KMD tx is mined to be submitted to oracle. This can be checkd using oraclessamples call to fetch for exmaple last 5 data entries and check if the height is more or equal to the heigth of the KMD block where the tx is.

Craetor tutorial:
- The synthetic price won't work as it is refering to KMD and the external chain used is KMDTEST. Basically everything must match: external coin name, name in synthetic, token name and oracle name!";"";"üëç (1)";
