```PegCC builds upon on the existing Antara modules Tokens, Gateways, Prices and Oracles.
Tokens are created, and transmitted across chains using Gateways for use within the Pegs chain.
Oracles communicate information about tokens deposited via the Gateway via an ‚Äúoraclefeed‚Äù app, run by the chain owner (and potentially notary nodes).
Oracles also communicate Prices in a trustless manner from a range of external sources, with a 24hr delay.
Via the above, 80% of the value of deposited tokens can be exchanged for a ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù (e.g. USDK) at current Prices market value as reported by the trustless oracle. It is effectively a ‚Äúdeposit and loan‚Äù system, where deposited tokens secure the loan.
The USDK tokens can be traded for fiat / other crypto, or redeemed for the originally deposited crypto used to create them.
If the value of the deposited coin rises, additional USDK is created and available to account holder to withdraw, improving their debt ratio. 
If the value of the deposited coin falls, the worst accounts are subject to liquidation. In this event, a third party can gain a 5% return by paying the debt of the account with an excessive debt ratio (e.g. > 90%). The remainder will be applied to the chain as a whole to improve the global debt ratio to prevent underlying assets of the chain falling below the value of total USDK issued.

"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"08-Aug-19 12:42 PM";"```For example:
Bob uses gatewaysdeposit to convert 100 KMD to KMDT when the market value is $5 per KMD
Bob uses pegsfund to open a new account and then pegsget to convert this KMDT for 375 USDK.
Bob now has 100 KMD (worth $500) securing a ‚Äúloan‚Äù of 375 USDK (worth $375), effectively a 75% debt ratio (375:500). 
Note: This is the opposite of fractional reserve lending!
After some time, KMD rises to $10. Bob‚Äôs debt ratio is now a very healthy 37.5% (375:1000). 
Bob decides to take some profit and exchanges for an additional 375 USDK, rising his debt ratio to 75% (750:1000). 
Bob trades 250 USDK over the counter for $250 USD fiat.
At this stage, Bob‚Äôs original 100 KMDT deposit worth $500 at time of account creation has been converted into 750 USDK. He has sold part of this for $250 in fiat, still has 100KMD (worth $1000) securing his account, and has 500 USDK (worth $500) to trade with - a combined total value of $1750 from his original input of 100KMD ($500 at time of account creation).
```";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"08-Aug-19 12:42 PM";"```After some more time passes, the price of KMD drops back down to $8.25. Bob‚Äôs debt ratio is now at a dangerous level of 90.0909% (750:825), and subject to liquidation.
Alice uses pegsworstaccounts and sees Bob‚Äôs debt ratio has left him vulnerable. She decides to liquidate Bob‚Äôs account using pegsliquidate,  buying out Bob‚Äôs account for 750 USDK. 
At the current market price of $8.25, the 100KMD which was securing Bob‚Äôs account is worth $825. Alice receives a 5% bonus worth 37.5 USDK on top of the 750 USDK cost of liquidating Bob‚Äôs account, which is paid out in the form of 95.4545 KMDT, worth $787.5 at the current KMD price of $8.25.
The remaining 4.5454 KMDT from Bob‚Äôs account is used to maintain the integrity of the pegs chain by reducing the global debt ratio.
Bob still has his remaining 500 USDK (worth $500), and the US$250 fiat he traded for earlier ($750 total). 
The liquidated 100 KMDT account previously securing Bob‚Äôs account (worth $825) is closed, netting Bob a loss of $75 against current $8.25 KMD price at liquidation for failing to maintain a good debt ratio. Fortunately for Bob, he‚Äôs still up $250 against the original $500 input at account creation (100 KMD at $5), and has suffered no net loss.
As Bob no longer has an account, he can use pegsexchange to convert his USDK to KMDT and either cash out with pegsredeem to reclaim 90 KMD, or use pegsfund to open a new account and then pegsget to convert up to 80% of his KMDT to USDK.

KUSD might be seen as a wide range usage token by lot of people.

KMD is a lot less utility coin since its kind of investment and lacks liquidity of main market coins

As a result, market makers can easily take KMD price 10% down in main markets and take profit of the broken contracts...

Unless I missread oracles and the 24h delay and some kind of 24h average makes it harder/not economical to take KMD price down for a lot of time...which would make the above scheme a bit more difficult";"";"";
