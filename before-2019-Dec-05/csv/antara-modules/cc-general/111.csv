"369608312955731968";"Bryan_Beus#6442";"08-Oct-18 01:47 PM";"Ok, that's a bit over my head. I'll save it in my notes and come back to it when I work on channels.

Another question:

Let's say I launch with a pubkey of an address for which I don't have the private key.

A few questions. First, I'm guessing that this means that if I ask or bid for a token and it is accepted, the tokens will be sent to the indicated pubkey -- is that correct?";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:49 PM";"it should generate an error if you try to masquerade for a pubkey you dont have";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:49 PM";"or at best it will transfer things you can sign to an address you cant spend from";"";"";
"369608312955731968";"Bryan_Beus#6442";"08-Oct-18 01:50 PM";"Ok. 

So, to be clear, on an asset chain where I'm not using a pubkey, it's not uncommon to launch with a pubkey that may not be mine. 

For example, this might be a way to donate mining rewards to the developer or something. Is that correct?";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:51 PM";"there is a -donate option for rewards";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:51 PM";"i guess if it works, then yes you can do that";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:52 PM";"not sure how common this would be";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:52 PM";"ALL change goes to the pubkey address";"";"";
"369608312955731968";"Bryan_Beus#6442";"08-Oct-18 01:52 PM";"I just remember reading something about this while reworking docs. I think it was in the zcash default docs.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:52 PM";"it wont be long before all your funds end up  in the pubkey address";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:52 PM";"NOT recommended";"";"";
"369608312955731968";"Bryan_Beus#6442";"08-Oct-18 01:53 PM";"Ooh, okay. I may be misremembering.

So, could we say instead, that under normal circumstances, a user launching with a `-pubkey` parameter active should make sure that they own the privkey to that pubkey?";"";"";
"369608312955731968";"Bryan_Beus#6442";"08-Oct-18 01:53 PM";"That's something I will probably go back and add to the notes...";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"08-Oct-18 01:54 PM";"yes, i probably should just not allow it, but there might be some cases where that is useful";"";"";

Here's what's in the basic api right now:

```
pubkey
------

``pubkey`` sets an address to use as a change address for all transactions. This value must be set to a 33 byte pubkey. All mined coins will also be sent to this address.

Usage:

As a default value in the coin's ``.conf`` file:

::

  pubkey=027dc7b5cfb5efca96674b45e9fda18df069d040b9fd9ff32c35df56005e330392

```";"";"";
"369608312955731968";"Bryan_Beus#6442";"08-Oct-18 01:57 PM";"Ok, added some notes about ensuring they have ownership.";"";"";
"369608312955731968";"Bryan_Beus#6442";"08-Oct-18 02:07 PM";"So, I'm trying to piece together what's happening in the transactions when we use tokens, to see how everything is linked together...

I'm looking at the two txids where I sent 100 of my tokens to a pubkey on another node.
