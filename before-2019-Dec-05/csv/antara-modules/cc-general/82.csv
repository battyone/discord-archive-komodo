"364559422594482176";"Anthony#6143";"27-Aug-18 12:28 PM";"Solidity is built with inheritance, calling on the properties of a parent contract without having to redefine them all.";"";"";
"364559422594482176";"Anthony#6143";"27-Aug-18 12:29 PM";"The question is if with crypto conditions, if it will be built with the ability to inherit properties or functions from other cc contracts";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:31 PM";"please keep in mind that utxo based CC contracts are a totally different animal than solidity. That being said, you can write one CC contract that knows about another CC contract and in essence be invoking it";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:32 PM";"for example there is the assets CC that allows to issue and trade tokens. Another contract could issue tokens and then use the newly issued token as trigger conditions for invoking the payments CC contract.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:32 PM";"I think the way to view it is that each CC contract adds more functionality to a blockchain, which in turn can be used by users directly or by other contracts";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:33 PM";"it is not direct source level inheritance";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:35 PM";"I have explained in detail how the CC contracts work. It is a good idea to not have preconceptions and start with a fresh mind: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/cc/CC%20made%20easy";"";"";
"364559422594482176";"Anthony#6143";"27-Aug-18 12:35 PM";"It is about 1300 lines of code to roll the dice in your example with CC, with solidity you can do it in 200 lines because you can call on the function that was written prior about rolling dice by someone else";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:36 PM";"yes, solidity is a higher level language than the C code I wrote";"";"";
"364559422594482176";"Anthony#6143";"27-Aug-18 12:36 PM";"So I was asking if it is or will be possible to consolidate code and preserve code already written so it can be called on by someone in the future";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:36 PM";"that is not to say a less line count CC contract cant be done by ahigher level language";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:36 PM";"the way for that is to make reusable functions, like in CCutils.cpp, and eventually we should have a library of functions to do standard things";"";"";
"364559422594482176";"Anthony#6143";"27-Aug-18 12:37 PM";"So what I see is that crypto conditions is in addition to blockchain consensus";"";"";
"364559422594482176";"Anthony#6143";"27-Aug-18 12:37 PM";"the code is programmed into the blockchain etc";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"27-Aug-18 12:37 PM";"plz keep in mind these are the initial 4 CC contracts, very early in the lifecycle and rather than try to reduce the lines of code, I made each one have no dependencies on any other, that way the entirety of what is needed is seen";"";"";
