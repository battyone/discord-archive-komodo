all of the above are the standard bitcoin vout types and there should be plenty of materials about it

what I did with the CC contracts is created a fourth type of vout, the CC vout. this is using the cryptoconditions standard and it is even a different signature mechanism. ed25519 instead of secp256k1. it is basically a big extension to the bitcoin script.

this is just an arbitrary number. but what it does is allows to create a self-contained universe of CC utxo that all have the same evalcode and that is how a faucet CC differentiates itself from a dice CC, the eval code is different

one effect from using a different eval code is that even if the rest of the CC script is the same, the bitcoin address that is calculated is different. what this means is that for each pubkey, there is a unique address for each different eval code!
and this allows efficient segregation of one CC contracts transactions from another";"";"";

I put both the privkey and pubkey for a randomly chosen address and associate it with each CC contract. That means anybody can sign outputs for that privkey. However, it is a CC output, so in addition to the signature, whatever constraints a CC contract implements must also be satistifed. This allows funds to be locked and yet anybody is able to spend it, assuming they satisfy the CC's rules

one other technical note is that komodod has the insight-explorer extensions built in. so it can lookup directly all transactions to any address. this is a key performance boosting thing as if it wasnt there, trying to get all the utxo for an address not in the wallet is quite time consuming";"";"💯 (1),👍 (2),👏 (2),🇨 (1),© (1),Komodo (5)";
