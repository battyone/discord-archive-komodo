I am reading through the BarterDex api docs (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/barterDEX-API-Summary-by-Category#buy) and under the ""buy"" method it says that ""If a match is not found, a bid order will be added in the orderbook"". However, when I issue a buy order that doesn't have a match, nothing is added to the orderbook. I can see the buy order being broadcast to the network, and then it times out with a ""time expired for Alice_request"". Whereas if I run ""setprice"" instead, I can immediately see the ask/bid in the orderbook. Is this misdocumented, or am I missing something? maybe I need to add some parameter to the buy order to get it added to the orderbook and stay there for a certain duration?";"";"";

Afaik, if you buy and nothing happens, the Alice request expires. The GTC flag will cause BarterDex to repeatedly try and ‚Äúbuy‚Äù periodically until you stop it. To set a price, I believe you‚Äôre making a Bob configuration where your request is broadcast to the orderbooks then passively awaits Alice requests.";"";"";
