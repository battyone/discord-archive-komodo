"457121878465708043";"artem.pikulin#0794";"24-Sep-19 01:12 PM";"@jorian Hi, please notice that `price` field is not just `11`, it's a number with many zeros after decimal point. So in rational representation it actually becomes `11000000.... / 1000......` which are huge numbers and do not fit standard integer types. So as mentioned in docs these numbers are represented as array of smaller fixed size integers (uint32) and ordered in little endian. It's actually a common way of big numbers implementation.
As it's impossible to copy-paste from screenshot let me provide a smaller number example:
1. Decimal number representation is `11.00000000000000000000000000000000000000`
2. Rational in fraction form: `1100000000000000000000000000000000000000/100000000000000000000000000000000000000`
3. JSON form `[[1,[0,1760524480,3821695294,999050043,3]],[1,[0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448]]]`
So in JSON implementation we have 2 numbers `[0,1760524480,3821695294,999050043,3]` which is 160 bit integer `1100000000000000000000000000000000000000` and `[0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448]` which is 128 bit integer `100000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

Such arrays can be parsed as (pseudo code):
```
nums = [0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448];
sum = 0;
for i in 0..array.len() {
    sum += nums[i] * 2.pow(32 * i);
}
```
So let's take a look at [0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448]. According to snippet it's 0 * 2^0 + 160047680 * 2^32 + 1518781562 * 2^64 + 1262177448 * 2^96, which is exactly `100000000000000000000000000000000000000`.


But the problem is this huge number can be effectively reduced to just `[[1,[11]],[1,[1]]]`, which wasn't done by MM2, so it's now fixed: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/commit/87fc4beb3e78f5f75cf235d930ebaa5dc3427327.

And the other problem is: where does `11.0000...` come from? I guess it's intended to be just `11`. Did you create the order by yourself or it's received from other node?";"";"";
"457121878465708043";"artem.pikulin#0794";"24-Sep-19 01:31 PM";"`and why this is a good thing?` this particular example wasn't good thing of course, but it should be fixed now by reducing the fraction. The good thing is:
1. Let's say you have 1 MORTY.
2. You want to buy RICK at 11 MORTY per 1 RICK rate.
3. So your desired amount of RICK is 1/11.
4. 1/11 can't be represented as finite decimal, it's `0.09090909....`.
So if we don't use rational here, how should we handle this case to sell exactly 1 MORTY? Of course we can cut it to just `0.09090909`, but then it leaves 1 annoying satoshi as `0.09090909 * 11 = 0.99999999`. Ok, let's try to slightly increase the price to let's say `11.000002`. But then it becomes that `0.09090909 * 11 = 1.00000017181818` which is larger than required 1 by 17 satoshis (that we might not have by the way).";"";"";
"457121878465708043";"artem.pikulin#0794";"24-Sep-19 01:32 PM";"And also as MM2 is multi-coin tool such calculations might become even more tricky since ETH is using uint256 type internally and 18 decimals.";"";"";
"457121878465708043";"artem.pikulin#0794";"24-Sep-19 01:33 PM";"So it's actually the easiest way to let it be `1/11` and then this value is just truncated to required decimals precision of specific coin: for 8 decimals it will be `0.09090909`, for 18 decimals `0.090909090909090909` and so on.";"";"";
