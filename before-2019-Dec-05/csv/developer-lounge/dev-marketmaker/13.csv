It's still unsafe to trade assets with real market cost. Also we don't have the GUI for it yet so it's too early to announce `public` tests for the globe. We need to be sure that MM2 works correctly in different environments. Every computer/server is actually unique: OS version, installed updates and applications, different internet providers, etc. 
So we invite you to participate in `private` community testing! The only requirement is you are familiar with CLI and ready to provide detailed report if you find an issue. If you have only old Windows 7 laptop it's fine, we need to cover as more `real user` environments as possible. Your contribution will help to make MM2 `much` better and drive it to release faster. If you can't wait to start playing with MM2 please DM me, I will add you to special `MM2 community tester` group and instruct what to do next. Thanks in advance to everyone, we're doing our best for you!";"";"";

```
artem.pikulin12/26/2018
@crypto999 Hi, swap protocol design discussions took place at 2015-2016: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1340621.msg13828271#msg13828271, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951 when there were just few coins with BIP65 (CLTV) support. The purpose was to allow one side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig output so at least  Alice can swap the coin without CLTV.
Nowadays most coins have CLTV opcode support so swap protocol will be simplified in MM2, both payments will be hash/time locked outputs, Bob won't need 212% balance to trade anymore.
``` 

I understand about CLTV, but in an attack scenario I don't understand how this mitigates a Bob from ""faking it"" and accepting a bunch of trades but never filling them. In that scenario, wouldn't there be a bunch of Alice's doing ""alicepayments"" and locking their funds up when a malicious bob has no intention of actually sending his ""bobpayment"" (filling the order). This seems like it could cause a lot of trouble on the DEX, especially if a fake bob set a really low exchange rate which beat out other real bob's.";"";"";

Actually `old` protocol had same issues, it didn't prevent order spamming from someone not planning to follow protocol at all. We should separate `atomic swap protocol` from such `security` discussions. From `security` point of view protocol must guarantee that if it's not followed properly both sides won't lose their funds and that's it. Detecting a malicious trader and banning him is responsibilty of other MM2 modules that `interact` with `atomic swap`. Think of it this way: if you implement server on top of `HTTP` protocol, the protocol itself doesn't protect you automagically from `HTTP flood`, it's responsibility of your application to detect and ban someone trying to send malicious requests (DDos or other attacks).";"";"";
