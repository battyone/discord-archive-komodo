as for the calls, it's a `submitblock` that returns like `checkdeposit: ht.393534 checktoshis 0.00980000 overflow.0 total 0.01000000 strangeout.0` in stdout (obviously a fees issue in the block) and after that `getblocktemplate` fails (as does at least one of the payment calls, but I'm not sure exactly which one).
I haven't tried anything else yet because it requires such a specific fail to begin with that I can't catch inside that 60-90 second window very often.
I working on an unrelated pool that doesn't have that issue, so when I get that one done I might try creating intentionally bad blocks to see if I can force it to try other calls manually.";"";"";
