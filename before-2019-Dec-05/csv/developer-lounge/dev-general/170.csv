Max SanchezYesterday at 7:09 PM
Thanks to everyone for their patience, as Tim mentioned we have deployed a fix for the network issue we experienced. 

If your node is stuck on a block around height 87634 then please upgrade to the following version:
https://mirror1.veriblock.org/veriblock-nodecore-all-0.4.4-rc.4.tar

You can copy your entire mainnet folder, nodecore.properties, etc. from your current nodecore version to 0.4.4-rc.4, no need to re-sync. We are going to release a new bootstrap file soon as well, for anyone who wants to use it.


There was a very abnormal block reorganization that included a block with an invalid transaction. The invalid block was (to most nodes on the network) originally received on an alternate fork (not main-chain) but a miner built another block on top of that invalid alternate block which caused the network to attempt to switch over to this ""now better"" chain with the invalid block in it. While applying the new chain the network correctly identified the block as invalid and started reverting back to the correct chain, however the unapplication left the cache of block headers in a bad state due to the order in which ledger modifications were being reversed, so pools were unable to calculate difficulty for the next template (or properly invalidate PoP transactions in their block templates which referenced blocks in the invalid fork). 0.4.4-rc.4 fixes the root cause of the issue, so reorganizations to invalid chains will always properly self-heal.

ratholesYesterday at 8:50 PM
question though, how come there is a re-org if the blockchain is protected by bitcoin nethash?  re-org leads to double spend. I thought what is promoted by VBK is security yet it is susceptible.
Max SanchezYesterday at 9:48 PM
@ratholes It was a 3-block reorg within a single keystone period. VeriBlock's PoP prevents against long-range reorg, but short reorgs will occur with any PoW blockchain due to network latency, etc. For the simplest example, if two miners both produce a block at a particular height at the ""same"" time, only one of those blocks will become part of the main chain, and the other will be orphaned. 

VeriBlock PoP ensures that the security level of transactions in a particular block are public knowledge and are available in real-time. In the absence of publications of competing VBK blocks at a certain height for the BTC finality period means that VeriBlock cannot be reorganized at/beyond that point without also requiring a reorg of Bitcoin itself.
