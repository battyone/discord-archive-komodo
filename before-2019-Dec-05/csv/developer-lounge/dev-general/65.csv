I'm trying to deploy to GitHub pages. It should be fairly standard stuff, and has always worked until I recently started collaborating with others in the same repository. Once I pulled in changes from a dev branch that had a few commits from another user, deploying to GitHub Pages stopped working.

I'm assuming that there's some environment variable somewhere that's giving git troubles, but I'm not sure where.

Here is the deploy.sh file that I run, and which is supposed to automate the entire GitHub pages creation process.

And here is a Gist with the terminal output when I run it.
