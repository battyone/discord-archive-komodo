During the period between the last notarization and the present moment, that's where your consensus mechanism is still in play.

If you're worried about someone maliciously attacking your blockchain during the ten/twenty minutes since the last notarization, you just need to decide what style of chain you want.

You can make a KMD-based chain have any percentage you choose of PoW vs PoS.

One of the chains in our system, Verus, uses a hybrid between PoS and PoW, for this reason. I think they even wrote some of the underyling code for it, but I'm not sure.";"";"";

On the other hand, having at least some of the PoW method available in your consensus mechanism will allow you to ensure that anyone can mine a block. This curtails censorship, and other issues.

If you're not worried about a time delay, best to keep your chain primarily PoW.";"";"";

So, with some trial and error I find that I only need to submit the height for `minerids`.

I'm assuming the `needs` thing was put there by accident?

Also, in the response I receive, I see that inside the `miners` array there are 64 objects for notary nodes, and then one additional object that has 
```
{
        ""pubkey"": ""external miners"",
        ""blocks"": 541
}
```
Can you tell me about this object?

Also, in the notary node objects, I see that there's a `blocks` property as well. I believe these properties are related? Can you tell me about this as well?

When you're on an asset chain, the other person just needs to also be running the same new coin daemon (which you just created) on their computer.

Since you don't have a GUI software wallet for it, yet (though you may be able to integrate with our Agama wallet), the other person just needs to enter this into their command prompt (I'm typing for Linux, if you need MacOS or Win, lmk)

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIKAFFYCOIN getnewaddress
```
That will create a new address for them.

They tell you what address they have, and then you send them money from your machine by going like this
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIKAFFYCOIN sendtoaddress ""YOURFRIENDSADDRESS"" amount_number

That's it, for the command prompt.
