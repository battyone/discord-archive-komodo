bind
----

``bind`` is a runtime parameter that instructs the coin daemon to bind to a given address and always listen on it.

Use ``[host]:port`` notation for IPv6.

Usage:

For exapmle, to connect to 127.0.0.1:9050 for one-time usage:

::

  komodod -bind=127.0.0.1:9050

To set as a default parameter, include `bind=<address>` in your `COIN.conf` file.

::

  bind=127.0.0.1:9050

I hear some people say that when you enter a komodo-cli command for an asset chain, you should enter both `-ac_name=NAME` and `-ac_supply=SUPPLY` with each command.

Then I also observe that most people don't do this. Instead, they just do `-ac_name=NAME` and leave off the supply.

What should I indicate for best practices, in the documentation?

Whenever I call `getchaintips`, the chain crashes. Doesn't matter which chain. I've tried asset chains, Komodo, and a regtest chain.

Here's the gdb backtrace from right before the crash:
