But there is no reason to become insulting and rude. Posts like `[...] as much of a dick as this guy [...]` are insults and will/can not be tolerated. **Take this as a final warning!**

IF you do think you have a good idea that justifies a Komodo Improvement Proposal then please do open a ticket on https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo/issues - if you have such basic questions plz contact support next time which could have resolved your problem faster by answering directly or referring you to the right person.";"";"";

step 2 - ask a question in the appropriate channel, and be patient. search discord, read more, and you might figure out who is working on what you are interested in.
step 3 - avoid insulting devs, you might need their insight later - and it wont make other devs inclined to interact.";"";"";
