I understand that every ten minutes, the komodo blockchain is written on the bitcoin blockchain by the notary nodes so if you want to make a 51% attack, you need to overpower bitcoin. So here are my questions.
1. How (I mean technically) are the komodo blockchain written in the bitcoin blockchain?
2. How the bitcoin is queried by the komodo nodes to verify their chains? Must they run a bitcoin node alongside the komodo one?
3. How the proof in the bitcoin blockchain is known by the komodo nodes?
