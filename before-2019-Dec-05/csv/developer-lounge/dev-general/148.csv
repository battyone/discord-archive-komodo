Which means that a centralized entity has to be trusted to determine what outcomes are/aren't valid
Back to the grass example:
The outcome is ""grass is blue"", consensus decides that to be a ""lie""
The centralized entity must be trusted to provide a ""grass is green"" option to fork to
If the centralized entity only provides ""grass is red"" and the existing ""grass is blue"", then the network will fork to ""grass is red"" and still not hold ""truth""";"";"";
