I sent a bit of cash from z address A to z address B.

Both z address A and B were in this wallet.dat file.

Before I backed up and erased the wallet.dat file, I made sure that the money was received in z address B, and it was there.

Then, I imported the private key for B into another computer, and the funds were not there.

Tried deleting all the blockchain data, and redownloading and reindexing. 

Still no luck. Address B is empty. I have to wonder if I was mistaken in what I saw for address B.

It's not a large about of money, but I at least want to be careful not to repeat the same mistake.";"";"";
