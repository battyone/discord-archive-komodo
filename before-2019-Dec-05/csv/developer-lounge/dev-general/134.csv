- There are many features in the Komodo Ecosystem that can make an asset chain's daemon produce non-standard coinbase transactions. Examples include an assetchain parameter that creates new coins for a specified pubkey in every block or a CC module that adds outputs to the coinbase transaction.
- This can be dealt using a mode called `disablecb`
  - Usage: `./komodo-cli getblocktemplate '{""mode"":""disablecb""}'`
- The block template produced using this mode doesn't have the `""coinbasetxn"": { ... } json object` but adds the coinbase transction to the `""transactions"":[ ... ] array` just like a regular transaction.
- Now the pool software can use the `""transactions"":[ ... ] array` to create a block and take fees in the payment processor.
```

Long ago, slush came up with a ""middle man"" theory for a pool to get the relevant data from the daemon and have the pool decide what work to dole out to workers.
With ""stratum"" (in theory, at least), not every worker is working with the exact same random variable.
This gives the pool both greater control and, in theory, a greater chance of finding a block.
Core developers loved slush and this new theory so much that the code for giving a miner work directly was entirely stripped out of the code and the ""stratum"" method became the new way of doing things";"";"";
