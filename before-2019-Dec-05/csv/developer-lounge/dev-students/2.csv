The (beta) 5 minute quickstart may be available next week with some light docs - so unfortunately, my own way of getting you going quickly is:


1.  `docker pull imylomylo/jl777-komodo/dev` will get an image from https://hub.docker.com/r/imylomylo/jl777-komodo-dev/ (github link there for Dockerfile)

Works best on ubuntu.

There is no CORS support on the daemon atm, so you need to proxy the RPC requests.   There are nodejs modules to help with this, but i haven't explored them because I'm working on a nodejs rpc lib https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib/tree/master/src


Otherwise, use a virtual machine with ubuntu - you can then use docker in there or work on building komodo from source http://i.mylomylo.com/build-komodo-source
