It burns on the first chain, and then the other chain uses MoMoM tech to prove that the burn happened, and allows coins to be ""created"" on that chain. So a bunch of chains act as a single chain. So far we have run into quite  a few issues, but we have done a few hundred transfers in testing before trying to launch our actual cluster. I dont think its an issue with the MoMoM stuff as such, just how we implemented it.";"";"üëå (5),üí™ (5)";

recent tweaks seem to have slightly lowered the average over 1min/5min spans - yet to confirm if this is valid, but I think it is and better to underestimate than overestimate.
Vis does not have all test data. Some earlier tests with more than 64 chains I didn't have access to block source to validate afterwards, and those timespans were purged - they would have higher values. With 64 chains, as the validated sections on vis are, we'd expect about 9500tx/s and 60,000payments/sec on average, with some variation depending on how fast blocks were being solved.
We did a test with 256 cahins which is not on vis. That test pulled about 45k tx/s at peak";"";"";

If community testing is possible, I‚Äôd like to use some of the experts to do other scaling tests like smart contract, consensus extending scalability and look into cross chain scaling factors.

yes.   for our stuff.  we have the funding already from AWS marketing to use for this test.
we'll start with 64 chains optimized, then ramp them up each test leading up to it, 64 > 128 > 512 > 1024 and more if we can and have budget left.
