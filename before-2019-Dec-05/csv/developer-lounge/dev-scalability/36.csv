I can see creating chains based on geography, regions, cities, towns, where there is a lot of cache effects. Also to create currencies by type of usage, ie. around product types.";"";"";

This is similar to converting your fiat into different fiat when you travel.";"";"";

I highly doubt you can design an allocation of chains ahead of time (as nobody can predict things as complex as economies), so just spawn more chains if there are not enough in certain areas";"";"";

The team are pushing towards going live in early July and it will not be using any scaling features other than on the main chain to start with - and i agree with that - you need to walk before you can run. Unfortunately, because i am not part of the team, i don't have access to ongoing development plans until they roll out the development plan for community involvement so i don't know what/if scalability features they plan.

I am just looking for my own inerest at the moment although it might be possible that i have more influence as the community gets involved. The main chain is involved in some on the Instant Swap tech so it might become an issue in the future but am sure that it is ""fast enough"" for the launch - i just think there should be plans for scalability and it is difficult to hard partition as Komodo are planning";"";"";

I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.";"";"";

For some reason, the tactile feedback on entering my pin could be more sensitive.  For the 6 number password, it often only registers 5 numbers. Not sure why, but it happens more often than not.  Also, when a atomic swap fails, it would be better to have the error message stay up until you confirm OK.  Many times I am trying to read the error message but it dissapears before I finish reading it.  Overall, the mobile DEX is impressive and I am excited for Komodo's future.  Keep up the great work. üëå";"";"";
