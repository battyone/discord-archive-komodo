We figured out from the first test, that capturing it in real time was going to be very hard, and devised a system to do it, it wasn't easy, but this appears to be the best way to measure whats happening as is happens. You can use the script that Dwy made to get about 1024 chains at once, and then merge the SQL DB's together etc, but it becomes quite tedious and difficult. specifically since we are running everything in containers now. However the blockchain data and the JSON generated on each block, containing its timestamp, size and number of transactions, are all saved in the cloud for anyone to check.

Our most important priority this week, will be to make sure the live data is 99% accurate and documenting how it works etc. I think being transparent about how we did it, and showing the results should be enough for most people. I understand  that people will be sceptical with such a vast number of TX/s, and the estimated size of the blockchains for the test is 6.4TB! üòÆ";"";"";
