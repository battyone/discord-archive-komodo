According to these, if each EC2 instance, is a cluster of 64 chains, we are well inside all limits.

We were working with @blackjok3r  during weekend on AWS Kubernetes cluster. I managed to create POD which contains 2 containers - assetchain container and miner container. This test suppose to give us working K8N definition yaml file, which we can now templatize in order to create X chains. @blackjok3r  was trying to setup EFS provisioner which allows us to mount EFS storage as a persistent volume into Kubernetes cluster. The idea is that every POD/container will have EFS volume attached and blockchain data will be stored there. These data can be used as a proof after the scaling test is finished. We had some troubles with EFS, it could not create PV/PVC. @blackjok3r  I managed to fix it, it was issue with RBAC which was needed to be setup for our cluster. I can now mount EFS volume to both containers and write data there. Next step is to create more PODs (3?) to test they are writing its blockchain to correct place. In the meantime I am going to create script for  generating Kubernetes definition yaml files for all chains participating in scaling test.";"";"üëç (5),Komodo (3)";

128 x m4.x16large : $409.60 per hour
Test goes for approx 2H, but it is unknown how long it takes to start all containers at this stage.
I think its safe to bank on a 6-8H peroid, but it will hopefully be much less than this.
We will have a better idea once we run the 256 chain test on EKS.
Maximum: $3280

DynamoDB:
150 Writes / 1500 Reads: Approx $23 per 24/h 

Lambda + API's: For our application this is free or under $1 for entire test and all testing so far.

EKS: 20c per hour for cluster, all chains should run in a single cluster, unless we need to split over 2 regions.
Most of the cost here will be running this cluster in the weeks leading up to the test, although once it is working we can destroy it and redeploy at a later date to save money.
2 regions for an entire week is: $135

EFS: $102 per day with 10TB of data. It would be silly to leave the data on here long term, we would move it to a dedicated HDD server to save vast sums of money, after the test is run.
I guess bank on $400 here as a total maximum, depending on how long it takes to transfer 7-10TB of data to a permenant server, and also data bandwidth could be a factor to move out of AWS if we do that.
-----------------------------
Maximum worst case cost of AWS: $3839 ‚Äì I think there is still $2000 credit on the account, but we will use up some of this in the final tests and the 256 chain test.";"";"";

We need 4 servers for notarization, I would prefer to host them outside of AWS as proof the chains work over long distances and the internet in general, not just in a closed AWS environment. 
Maybe some cheap hetzner servers, or something we already have access too. I ran this on four 4 Core 16GB VPS's on my first try months ago, but they were a little small. 
Four of 6 core 32Gb will be the minimum requred here, either VPS or dedicated server from any provider with good network speed.
I would also like these up at least 2 days in advance and possibly a server with explorers for the first 64 chains only so people can inspect the notarization TX's.

We have 2MB blocks, each can fit 8859 TX of single payment inside, and we have 60s block time.
Each assetchain can do just under 150 TX/s
But if you batch the TX's and do more payments per TX, you can get much bigger numbers.
If every TX is 100 payments for example the calcuation is:
`557 * 100 /60 = 928` Payments per second.";"";"";
