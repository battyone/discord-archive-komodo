https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/71729215/What+is+the+5+Komodo+Stake+Reward

```
The 5% reward starts accumulating after a few minutes if you hold over 10 KMD in your wallet.
```

It will more likely be around an hour not a few minutes if nLockTime is set slightly in the past.

```
It is very similar to POS 
```
And then in the next line:
```
KMD's POS is a hybrid zero footprint proof of stake
```

These two statements seem to contradict each other, saying it's **similar** to PoS and then saying it **is** PoS then saying it's **hybrid** PoS.

Also, it's completely unrelated to PoS, it's not a consensus mechanism. I think the comparison to PoS is confusing, PoS should either not be mentioned at all, or only be mentioned purely to explain that Komodo is not PoS and KMD rewards are nothing to do with stake rewards.";"";"";
