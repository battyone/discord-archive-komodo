@phideas despites of this message, the tx actually gets broadcasted. i already notified ledger team about this.
this happens if you only use Ledger Live for sending tx. if you send tx from Ledger, still it doesn't set locktime. thus, no rewards accruing possible
phideasYesterday at 20:15
Yes, i noticed too. Any chance Ledger Live plans to set Locktime for KMD tx?

and Ledger themselves

```
While Ledger hardware wallets have supported storing Komodo for quite some time, previously it was not possible to claim the 5% Active User Reward, as it did not set a transaction LockTime which is used to calculate the rewards.
```
nLockTime is required on transactions for the outputs to accrue interest, however this wasn't the issue on the Ledger, transactions sent to the Ledger from elsewhere with nLockTime set would still accrue interest.

The issue was that actual KMD app running on the Ledger could not sign reward claim transactions because the outputs are larger than the inputs. This breaks BTC consensus rules the Ledger device would throw an error and refuse to sign.

This needed to be fixed in the KMD Ledger app (that runs on the device, not Ledger Live) before any software could get the Ledger to sign a reward claim transaction";"";"üëç (2)";

However, it doen't set nLockTime. So now your 95 KMD balance is sitting in a change UTXO from a transaction with no nLockTime set so will no longer accrue rewards.
