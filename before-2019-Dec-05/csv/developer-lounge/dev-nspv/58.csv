Now I have another question, for example I am in a video game, I have the sufficient number of gold to buy an item, I buy this item, visually I see immediately that my golds have been debited from my wallet. In the case of the blockchain we have to wait for the confirmation to be sure of the transaction, the feeling of play will not be skewed by the fact of seeing its sum debited later and receive his item only once the confirmed transaction?

(everything using nspv)";"";"";
