"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 09:53 AM";"Ideally here are the steps I'm trying to follow:

The user starts his game with his own blockchain (create with the antara composer for example) He has setup his coin file and is now ready to spawn a new instance of nSPV directly from his game on his new blockchain. Once it's done, nSPV connects to the node of its blockchain, so far no problem. The idea is that the first time I start the game I will use the call rpc getnewaddress to create the portfolio of the player if I followed well. But the next time I log in I want to use my wallet with the address I just created. (so i use the login rpc call with the `wif` or the `seed` and there i'm ready to do anything i need";"";"";

"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 09:55 AM";"I guess it's exactly what is done in the AtomicDex";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"13-Nov-19 09:55 AM";"and the user could also copy down the seed";"";"";

"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 09:56 AM";"I will follow the same approach so.";"";"";

"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 09:57 AM";"I guess that i have one seed / coin too";"";"";
"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 09:57 AM";"So i should probably ask only one pin for every seed";"";"";

"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 09:59 AM";"So i create one the first time, and if the seed exist, use login instead of getnewaddress";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"13-Nov-19 10:00 AM";"makes sense. keep in mind the login lasts 777 seconds, after that the privkey is erased from memory";"";"";
"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 10:01 AM";"Means after login i should use the rpc calls for getting history stuff, etc and save it";"";"";

"206445134122844170";"Slyris#2880";"13-Nov-19 10:02 AM";"I can i think run a dedicated thread for that, that login every 777 seconds and refresh information that the user need's.";"";"";

I'm in a rpg video games, and i have golds (which is my coins) let's say i have 2000 RICK in game

I want to spend 1000, i will use `spent + broadcast` so i need to be `logged` here there is 2 solutions:

- Ask the pin at the moment where the user whant to buy something in game
- After the user logged in the game and enter his pin (once)  i automatically call `login` rpc call for him every 777 seconds for the session and don't ask pin anymore in game.

What we will prefer here ? Should we let the choice to the user to configure this behavior ?";"";"";
