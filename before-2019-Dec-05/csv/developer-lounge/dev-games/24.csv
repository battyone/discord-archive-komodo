@Strob and I were discussing this in February.  
It just took the right person to find to make it happen, and I think @Meyse finding and bringing in @TwilightPunkster K64 at that meetup one day was the critical catalyst.  

He is the proverbial Rats tail to Komodo as it was to Final Fantasy I.

Bunch of games made by only self-funded indies that aren't even close to live playable or tested massively yet, with 100% vendor lock. And you still need Ethereum to transfer your ENJ from your wallet, so you still need to keep that secure. Also, they partnered AND locked themselves with Unity. Which is great, BUT... Unity isn't the only game engine around. Let's be honest, I love Unity, but its only secondary in performance compared to Unreal. That's just the bare fucking truth. Now, let's not mention all other engines, or even custom 3D engines. Oh, well. Enjin had the financial backing of kadzillion dollars and took two years to create a wallet. A wallet. Yes. I think we can expect maybe a gem, maybe five gems in the giant mountain of turds.";"";"";

"283395529449406464";"TwilightPunkster K64#7533";"21-Mar-19 07:22 PM";"Actually, I want to apply for a lot of grants (a lot of the exist). However, they come with a lot of paperwork. At this moment, @Meyse and I are focusing on Komodore64 which will be the beginning, which now is mostly done in Unity. I really would like to develop with Unreal too, and definitely will work out the SDK port towards it; as the grant applies to that. However, that would require me to get at least two experienced developers in Unreal Engine that spend their time for a month to create a concept that can apply for a 100-250K grant , who have to sit somewhere, consume beans and pizza, work with high end machines. So, unless if someone is batshit crazy enough to drop 30Ks, I'll think I just focus on the tasks at hand 😉 There are plenty game ideas, but developers that can keep up with our insane velocity, workflow and open communication is a hard task. Also, don't underestimate that a good demo takes real time and effort; of course a smaller project will apply, but my aim is never to go for second place, but passing the test first time.";"";"";
