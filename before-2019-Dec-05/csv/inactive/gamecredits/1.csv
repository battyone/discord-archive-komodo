Long story short: we are creating a GameCredits Foundation to break away from GNation, who is neglecting blockchain development. And we’re looking for people to join and help us out, mostly as volunteers to begin with the possibility of pay in the future. If you’re interested, I will share your name with Nele from GameCredits - the guy who is pushing to get one set up. Even if we can just get a few official Komodo folks backing (no money necessary) we have a chance to show GNation that crypto is with us and we can secure funding from them.

We are still not 100% sure the exact impact, but with 2 notarizations it appears to be not an issue at all and since the exchanges are using N confirms such that it is getting more than 1 notarization, the risk appears to be small.

we have an early fix that has tested out to resist this attack scenario, but it is not clear yet if it will be a hardforking change or not as things are in the unexpected territory. Also, there might be secondary issues that we will also find and fix after we test the patch more.

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"12-Oct-18 02:58 PM";"not on KMD itself, want to make sure it is validated fully first";"";"";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"12-Oct-18 02:59 PM";"Ahh, ok. So then on some asset chain that is active...";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"12-Oct-18 02:59 PM";"next hardrfork to update notaries is when I expect it to go active";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"12-Oct-18 02:59 PM";"yes, much safer to put such cutting edge tech on the smaller chains";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"12-Oct-18 03:00 PM";"i mean we think it is solid, but only way to know something is ready for field deployment is a smaller field deployment";"";"👍 (1)";

1) a gateway where users can swap game for game(kmd) and back, allowing users to use crypto conditions";"";"";
"131987896084332544";"n64#7103";"16-Oct-18 06:37 PM";"2) a possible airdrop for existing game holders";"";"";
"131987896084332544";"n64#7103";"16-Oct-18 06:38 PM";"option 1 is still preferred, but possibly with some “bonuses” if those users held game at a certain block height";"";"";
"131987896084332544";"n64#7103";"16-Oct-18 06:38 PM";"the reason 1 is preferred is because exchanges will likely not add GAMEkmd for a while to come, especially since we have no funding at all";"";"";
"131987896084332544";"n64#7103";"16-Oct-18 06:39 PM";"does an assetchain have to be mined or can it act like an erc20 token does: eg where there’s no mining and blocks depend on the parent chain?";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"16-Oct-18 06:44 PM";"you will be able to have a CPU minable coin";"";"";
"131987896084332544";"n64#7103";"16-Oct-18 07:11 PM";"I think it would be great to test this out. Iirc 1 kmd can get me up to 100 mil of an assetchain issued... the tough part is a gateway to swap back and forth";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"16-Oct-18 07:15 PM";"we are testing gateways CC now that automatically (mostly) binds an external coin to a token";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"16-Oct-18 07:15 PM";"once that works, we will extend it to use the native coin instead of a token";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"16-Oct-18 07:15 PM";"then we get a 1:1 two way pegged chain";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"16-Oct-18 07:16 PM";"this chain shouldnt be mining any significant number of new coins as they would be able to be converted to the external coin (GAME)";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"16-Oct-18 07:16 PM";"but if a little dilution is ok, then some small per block reward like 0.0001 would at least motivate CPU mining";"";"";
