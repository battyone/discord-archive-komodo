This means that simply switching mm to cmc v2 API will not be enough, everybody that wants to use the API will have to register, get an API key and use it to fetch the price updates.
I think this is not very practical and the problem is that the free API only offers 6k calls/month, or 200/day... this is not much, especially when you have more then one node.
The best solution would be to get a ""Enterprise"" key and configure it directly in mm, but someone would have to negotiate with CMC. This are the ""normal"" pricing for CMC API: https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/pricing
What do you think? Is this a way, or should we think about other ways?";"";"";
