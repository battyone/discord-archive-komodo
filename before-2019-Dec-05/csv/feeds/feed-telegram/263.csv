Im not talking about pay-per-click or personal spend. I was talking more about partnerships and working with media outlets to get things published on their channels. For instance, getting community champions to write competitive articles or paying someone in KMD could post an article highlighting differences between say Monero and KMD..Doing comparison articles expands the SEO beyond your scope because it captures both parties and you relay on the news outlets user base to spread the word";"";"";

If you feel like paying for advertising, feel free to raise funds and pay to promote some of these articles, but as it's been stated, it's a negative ROI.
Better would be to share them in relevant circles to the content. For example sharing Game centered articles in game dev channels, or supply chain stuff on LinkedIn with supply companies, etc. Word of mouth also is huge.
