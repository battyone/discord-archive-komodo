Today is the day. 20 hours left and we will mass buy a coin. The team is totally ready. The strategy will be the same as last pump. Our team had contact with various news channels. Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin.

The helpers got hundreds of DM's about if this is going to be a rank pump or not. Like we stated in the Discord. The rank system is close to being ready. This means, that this pump it will still be free-for-all. Like last time everyone will receive the coin signal at the same time!";"";"";
