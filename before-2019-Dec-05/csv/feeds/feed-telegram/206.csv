In order to be able to get the article published, your team would only have to get in contact with our CEO and ask for the opportunity. Komodo deserves more and more exposure!! Once you write the article and we publish it, GCN will promote it, and of course it would be an honor for me to promote the article on my personal social media, specially in Twitter. I have some 1700 followers of our news. About 1k are Japanese (since I'm half Japanese, though I live in Costa Rica). It would be great if Komodo Team decided to publish now that we can get a free publication. I promise to try to help and to support as much as I can! For more information, I can DM of course!)";"";"";
