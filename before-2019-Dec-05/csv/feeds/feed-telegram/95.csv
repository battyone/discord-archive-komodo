"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"09-Aug-18 06:24 PM";"[telegram] <q16858857> Dear admin:
From the first issue of bitcoin in 2009 to less than 10 years ago, a huge market with over 100 billion US dollars has been formed. No matter in real estate, stock market, fund or futures market, no profit can catch up with the speed of the rising of digital money. It even exceeds the threshold of your fantasy, which contains amazing wealth potential.
Now that you have been involved in digital currency, there is a desire to replace BitCoin, and now, at the edge of the exchange, do you feel the body and soul trembling at the edge of the exchange when you are the nearest to the realization of this ideal?
Now, just the last step, as long as the vote is passed, the gate of CoinEx will be open for you, and the coins you love will be formally on the stage of the world. Wealth, status, reputation, prestige... These are going to be in your arms, yes, just by voting.
And vote, we can do it for you. We deal with all 2000 people in the CoinEx community to help you achieve this great ideal, help you make the SPRK currency break through the last doorsill, go on the market, become a member of the exchange, and become a bright road to wealth.
Do you think so?
One step forward is to go all the way, and to take a step backward is to lose all of you and stand still at the door of success.
Ask again, through this vote, push the door of CoinEx exchange, do you want to?
If you have this idea, please contact us. Your competitors are on the way.";"";"";
