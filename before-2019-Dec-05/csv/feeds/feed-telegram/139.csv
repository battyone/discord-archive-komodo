Komodo notarizations to BTC happen every 10 minutes, so while it's likely that the transaction would be notarized sooner than 10 minutes, 10 confirmations (roughly 10 minutes) would ensure it. As soon as the hash of the transaction is notarized, they can't 51% attack the chain. So if you accept large amounts of money, I'd say 10 confirmations. Smaller amounts I'd say 1, as it would cost way more to try and 51% attack, and fail anyway, just to get your $20 back";"";"";

The only way to get money in and out is to sell your coins and then making a withdrawal for USD.  Kinda pointless for those of us in crypto.   I‚Äôm familiar with the standard ACH process but the wait times have been excessive for both buying and now selling. (re @Regnar: I cant speak for CRED, I'm not a rep for them or anything but from what I see their payment processor is Plaid which is pretty standard in banking and fintech apps. So Plaid authenticates account data which makes ACH transfers easier/faster but pulls from your account (not plaid or CRED) are still processed by ACH. Which does take days (kinda why we're all in crypto) so no surprise on the wait time there, companies like Coinbase have insane amounts of USD and Crypto which they basically front you the amount for the days while the backend transactions are actually happening. CRED probably doesn't have that money yet.
I'm not sure what you mean move Komodo to KMD wallet, but I dont have the app. I dont know what they do with sell requests though. But 12 days seems like a lot.)";"";"";
