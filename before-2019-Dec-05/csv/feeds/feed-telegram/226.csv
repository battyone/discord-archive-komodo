Different blockchains mine blocks at different speeds, bitcoin roughly 10 minutes, Komodo roughly 1 minute. Others are different too. It does have an effect on how big the blockchain gets itself which causes problems for Ethereum, but Komodo uses multi chains so you dont need to sync all the chains.
