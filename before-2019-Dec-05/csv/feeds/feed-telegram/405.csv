"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Oct-19 12:09 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> I'm curious if Binance is handling transactions that don't have locktime set. The rewards only accrue if locktime is set, Ledger I don't believe sets it on outbound transactions (all Komodo ecosystem wallets do set this) and so the transaction wouldn't accrue any rewards, so Binance may not have given you any more than the 7.
I'm guessing the first rewards airdrop Binance did was not the same as reward accruing. They probably just distributed past earnings to everyone who has a balance (I think they even said if you had even 1 KMD you would get rewards) but that isn't how the Komodo rewards works (re @Buralux: Check)";"";"";
