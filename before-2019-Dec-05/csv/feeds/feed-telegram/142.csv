This is using Komodos MoMoM tech. Other coins that build with Komodo can scale in the same way and are not limited to KMD itself, and can change mining algorithms, block sizes, coin amounts etc. I'm not 100% on the amount of tx/s that can be handled on each chain, but it's being worked on for a way that automatically spawns new chains as TX amount/demand increases, and each new chain secured by dPoW. I believe that last tests had 20,000 tx/s
