(re @Regnar: We, as community members, must participate more actively in the marketing efforts put out by the team, and must do what we can to spread Komodo outside of our community and circles. 80K interactions per post means very little if those 80K interactions are already followers of KMD and hodlers, we need unique interactions and new eyes on the project to truly see what it's about. That takes things like retweeting, liking, sharing, and tagging your favorite crypto influencers on the posts. it also takes finding posts where Komodo fits the topic, inserting intelligent and targeted tweets on those posts, and having the community come in and like bomb the post so everyone around that post sees it, and the strong community. So if you see a post where Komodo fits, insert something intelligent (not spam) that shows how KMD can help (ie. a coin page says ""we in discussions on how to become more resilient to 51% attacks"" and you insert a link of Gamecredits using Komodo to do just that) tag Komodoplatform and then post it here and try to get the community to like and retweet your post. That's what I believe we need on the social media front. community involvement.)";"";"";

When I saw the current state of the market and certain dev teams just going silent I figured the cannibalization of certain companies may be happening.
I knew KMD has been continuing to push through this down market and that‚Äôs fantastic. 
It was only a matter of time before the market started to see through hype and that may be a boon for KMD once investor reactions switch to proof of technology over who has the best hype team.
Still holding my KMD so nice to see that even in this market we are continuing to push the envelope.
