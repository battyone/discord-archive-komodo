If there is that much KMD sitting on the exchange with the highest price, they could easily sell KMD for BTC, send the BTC to another exchange with lower price and Buy KMD there. A single arbitrage to pull 10% gains and get more KMD.
The reverse (selling on Binance from other wallets) doesn't work, but we could and should see one way arbitrage that shows more selling pressure in Binance and buying pressure elsewhere. (re @EPIDEMIC_media: You cant sell anywhere thats showing the best price unless you have KMD on exchange. Thats why this run is a mirage. A true run allows you to liquidate on demand)";"";"";

I just said there should be arbitrage driving the price down on Binance and up on other exchanges (equalizing below current price by selling the coins that are still on Binance, there's close to 10M, and rebuying on cheaper exchange.) That would be a guaranteed profit in BTC with the same amount of KMD holdings, or ending with more KMD. But it isn't happening right now.
People are FULLY acknowledging the price discrepancy due to Binance disabling deposits, but aren't narrow minded enough to think that is the sole reason for price increasing.

Implying what? That someone deliberately disabled Binance wallets to pump the price on a single exchange?

HOWEVER
As a casual investor and potential user I found it sobering.
I had seen people posting on Twitter and YouTube about how awesome atomDEX is. 
The crypto community is sleeping on the fact that the holy Grail of crypto aka a LEGIT dex is already here! 
Just a matter of time until people notice!
I was hyped! 
Then I tried it out. Almost unusable. I'm not talking about how it was overwhelmed by 160(!?) testers.  Problem is, there are absolutely no features at the moment, not even a public orderbook. Things I didn't even think were features, like charts, just aren't there yet.
To be clear, I dont blame the team because my favorite idiot Twitter personalities over promise. 
But here is how I felt after the test: 
""This needs probably 6 months to be ready for prime time, and probably a few months after that to start catching on. Meanwhile you have like 50 competitors trying to lauch their DEX in the same time frame. Not to mention the possibility that people just stick with central exchanges.
""KMD has been bleeding for 18, 20 months, maybe longer. I don't expect that to change before they deliver cool, speculator friendly stuff. I mean, look at what's happening in the ETH ecosystem, all their defi stuff. Derivatives, lending, oracle's, tons of stuff. In 9 months KMD will have a sweet DEX (we hope) but some of these other ecosystems might have X Y and Z by then, on top of various decentralized exchanges.""
Anyway I decided to hold my KMD after the stress test, but count me skeptical on november's 500 to 1300 pump.";"";"";
