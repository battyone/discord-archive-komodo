Also fighting for a pool of speculators is what only speculators say, they aren't even the target market of Komodo and tons of other crypto. 
Timing is everything, and Komodo missed the boat? Yuppp just ask AOL, Netscape, Ask Jeeves, AltaVista, GeoCities, and countless others.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"24-Apr-19 07:15 AM";"[telegram] <barbierir> this point implies that blockchain tech has no other use case than speculation, that existing network effects and money trump everything else. So it's better to extract as much gainz as possible and exit before it all crashes down in due time. The other theory is that it has real use cases and that it all seems equal, for now, only because no project has scaled to mass use (yet). Ethereum has a lot of momentum but even the best case for Eth 2.0 is orders of magnitude worse than Komodo for real world use. Eventually if people want to build real stuff they'll need to use what actually works. They won't spend 10x time, money and effort when they can do the same for 1x. The reactions seen by people when they discover Komodo tells it all. When all pieces are in place, it will shine.
