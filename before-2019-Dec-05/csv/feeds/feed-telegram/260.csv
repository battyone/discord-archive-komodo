(re @Regnar: Komodo DEX is all powered by Atomic swaps, so order matching and fulfillment is very fast in the new engine, each coin is still subject to those coin's blockchain rules. So you swapping KMD for ZILLA will be very fast to receive confirmations, KMD to BTC will still have to wait for BTC confirmations, however the coins will appear in your wallet immediately as they wait for confirmations)";"";"";
