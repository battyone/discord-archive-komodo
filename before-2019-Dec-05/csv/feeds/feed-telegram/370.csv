Not enough demand for KMD because there aren't enough needs for it like ETH or BNB. JL777 article is great, but in my mind I just don't see 5k KMD or trading pairs on low volume exchanges as creating enough of a network effect. Even the dex won't require KMD for swaps if I recall. I appreciate the philosophy and am still bullish, just not as bullish as I would be with slightly more use of the coin. Doesn't have to be a tax, but maybe creating some more services people can voluntarily utilize if they want and make them use KMD. It's just not right to see so many lesser projects above Komodo on the cmc rankings and it's mainly due to market making and other stuff we could improve on I guess.";"";"";
