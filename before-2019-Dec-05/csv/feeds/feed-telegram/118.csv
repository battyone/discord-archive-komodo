Also being built on BarterDEX is HyperDEX which is only in Alpha. So low volume currently isn't really a problem, especially in a bear market. There is a lot of work being done to make it much more user friendly and speed up swap times, create liquidity providers, etc to help facilitate more volume. It's still in Beta though.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"27-Aug-18 01:18 AM";"[telegram] <Regnar> But for example of why they do this we can look at Kraken who said ""Reducing the price precision will help reduce extraneous activity in the order books as traders continually jump in front of each other by a very small fraction, resulting in a higher volume of canceled (unfilled) orders. We have received many requests from clients for this reduction and it will help reduce load on the trade engine with more efficient order books."" Not sure what HitBTCs reason is. 
But if you would like changes, you should definitely contact them directly, it means more coming from their actual customers. (re @Long: With that number of decimals, no trading, please negotiate with them, we paid fee not for no volume)";"";"";
