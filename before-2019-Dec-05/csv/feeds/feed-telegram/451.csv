decentralized nature of blockchain makes cryptocurrency theoretically immune to the old ways of government control and interference. Cryptocurrencies make it easier to conduct any transactions, for transfers are simplified through use of public and private keys for security and privacy purposes. These transfers can be done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by traditional financial institutions.However, the latest news on cryptocurrencies indicates that because cryptocurrencies are devoid of a central repository, a digital cryptocurrency balance can be wiped out by a computer crash, a hack, and other unexpected events.";"";"";

Decrypt interviewed Komodo CTO Kadan Stadelmann about the inherent risks centralized exchanges face, being attacked by malicious actors and also by authorities.
Undoubtedly, one of the overarching trends of 2020 will be the rise of decentralized exchanges, like AtomicDEX.
AtomicDEX is fully non-custodial: you control your private keys, even when you trade one asset for another. We are progressing towards 1.0 with each beta release. This week we added Feathercoin, Turkish and Hungarian translations, and fixed a bunch of connectivity bugs.";"";"";
