A lot of people DM'ed me about it. It is a quite simple strategy. Our team had contact with various news channels. Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin. This gives our members a perfect window to sell their coins with a decent profit.
