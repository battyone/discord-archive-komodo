1) beware of coins with huge ROI and just recently launched! 😎
2) if you try to do it, after getting ROI, move the money elsewhere: either to BTC or another better established project or even back into fiat. Don't reinvest in the same coin before getting ROI!
3) After ROI you essentially have a free money printing machine at hand, so do with it as it pleases you! 😉 (re @JohDio: Sounds like I somethin I could dig into thanks man)";"";"";
