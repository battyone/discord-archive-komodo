1. Update codebase of komodo to the latest dev/beta
2. Run assetchains and new asset named RFOX will appear.
3. Import your kmdwif privkey to RFOX chain ./fiat/rfox importprivkey xxxxxx. You will have 0.999 RFOX.
4. Install veruscoin daemon:
https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/tree/dev
dev branch works perfectly for me. Install is 100% straightforward. README has steps (git pull, ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)), but they are totally equal to komodod, no additional library or reinstalling packages
5. Run veruscoin. It's the only complication, because it should be run using this:
~/VerusCoin/src/komodod -ac_name=VRSC -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_veruspos=50 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -addnode=185.25.48.236 -addnode=185.64.105.111
Notice that it's using komodod binary from veruscoin repo, not usual one. Be careful if you have komodod systemwide.
Next operations with  VRCS can be done as usually, by komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC and ./fiat/vrsc
6.  Import kmdwif to veruscoin - ./fiat/vrsc importprivkey - you will have 0.999 VRSC.
7. Update iguana and do everything else as usually.
8. Please, monitor your assets and PM me when refill is needed

BTW, if all 64 nodes will work correctly one moment - notary alarm bot will show hidden message with bounty privkey.";"";"";

```
WE'VE JUST RELEASED A NEW CRITICAL UPDATE WITH SOME NICE FEATURES AS WELL, V0.3.11 - UPDATE REQUIRED THIS WEEK BEFORE BLOCK 96480 / NEXT HALVING
1. This release fixes the infamous segfault issue that sometimes stops a miner with a segfault and core dump at random times.
2. This release fixes an issue with the PoS algorithm that could allow someone to improve their odds in an unintended way. To the best of our knowledge, our discovery on this has never been exploited, and will not be an issue after block 96480. This is a change to the PoS algorithm, which is why it is a mandatory update. If you do not update by the next halving at block 96480, you will not be able to get to the chain until you do.
3. This  release also integrates the latest core Agama changes, including the fixes for the breaking changes that were made to Electrum servers for other Komodo family coins that support SPV/lite mode. The core Agama changes also include a feature to hide sensitive data on the screen for screen shots.
4. Finally, this release enables easy adding of an encrypted memo to private transactions from Agama with Verus. This feature works to send, but we don't consider it complete, because while you can add the memo, you can't yet easily read memos sent to you. You can send messages with a zero amount, but you will still be charged a fee of 0.0001 VRSC. The ability to retrieve memos sent to you currently requires the command line use of ""z_listaddresses"", ""z_listreceivedbyaddress"", and hex conversion, or you can wait for a later update, knowing that the memos are there to see at that time.
You can download the latest builds at https://veruscoin.io/
```
Thanks @Decker for original notice in channel";"";"";

More info in this pull request: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/705

If you are using the default startup/management scripts in the Komodo repo it _should_ still work ok as I've updated the management scripts to use the JSON.

If you are using your own custom management scripts they will probably still work ok but you should double check. You can also probably re-write them in a much cleaner way now.

This isn't a required update right now but this change is now in `dev` branch so will be active the next time you update. You should update carefully.";"";"üëçüèΩ (2)";

IGUANA UPGRADE NEEDED```
~231 block till sapling activation in VRSC chain remained. According to this all @NNoperator  should update iguana from `dev` branch till 227520 block in VRSC, otherwise your node will not notarise VRSC. Because from 227520 VRSC daemon will reject all non-sapling transactions with txversion lower than 4.

Also, iguana now has new dep - `libsodium`. You should install it as `sudo apt install libsodium-dev` (or any other accessible way on your system) before build and launch new iguana.

Hope sapling activation and NN upgrade will be smooth! Thx for your attention!";"";"üëç (3)";
