the limit per VM would be MAX 128 coins.. and 64 would be much safer, 32 even better. some ppl already had issues starting coin daemons, with RPC port bound to something else. 
for scale test I managed 1024 coins, but had to firewall OS start coins, then iguana.
drop firewall. 
without that things would just fail to start, not being able to bind a port.";"";"";
