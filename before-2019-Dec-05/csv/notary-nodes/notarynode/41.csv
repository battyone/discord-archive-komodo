That gitbook tools seems really useful here as with it all candidates can push updates to the website independently. We will look into that more.

There is also a lot of content we could have on that website, and it is much more focused when it's sitting on its own site versus being on the main Komodo domain. On the new rebrand website we can have a short section about notary nodes / elections, and then link to the official election site/process (based on Github).

- You need to have folder named after your team (not `komodo-cats-team` but just `cats` - exactly as your node will be named in pubkeys list except region _XX) inside `notarynodes` folder. 
- This is not proposals listing, this is any team getinfo page, that will persist after elections. Way to get information on any node, team or operator. It doesn't matter if there are folders of team with  no nodes, with only proposal or from mature heads like badass. There is also my cat's page. Having folder there doesn't affect elections (not having it affects  :)
- Please, DO NOT remove non-yours old folders, do not touch proposals directory (some might need it to recover their old data), do not commit to other folders there or change files structure.

And you have to make page. It is one and only *official* source of candidates data.

Spoiler: pages deadline 1 april. Declaring automatic re-elected nodes between 1st and 14th apr. Votes airdrop 14th apr, voting deadline 14th may, hardforking pubkeys - mid june. 30 nodes will be re-elected, 30 nodes elected, 4 dev nodes.
