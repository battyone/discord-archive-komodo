If it doesn't work, send your beer somewhere on another addresss you create, delete your beer wallet.dat, delete the beer blockchain data, get the bootstrap (https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/BEER-bootstrap.tar.gz) start beer with your pubkey and import your privkey without rescanning (adding """" false right after your importprivkey command like this:
```CSS
komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER importprivkey YOURPRIVKEYHERE """" false

Then you will send back the BEER you sent to your other address to fund your BEER NN address because without the rescan it will be empty. Then split your fund to get utxo. Then run the above command above to see if it fixed something.";"";"";
