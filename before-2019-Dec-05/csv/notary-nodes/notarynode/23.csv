To do that, you'd want to use haraka* and verus_hash.* from the crypto directory, and to move SerializeVerusHash and VerusHashWriter from hash.h in the src directory to your hash.h. You should also copy the hash function pointer and selection from CBlockHeader to support portability and performance and make it easier to port. Then, at runtime, just make sure to call CVerusHash::Init() and select your hash function to set the function pointer. Of course, with a height dependent change, you may want the main hash function for CBlockHeader to just select between what you use now and VerusHash. I think that would cover everything.```";"";"";
