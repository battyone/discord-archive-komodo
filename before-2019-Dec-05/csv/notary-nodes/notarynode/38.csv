Pirate wants to support the NN network. 
Last year I personally considered running but was hesitant and did not trust my technical ability, so instead I just ran a handful of Giveaways and raffles of my and community donated funds to those who supported the dICOs.  
This year, I have been a proponent of KMD, worked with other projects to bring light and awareness to the people.  I have been changing thought leaders minds on KMD and the whole project.   As you may know, there were many in the community who were not happy about the inception of KMD... but those people are being talked to weekly/monthly by myself when discussing Pirate and KMD ecosystem. 

This year, we are running on a platform of Privacy, z address adoption/usage and ecosystem support.  
Attached is our preliminary distribution ideas for Notary Node income.  
TBH, I probably won't see shit... I hope Lynch is compensated appropriately for his time and management. 

The main purpose is to keep supporting KMD, it's ecosystem, those who helped with the foundation of pirate and to give back to the community as we have been with Plugins, tipbots and so on.";"";"";

Regarding static page vs wordpress... honestly I'm not the best persont to judge which route to take. My understanding is that it's easier to update content to a WP site than to a staic one, and we probably have to keep iterating the content on this page especially if we reuse it in 2020.";"";"";
