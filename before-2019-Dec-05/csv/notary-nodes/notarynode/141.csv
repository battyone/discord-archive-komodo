BODY LANGUAGE OF THE GREEN IGUANA

Various things to notice:
1) BODY POSTURE and MOVEMENT, 
2) EYES DIRECTION, EYE LID SHAPE and ACTIVITY, 
3) TONGUE ACTIVITY, 

There is a body language that iguanas have and it is of the utmost importance to learn it to properly read and understand what's on the iguana's mind, so you are able to accurately know it's every mood and attitude from moment to moment. You can tell if the iguana is calm and relaxed or scared and ready to run or ready to bite and whip instead or wants to have sex and mate or that he's suddenly taken on a scary change in character and become so serious and angry, and wants to go to war with you exactly as he would act if he sees another male iguana. 

When observing the iguana's body signs and activity, you must learn to distinguish between things that are temporary and changes of the moment as opposed to it's regular moods and behavior in general.

Unlike most other RPC methods, z_mergetoaddress operates over a particular quantity of UTXOs and notes, instead of a particular amount of ZEC. By default, it will merge 50 UTXOs and 10 notes at a time; these limits can be adjusted with the parameters transparent_limit and shielded_limit.

z_mergetoaddress also returns the number of UTXOs and notes remaining in the given addresses, which can be used to automate the merging process (for example, merging until the number of UTXOs falls below some value).

UTXO memory accounting
The default -dbcache has been changed in this release to 450MiB. Users can set -dbcache to a higher value (e.g. to keep the UTXO set more fully cached in memory). Users on low-memory systems (such as systems with 1GB or less) should consider specifying a lower value for this parameter.
```
I just read this in the Zcash doc. Could it mean that setting a higher  -dbcache could allow us to let the utxo amount be much higher. The 450MiB default seems really low. Also to merge more utxo at a time with z_merge, we just need to set a higher transparent_limit and we could z_merge everything in one go? Anyone tried it?";"";"";
