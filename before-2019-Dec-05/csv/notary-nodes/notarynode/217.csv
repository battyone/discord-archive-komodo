There is a proposal aimed at streamlining NotaryNode Consensus reaching discussion and your thoughts and ideas would be appreciated.
http://pad.supernet.org/p/KMD_NN_Group_Consensus_Proposal
``` Problem
 
- circular discussion (infinite loop) 
- devolution into personalization of issues
- issues never satisfactorily finalized leading to carryover into later, unrelated issues
 
 
Goal
 
To develop a basic framework to facilitate Notary Node operators in reaching an informed `Group Consensus` that focuses on the issues involved, not the personalities of those participating, and optimized the path to reaching a mutually acceptable, if not agreeable, result. ```";"";"";
