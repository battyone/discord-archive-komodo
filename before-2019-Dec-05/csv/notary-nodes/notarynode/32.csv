reason i think it's related to this is the pioneers NN wallet was -50 to -100KMD for a while.  side note, a rollover wallet sometimes tops up the NN wallet to do notarizations.  When these mature block rewards are accounted for but not spendable because they don't have `nLockTime` set.   <--- too low level for me to hand-on-heart say i'm an expert on behaviour without someone blessing my assumption with ""yes you are correct mylo"" or ""derrr mylo, you are so wrong"" üòÑ";"";"";
