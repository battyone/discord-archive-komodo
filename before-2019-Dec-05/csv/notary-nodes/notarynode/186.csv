I personally believe that the more new notaries, the more new and exciting people/teams will be able to devote time to the KMD ecosystem (although as proven by a lot of people in here, not being a NN doesnt proclude you from inputting into to the ecosystem). Having multiple nodes would also aid some people to devoting almost full time work to the ecosystem which I see as the main benefit or reason to vote somebody, or some specific project in for multiple nodes.
My personal opinion for the question I posed just before is that if you're ""running"" a node for somebody or some team, you are apart of that team, therefor, you shouldnt be able to run for another node, personally or with another team.";"";"";

If Notary Node ""sysadmins"" are allowed, it will pave the way of a select few actually knowing how to run NN's who are paid by teams to run the nodes for them. Isnt the whole idea of having 4 regions with different node operators to decentralise the notarisation process. If what you're saying is allowed. You could have a single region where 1 person ""sysadmins"" every single node in that region. This could actually happen if people didnt know the team they were voting for hired someone to run their node for them.";"";"👍 (1)";
