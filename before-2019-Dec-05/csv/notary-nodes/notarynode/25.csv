Each notary node's pubkey is hardcoded into the consensus rules to allow us to mine at a low difficulty; which when mining 24/7/365 equates to roughly 20k KMD a year in mining rewards.

There are 64 notaries spread geographically across 4 regions (16 notaries per region). Only the top 8 nodes with the most notarisations from each region will keep their positions next year. The bottom 8 will lose their position and will have to campaign to be re-elected along with any other member of the public.

The incentive is to keep the position. There is quite a lot of competition between the operators coming up with all sorts of insane optimisations to try and increase their notarisation counts.";"";"üëç (2)";
