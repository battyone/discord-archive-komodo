For those who think they own things, ask yourself, at what point do you own the air you breathe? At what point do you own the water that you drink then evaporates as sweat? The food that you eat actually never touches your stomach! 
Saying people are weak or strong is easy, can you go to a house that knows no sorrow? The problems that we face will abound endlessly in different times because free will exists, attempting to smash it out will never succeed because imo you cannot kill an idea. You cannot control thought, you may influence it yet the more you squeeze you fist the more leaks from your fingers. I believe life will always strive to survive.
