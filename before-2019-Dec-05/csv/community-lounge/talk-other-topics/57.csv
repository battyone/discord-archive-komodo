@Cryptoon to that end, I don't entirely disagree
but any claim that man is ""harming the planet"" (and not just harming man) irks the shit out of me because it's always abstract and can never be validated (specifically to the extent of being unable to state what the climate ""should be"" - because ""I don't know what it should be, I just know that it should be this"" isn't science)";"";"";
