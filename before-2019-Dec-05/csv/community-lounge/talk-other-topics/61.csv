*Airdrop* **arrrrdrop**

For the fellow Komodians and Pirates in this channel, I am offering an airdrop of OUR tokens (OCryptoUnion)
OCU has rececntly acquired ZADDEX/ZEX  and we are well on the way of opening fiat gateways for komodo ecosystem coins as well as other projects.

OCU are focusing on Crypto to Fiat loans, traditional banking instruments, launchpad and VC with startup companies in Ivory coast (exclusive partnership with their largest SME and government) as well as many other aspects.

Due to the overwhelming amount of newcomers, I will need to constantly change the airdrop amount, but as of now can offer 2000 OUR tokens to anyone who wishes to join the discord üòÉ 

Active komodo devs/community support members will receive a bonus, as a thanks for working so hard on our favourite platform!

Can the glass transafer part of this  be used to create a truly offline laptop for coldstorage?

The way I think it can work:
- Buy a good laptop like a thinkpad
- Install a linux variant OS from a trusted source
- Download a crypto wallet that supports offline creation of keys and signing transactions 
- Physically remove Wifi adaptor, Ethernet , USB ports
- leave the camera as the only available input source
- Use through glass transfer to transfer the transaction data from online device to this offline device, sign it
- use the same thing to transfer the signed transaction back to the online device and publish it.
- this way there is no reason to worry about hardware wallets upgrading software in time or supporting whatever your favorite  Crypto coin/token we like";"";"";

Deleting unfavourable comments from a crypto subreddit isn‚Äôt all that surprising, especially given how much rabid coin holders want to protect their investments. But there‚Äôs ample evidence to suggest that the rampant censorship on r/bitcoin began only when the institutions arrived.

Those institutions are the financial backers behind Bitcoin‚Äôs leading development group ‚Äì Blockstream. They include AXA Venture Partners, an investment wing of AXA Group ‚Äì the second largest financial services firm in the world. Blockstream has helped guide the development of Bitcoin since 2016, and if you didn‚Äôt already know that, then it may be because the Overton window has been set up specifically so that you don‚Äôt.";"";"";
