Again, the Financial Times published a column in which the Libra is lit at the speed of light. the logic is interesting. they say it is difficult to help unbank people living in Africa, the Amazon, and the Philippines because they have to maintain offices that exchange Libra with real money. at first glance, it is convincing, but it shows that you don't understand the mess that's happening at all. bitcoin or blockchain is a trust game. when trust is secured, it becomes a value without exchanging money. bitcoin doesn't even exchange money.";"";"";
