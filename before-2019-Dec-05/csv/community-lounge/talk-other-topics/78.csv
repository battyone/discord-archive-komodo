of course, IT companies, not banks, can participate in financial innovation with blockchain as a weapon. however, issuing a stable coin that is linked to the dollar or yen requires a number of deposit accounts to be legally secured. otherwise, they will have to go through a banking network again in the process of collecting paper money from selling the staple coin, and it is uncertain whether the government will give them permission. If it is a bank, it is enough just to exchange the balance of the bank into a stable coin.

shares or real estate registrations of coded companies in blockchain are split up like tokens. shipped agricultural products, wine that has been bottled, and tuna caught are tokenized, which can be sold to an unspecified number of investors. at the same time that all assets are capitalised, the liquidity of all capital is immediately possible. another name for the blockchain is the trust network. In the end, blockchain dramatically increases the size of credit.";"";"";
