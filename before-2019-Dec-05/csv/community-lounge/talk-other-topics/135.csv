China prints money like the US -- straight out of thin air. The difference is, they subsidise industry (CCP party affiliates) while the US taxes companies into the dirt: ""Designed in California"". 

'Western pluralism'  (divide and conquer) is itself a PLA talking point that gets them access to economic, political and militarily relevant infrastructure. 

There is an engineered 'leadership crisis' in western democracies that may or may not resolve itself. 

Chinese actions are blatantly obvious in 2019.
