than when a social rift leads to an economic rift, economic cracks more often lead to social cracks. 
the problem is the timing, perhaps five years later, when look back at the world, I think people will nod and understand.

If about 150 of the 1000 global enterprises are Chinese enterprises, half of them are state-owned enterprises. 
I think half of them should already have been bankrupt. 
this distorted market structure and the existence of authoritarian dictatorship is a serious threat to us.

I think that the maximum amount that civilization can reach is in places where freedom coexists with order. usually, emphasis of order restrains freedom, and granting of liberty leads to disorder. United States has a lot of energy of free and Japan has a lot of energy of order. there is a fear of freedom and disorder in China.";"";"";

@Deleted User yes, China can't move forward unless it collapses. collapse of the communist regime is essential for future leap forward, and the collapse of the communist regime means considerable confusion. whether can get over the turmoil and move forward is real ability of China.";"";"";

When there is corruption you do not place intelligent and/or experienced people as important leaders of companies, cities and so on... you choose your family and friends. And they make stupid decisions. One of such is wrong investments, like building part of a city with trains, supermarkets, new houses ready for use by 100k people.... where nobody lives. Corruption (inside country) is not effectively spent money. Waste. This waste can be handled when economy is fine. When it is not fine - people will start noticing it more and more.";"";"";

(there are hopes for young people in China, but it will take a very long time.)

If the linked Xinhua report is correct, it is highly likely that the regulation that limited the term of Chinese President and his successor to a consecutive term will disappear. I think China will open up Xi Jinping's long-term rule and enter the hard-landing path at the same time. http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/25/c_136998770.htm

expect to experience hard landing by the end of 2019. It will be Japanese economy that sees the most profit in this situation.";"";"";
