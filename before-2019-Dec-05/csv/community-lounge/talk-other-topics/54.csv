Atomic swap are executed by the system. there is no need to stop because it is not policy. 

It is the basis of Atomic swap that can be reliably exchanged even when there is no third party intervention and the transaction is completely zero-knowledge. Bitcoin core developer announced in the fall of 2017 that they had succeeded in dealing with Atomic swap between Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Atomic swap is a key device in the side chain, a kind of adhesive that connects disparate blockchain to each other. In an online world that isn't face-to-face, you should eliminate the risk that your opponent won't send things for money. starting with an online bookstore, Amazon was also at the heart of the solution to eliminate this risk. beyond this risk is the foundation of business. If the blockchain ecosystem becomes huge and the atomic swap connect it, projects that have escrow as a basic function will inevitably face a crisis.

the claim of the Bitcoin maximalist, who claims that Bitcoin will ultimately destroy the financial giant, should be weighed from the perspective of an ecosystem in which blockchain are systemically closely connected.";"";"üíØ (1)";

but now is the beginning of the blockchain technology. It should be considered that there are too many things to be done and that there are many attempts to disappear in the near future. too much confidence in the vocabulary created by convenience can be confined to the maze of categories. the word sidechain is still a sketchy and ambiguous concept to be a category.";"";"üíØ (1)";

infrastructure of a company is now a social asset, and those belonging to a corporation are losing their civic identity and building the identity of their corporate employees.

consumers are no longer a one-time consumer, but as a subscriber for the enterprise, they are sensitive to the policies and identity of the enterprise. at the base of this phenomenon lies the issue of the public nature of cyber resources.

what they have is not just a matter of money. services they provide are becoming an essential infrastructure that exceeds essential services that nation has traditionally been in charge of, and so their authority is beyond that of public use.

nevertheless, it is difficult to bring this infrastructure into the public domain. existing public domain does not have the expertise to understand and control this area. Rather, the flow will appear the other way round. platform will be the nation of future, enterprise will be government of future, and consumer will be a member of community and protection.

already, there are signs that the younger generation is feeling that the world. as soon as people who are ignorant of the construction and operation of offline systems, believe in contracts instead of laws, views instead of votes, and Wikipedia instead of universities as a source of knowledge, and build new economies among themselves without adapting to existing institutions, existing world will disappear without a trace.";"";"";
