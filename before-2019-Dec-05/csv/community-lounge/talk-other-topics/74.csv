We have also mapped out a scheme that could allow multiple blockchains to co-exist within the SingularityNET Agent world, but it's not at all sure that we will end up going this direction...I think after the Platform release they will do everything to be well known everywhere. Until then 200-300m and later on I hope way more 

Ben Goertzel 
""Response to some previous message: Of course, if a shift were made in future away from ERC20 or to a framework enabling a mix of blockchains, it would be done in a way that would preserve the proportional value of the current ERC20 AGI tokens... anything else would be wrong and ridiculous...About Hashgraph, i think this and other graph-based mechanisms are quite interesting, but Hashgraph right now is not free and open source sofware, which is not optimal from my view...I expect a bunch of other graph based approaches will emerge in the next years.And then of course there's our Anton Kolonin's Proof of Reputation scheme, which could be implemented as our own -chain- (more likely graph) or in partnership with another project. For smart contracts, I like the approach of our partner project Kirik.io ... formally verifiable/analyzable smart contracts ... fits naturally with AI ...The reason to have a cleanly layered software design is to be open to the best possibilities that emerge as things advance (as advance in this space is so rapid and unpredictable) ... but for the beta we are sticking with the blockchain-layer software that is most robust , best adopted and easiest to work with at the present moment..""Ben Goertzel";"";"";

If possible, it is a very special case and it is time to give up ideals little by little. So the courts and lawyers can rest assured. 

Even so, however, the passion for smart contract generated by blockchain is not meaningless. Although Ethereum does not make smart contract possible, there is a growing possibility that global companies, spurred by Ethereum, will build an ecosystem that partially complements. The fact that legislation to recognize blockchain-based smart contract as part of a contract is underway in many U.S. states is also an incomprehensible contradiction from the ideals of smart contract. However, it is highly likely that in the near future, mankind is not even aware that it is a smart contract while utilizing an industrialized smart contract.";"";"";
