here is our demo for ""Bitrophone"" project. Due to lack of sources we couldn't enable/create some features & get cloud servers, mail servers & licensing protocols for song uploads and payment screen... If we get funded for project we will use funding to get them and upgrade the website in future. But i think we created a cool thing as a demo version in less then a month with just 2 people. Also our admin panel, which you won't be able to see in this demo is almost ready. I wanted to mail you with a demo, now at least we got something to show & upgrade. We are still at %20 completion of being %100 ready for service.

In this demo you can see how will our music distribution service work, 
song upload panels(disabled uploads but works on backend. we don't have cloud :D), 
payment methods(we didn't enable credit card and kmd payments, only website credits are usable to purchase in demo),
Released albums,

Where traditional business models may just have subscriptions, using cryptocurrencies, especially the komodo ecosystem #cc-pegs #cc-prices related tech in the upcoming years would enable a new business model.

For example, if an artist needs automated redistribution service & they are paying $20/month, in this type of business the platform could offer to invest 50% of the subscription fee into a peg fund and other type of algorithmic trading and derivative market.  Any profits from such diversification of income stream can be used to offset future monthly payments for the artist, or for the investor an added opportunity to get knock-on effects of this type of investment.

If music royalties exist, then as they are accumulated over quarters or 6-month intervals, the same could be diverted into a fund of kinds.

These income streams can all pour into kmd network services - doesn‚Äôt have to be specific to music platforms.   Just an idea that popped up middle of the night on how this platform can be used.";"";"ü§î (2),üíØ (2),üëå (1)";
