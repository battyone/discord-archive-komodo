and if you use the developer tools of the browser you can see why: every request to those elements that don't show up get a 403 (unauthorized) and they are asking for the captcha stuff, but that is not visible on the main site, only in the developer tools
would love to see Google charging 1$ for each request to their captchas, then this will stop for sure üôÇ";"";"";

There is a gaming-SDK currently being worked on.

If you‚Äôre going to make blackjack or any multiplayer gambling games, the CHIPS project is better for microtransactions between groups because of the network model of games (small groups of people).

If you‚Äôre going to build a platformer or rogue-like game, then using komodo and it‚Äôs token system will work for you.  All the calls are available by http RPC (not rest).   From a browser there is CORS limitation.   From standalone programs, no problem.

If you were to grab a game template from the unity asset store, adding token calls would be pretty trivial.

A lightweight P2P daemon is in development - this will likely replace needing to run a full node for taking advantage of the antara framework (application smarts on blockchain)";"";"";
