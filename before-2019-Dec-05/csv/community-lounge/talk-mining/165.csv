Make max block size 1/6 as big and allow each block to reference 6 parent blocks and make solve time 10 seconds.  Your mempool needs to place a 1 or 2 minute hold on txns before miners randomly choose them so that they don't choose the same txns too often.   Since you now have 6 blocks per minute  you can adjust difficulty 6x faster, or have it SQRT(6) more stable. Double-spending solution for DAGs that I came up with is that 1st txn (the valid one) is the one with the most decendant work, not the one with the most ancestor work.  Someone should do a patent on that.  There is a no-incest aka no triagles rule in the connections. I think that means primarily  parents of the same block can have the each other as a parent.  to get even more fancy, each miner chooses his own target but the amount of coin he gets is determined by the DA.  The DA erward is per hash instead of per block.  So no need for pools.  Then you use VDF-POS to make it constant value and not need a bunch of mining equipment to be secure, but only use POW for generating and distribution coin with the above self-hashing txns.  Then put a bunch of these coins under the KMD umbrella so that merchannts only need to communicate with KMD, so all the sub coins are shards.  20 seconds txns, unlimited txns, no wasted minning for consensus, constant value, secured by BTC.";"";"";
