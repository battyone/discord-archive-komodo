Winners, please contact @NutellaLicka a on the Pirate Discord if you'd like it !arrrtip to you directly(you will need to prove it is your address by setting a miner.name to a word of my choosing), otherwise I will be sending these addresses the ARRR on the 7th of January via an !arrrtip withdrawal in the #mining channel! We appreciate your use of the pool and would love to hear your thoughts on pool improvements.

Costs to maintain pool up ( 5 dedicated servers) it's more expensive. 
I supported Komodo project since start with my pool but keep it open for 30 miners it has become unsustainable.
Shutdown planned on 4th ( tomorrow morning ) at 11:00 AM  - CET
Thanks to all those who supported the pool and komodo developers for this big project
