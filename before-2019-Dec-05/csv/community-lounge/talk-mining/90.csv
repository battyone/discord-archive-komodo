Zcash planned ""growth stages"" along the lines of a tree's growth (sprout, overwinter, sapling), sapling is the current growth stage and encompasses many changes
if you keep your coins in transparent addresses, updates for all coins should be almost seamless; if you keep them in private/z addresses, you'll need to migrate from stage to stage however each coin decides";"";"";

Many tasks done and others features added during this night to keep pool updated, fast, secure and  first of all scalable  
- added mysql support to store all datas with redis db sync and nodejs, in this way if redis will be huge and huge like now, it's possible to flush it without lost datas 
- separate stratum from frontend on another independent server and speed up realtime datas 
- sync redis across other 2  servers to save data using sentinel ( master, slave x3  ad db replication) 
- pool run with minimal requirements but now it's more power with half of resources 
Sorry for some downtime during this night but it was necessary to keep pool up and fast
