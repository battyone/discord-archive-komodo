First off never send any crypto to eBay sellers! I’m sitting chomping at the bits to get a Z11 because I want to my mining op to grow, so I venture over to eBay because all z11’s are sold out. I see this ad and buy the machine because this guy has great reviews but he wants to be paid in crypto, at first I find it strange but then again I have bought so many machines from bitmain that it doesn’t seem that odd. Long story short this guy says the listing was never his and basically I sent my btc to a scammer address either it be him or someone that “hacked” his eBay account.
