@Ondalf I'm not sure how/why you dragged yourself into an elongated months-long conversation, but....
While I always welcome valuable input, pointing to the pool that's the cause of the topic as an example isn't that. This entire feken conversation started because zpool had the equihash bits and crackerz wanted to pay someone to write KMD into his pool but he refused to share the equihash bits.
In other words, he wanted someone to start with less than he already and redo everything he already had, blind.";"";"";
