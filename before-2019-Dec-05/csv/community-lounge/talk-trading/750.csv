from what i can tell, the vast majority fall into the above category. i will use the blockchain to prove that the repayment has been made. after this first phase of repayments, the number of claimants will be much reduced, but there will still be a lot of KMD left to payout. the second phase will deal with swept funds that are big, but are uncontested. so make sure to fill out your form ASAP.

the third phase will deal with funds that were stolen. at that point all that will be left are the disputed addresses, which will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

the sooner we can complete the refund process the better, so my goal is to complete all phases other than dispute resolutions by the end of this month, but with vast majority of cases before june 15th. thank you for your patience.";"";"";

1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done. 

Please dont expect any refund payments until june 15, maybe i can get it done sooner, but step 3 is a LOT of custom code that cannot have any errors";"";"üëç (6),Komodo (6)";
