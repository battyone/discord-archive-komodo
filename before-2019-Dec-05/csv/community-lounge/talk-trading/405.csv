99.9999999% of the time, yes
Most hashrate increases are coupled with non-nodes mining in public pools and consensus is entirely unaffected

you're conflating concepts
`So if you suddenly gain over 50% of the hashrate, that doesn't change consensus at all?`
If, as stated previously, that increase stays with the same 1 node then , no, that doesn't change consensus at all (not even the slightest bit). If this is consusing to you, then I suggest you look up what ""consensus"" is/means and how it works.
`Besides, I wasn't originally talking about consensus within a single blockchain, but consensus about which blockchain is the real or ""best"" one.`
Again, this is at best a skewed concept.
>Bitcoing is the best because Bitcoin is the best, even when it's not
leads to the inability for any other coin to ever be ""the best"".
 `It seems that the answer is whichever one has the highest hashrate`
Even to that end, other algos have different means of measurement. By that hashrate measurement alone concept, VRSC is 42x ""better"" than ZEC and has a difficulty 3307x harder than KMD, so everything in the equihash realm is shit and we should just all dump it all and bow to VRSC as our new god";"";"";
