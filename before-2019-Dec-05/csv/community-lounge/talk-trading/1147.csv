I thought bcash doesn't matter. It doesn't solve anything. It's the same shit as btc plus roger ver in it. We need something better. BTC need to be dethroned. It's not good for anything other than trading against alts. It was nice to cash out something in christmas time 2017, but my hatred only grew in spring 2018 when bear market began. It's fucken disheartening to look how better projects are being treated in this market. Only Binance and money printing scam ieo's make any money now days. Absolutely sickening. Fuck buidl and BNB. It's ridiculous to even think that bnb is any kind of sound money. Fucking chinese exchange token that you can buy fish&chips. What delusional bunch of scammers. Binance must be dethroned too. Ethereum had it's run. So shitty, but so high mcap. It's clogged as fuck. 2nd layer bs solution will not save eth. Time to replace it with something better. No mercy. They don't show mercy to us either. It's about the fight for survival now. sry for my shty eng. üôÇ";"";"";
