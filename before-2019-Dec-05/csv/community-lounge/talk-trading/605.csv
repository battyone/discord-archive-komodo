I'll give a TL:DR Komodo has been doing the ""focus on tech"" meme that you hear all so often and they've just gotten to the part where they are starting marketing. Right now they're currently going through a re-branding and they're upgrading their apps/ barter dexs UI and overall use to be more user friendly for people who aren't techy.

RED Fox Lab an IEO ontop of KMD (The twitter I linked) is suppose to be to KMD what Red hat Labs was to Linux. Since Komodo is a decentralized project and there's no CEO or a core person that can connect businesses. Red Fox Labs does that, they start projects then bring people in from the industry of those projects to take over. Point is Komodo is just getting the ball rolling on marketing and implementing itself";"";"";
