"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"09-Jun-19 10:29 AM";"to be clear, if your address had less than 777 KMD swept, and you didnt receive a refund, but you received the dust to the old address. the holdup for the refund is the transaction you need to send from the old address to the new address: 

https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

I will run the refund processor daily for a while, so if you dont get your tx done before i start the refund processor, you will need to wait another day. Also if you have a larger amount, we need to wait a bit more time to make sure there are no disputes. and if your funds were not swept, but stolen, you need to wait and additional week.

it does take a long time to run the refund processor as i didnt code it for efficiency. i will process progressively larger and larger amounts during the week and will post the most recent cutoff value. that way you dont have to keep asking when your refund will be processed. until you send in your dust tx from old address to new address and i process refunds bigger than your refund, your refund wont be processed.";"";"❤ (2)";

all clean refunds for less than 7777 KMD has been processed
there will be daily batches
make sure the dust payment sent to your old address has 'S' in the explorer for your old address. if not, that means you did not send it to the new address. send all funds to the new address to solve this
if you did not get the early refund, that means you missed the cutoff yesterday, or made multiple claims or your address is contested or it is over 7777 KMD
