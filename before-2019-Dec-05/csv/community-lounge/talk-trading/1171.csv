is syscoin still a thing? goes to check cmc
... jeez .. I can't make anything out of the gobbledigook there- I remember syscoin was aiming to become a blockchain marketplace- what happened to that?""
Pretty much what happens to every project making bold statements and never delivering to the scale at which it aims to deliver""

Not so much.  Syscoin delivered mainnet w/ marketplace initially way back in 2014, and did evolve it forward with Blockmarket before pursuing refactored design.  ""Never delivering to the scale at which it aims"" is a little ironic to read. ""Never"" is a strong word considering Syscoin 3 and 4 releases delivered their intended purpose - a streamlined blockchain and protocol for supporting services at scale. If Syscoin GitHub wasn't very active, I'd be satisfied with your statement, but it's busy. That team through its own experience as well as client interactions seems to have learned a lot in the past several years in regard to what does and does not belong on a blockchain. Apparently that's something a lot of other projects are still coming to terms with, with some even trying to implement many of the same things Syscoin already did and later determined were bloat factors best handled in other ways (e.g. ""Aliases"" and a range of other native smart contracts onchain). Decentralized service at enterprise scale demands quite a bit of innovation and groundwork. They're still producing.";"";"";
