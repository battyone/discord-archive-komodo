Our statistics show a near 100% swap success rate. @meatspoon we actually already had a few demos previously - and all these swaps were 100% successful. Speaking technically - no funds were ""lost"" during any trades - IF a swap failed and the coins did not make it through please contact our support team which can help you resolve your specific problem. In rare occasions coins can get stuck (but not lost) when you for example go offline (or other reasons for interruptions) during a cross-chain atomic swap and cause a timeout. But rest assured that the coins are not lost. We are already working on a automagic ""recover_funds_of_swap"" mechanims to automate this process and turn it ""grandma friendly"" so that GUI users won't have to do this manually or contact support for help. However, this is still an ongoing beta stage - so these sort of things are expected and just help us bring AtomicDEX to perfection.";"";"üíØ (13)";
