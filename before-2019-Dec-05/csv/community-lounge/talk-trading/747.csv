But look at our Komodo heroes here - the exploitation was quickly discovered and brought out in the open; the security team saved a lot of people losing their funds by taking action immediately. Working their butts off, and everyone is collaborating; many of my fellow ecosystem developers reached out to each other. 

Some of you feel irritated, fear of horrible things happening. But the Komodo Team has always been resourceful. They have been at it non-stop. Here are at K64, they got our full support, our full confidence and heck, we will help to make ends meet. Do not worry. Just follow the good advice given from the posts; move your funds from Agama. Check your balance and verify if it was protected, use the form.
