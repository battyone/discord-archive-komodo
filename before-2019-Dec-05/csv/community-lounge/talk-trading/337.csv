My point was:  for most people, BTC or BCH wont pay any of their bills.  So to say BCH is wildly better as a payment method isn't saying much.

But to correct you a bit, if you are in a western nation, you use fiat to pay sales tax anytime you use cash, you pay property and real estate taxes in fiat, you fuel your car with fiat, you buy clothes for your family in fiat, you pay traffic tickets in fiat...  I mean, it goes on and on.  I realize that there is a pressure to be like, super-cool crypto-dude who doesn't live in the fiat roach motel of modern day finance, but to say you ""rarely use fiat for anything"" makes me wonder if my world view is so incredibly backwards or if you are just spouting ""hardcore crypto"" things.
