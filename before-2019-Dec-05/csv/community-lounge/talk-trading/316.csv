It's simplification as it also is getting value to gold or maybe other assets. It may also be that USD is most common ""intermediate moeny"" like BTC is for alts, so if you like to cash out your alt first you buy BTC so it value should grow (if globally users cash out alts). So when in global economy ventures cash out USD could grow for a moment. Until financial guys realize that all fiat are overvalued and overall system collapses. Still it such case will be better to have USD/EUR then some funny money. But probably even better to own land and gold.";"";"";

I deliver if other guys who promised me to deliver will do that later. Then in time some % of such deals comes to default.
