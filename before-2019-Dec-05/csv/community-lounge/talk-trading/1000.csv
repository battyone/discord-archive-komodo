It's possible @jl777c are close to completing it.    It's a tremendous advancement in DAs for 3 reasons.  First, I'm happy someone like JL was familar with my work on changing difficulty during the block. This idea goes back to a medium article by Andrew Stone (BTC Unlimited).   This was  the only way to unstick  1E6 hashrate increase problems.  1E6 required a lot more than a linear downward adjustment for long solvetimes. So JL was trying N^2.  But that decreases too quickly.  I knew to use 2^x aka e^x aka 3^x.   But like I was saying, things need to be symmetric which means we need to be able to rise as fast as we fall or a big attacker can get too many blocks way too quickly with persistent oscillations.  The 2^x function  can resolve enormous jumps in only 30 or so bocks.  I thought of small-window SMAs thought could do it without causing other problems.  I spent a lot of time in the past on these kind of increases  So we can rise and fall in response to any size hash attack in about 30 blocks, apparently being pretty symmetrica (30 blocks to rise, 30 blocks to fall) .  By any size I mean a 1 billion times increase in hashrate takes 50 blocks to fix whereas Zcash's default digishiled (that this still uses for normal hashrates) takes 500 blocks to address a 1000x increase.    It's nice working with JL because I didn't have to look at the code.";"";"";
