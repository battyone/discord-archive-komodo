Pungo reminds me of Supernet.   All avenues of revenue from Peer2Group activities are funneled back into the Pungo Buyback fund.  

One of the drivers for me was their self confidence.   The desire to become owners of their own product based on the fruits of their labor :
You can basically sell your tokens back to the Pungo Group through a fund setup from these revenues mentioned above.     
The buybacks in turn make remaining tokens valuable.    Peer2 has the reloadable debit card already up, running and in use.  They have Peer2Cloud and Peer2Cash which will be part of the Pungo ecosystem.  

It really just feels like a way for them to crowdfund the 3.5 Million they will need to develop this and deploy it and they are willing to share in the ride, but unlike other ICO's, they have working products and future revenue streams / growth in sight.";"";"";
