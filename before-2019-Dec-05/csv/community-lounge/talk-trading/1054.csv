We from Komodo have unfortunately not been able to validate K64's claims about a 78M EUR investment from Goldman Sachs. We have approached Goldman Sachs but were unable to verify these claims. Publicly available data also suggests Komodore64 does not meet the requirements in order to qualify for such an investment. We publicly distance from K64 and want to point out that at no time has the Komodo team been involved in these activities. Please be cautious and do your own due diligence before investing in any project.```";"";"üòû (2),üëç (2)";
