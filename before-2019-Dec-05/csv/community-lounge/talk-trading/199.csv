DBX uses a Data Storage Side-Chain to support the main chain for more simultanous management of transactions. Projects as EOS are also reaching hundreds of thousands of transactions with the use of Side-Chains, however due to our DDPoS Consensus Mechanism that uses passive voting the DBXChain can manage transaction much faster and more efficient. DBX project started already in 2016, however we chose to not have any funding until first version of the Mainnet was done and first Dapp integrated earlier this year.";"";"";
