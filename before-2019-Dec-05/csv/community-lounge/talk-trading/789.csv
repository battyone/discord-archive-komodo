"342751827068059650";"Tek#5253";"20-Jun-19 10:36 PM";"The increased regulation of coins deemed securities (which essentially leads to a ban) may increase demand for coins that are epitomes of *non*-securities such as XMR, LTC, BCH, and DOGE. These coins were (i) fairly started, (ii) fairly mined, (iii) did not perform an ICO/IEO, and (iv) are not backed by a company and are therefore not at risk of being classified as a security. These coins will also remain available to U.S. based investors and are therefore arguably more attractive. For example, Monero is listed on the following U.S. based exchanges:

- Poloniex 
- Kraken
- Bittrex
- Beaxy 
- Huobi US 

And the following U.S. based OTC firms:

- DVchain 
- Cumberland Mining
- Kraken's OTC desk
- Circle's OTC desk
- Galaxy Digital's OTC desk

As well as the following crypto asset brokers: 

- Abra (according to their CEO, Monero will soon be added as a native asset)
- Circle Invest
- Voyager Invest

I think it is fair to say Monero is well positioned to attract U.S. based investors, especially given that they cannot access a lot of other altcoins anymore.

Lastly, it is naive to expect that only the U.S. will increase regulation on coins deemed securities. Each country effectively has security laws that are fairly similar.";"";"";
