I got into it with someone on Reddit a while back saying how KMD has awesome tech and will be revolutionary and how if I only fully understood the project I would know it was the Future (capital F).  Great, I want to believe that since I own some.  But as I expressed my concerns, he let it slip that he only owned $100 worth.  Hah.  Thinking back on that exchange, it doesn't mean anything to me if a grown adult tells me something is going to change the world but he only owns $100 of it (while its on sale!!).  So my question for Siu (and if you wanna get in on this, Hollow), how much KMD do you own?
