What happened in the US was government allowing/encouraging banks to issue loans to anyone and everyone for home purchases.  Then the banks packaged that toxic debt into bullshit debt instruments and resold it in a deceptive way.  So you had 1) a lot of Americans over-extending on their home purchases and 2) institutions and individuals setting themselves up to get rekt by buying the toxic debt.  This is a lot different than a communist government throwing a lot of fiat at crappy housing in an attempt to centrally plan the lives of its tax livestock.";"";"";
