You don't even know what you missed out. I am so fuckin thankful my coworker got me involved in btc back in 2015, i literally owe him everything. My initial goal was ok lets get 1.0, then 10 then..... you get it.

We are at the point of FAST take off. What i mean is it is creeping up daily, but we haven't had a 2k candle yet....we will. it is going to get aggressive fast. 

i truly truly hope most of you out there have 1.0 or much more. for those doubting btc and the direction its headed, i hope you find a way to cope when you look back and think ""man if i only put in $1000 in 2016"".... 

And for you bears, now what? Facebook (in the eyes of normies) legitimized the space. libra is still a shit coin, people will research libra and then instantly find bitcoin. you think they WONT invest in btc after reading about its magical powers?
