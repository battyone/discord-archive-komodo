That is why you see KYC popping up everywhere.  This is going to push more money into DEX's and allow users to really obfuscate their coin trails.  People will use them to trade into privacy coins and then do whatever with those.  It is going to freak them out that they cant control dex's as they see lots of money move into them and away from CEX's";"";"";
