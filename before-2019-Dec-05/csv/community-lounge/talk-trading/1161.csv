Total Coin Supply: 816,000

The SuperNET asset chain is both backed by financial assets that the Komodo team actively manages, and can also produce revenues for asset coin holders. The name SuperNET derives from the former name of the Komodo team; we no longer focus on this name. The following website shows a detailed and real-time analysis of the SuperNET financial holdings: SuperNET Portfolio Analysis

Any revenues generated by assets held in the SuperNET portfolio are distributed to the holders of the SuperNET asset coins. For instance, SuperNET holds a considerable number of DEX. During a payout from dex fees, the appropriate amount of revenue shares that would be transferred into the SuperNET portfolio are instead directly rerouted to the holders of the SuperNET asset coins.";"";"";
