Barterdex has been a central point of the KMD/Supernet ecosystem and a central point of the argument for it's uniqueness, importance and validity, and it remains  on the website as a  key selling point to the technology.  But it doesn't work.  It is essentially unsupported since the electrum servers no longer work with it.  Anyone who hears about Komodo, then goes to the website to check it out, then downloads Barterdex will find it doesn't work and seems like it's no longer supported.  How exactly do you complain about people's FUD when the very thing that trumpeted as making our community and tech exceptional looks like a lie?";"";"";

Why stop supporting it at all with the electrum servers?  It's on coinmarketcap.  There's no reason to discontinue the one that has brand recognition and many many links even if the other one was running full steam.  I've been an investor and a lurker in these forums for about 4 years now, I had a busy 4-5 months with work, came back and found  barterdex non-functional and everyone had switched to a different message site.  I'm a believer and found things not even working.   Imagine you've never heard of this, you follow a link, and everything looks good until that final mile when you try to run the software and....nothing.   If this last mile problem isn't rock solid, it doesn't matter who is hired for marketing, there will be unending bad press.";"";"";
