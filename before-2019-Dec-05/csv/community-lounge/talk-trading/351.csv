While other projects have been laying off or going under, Komodo has been producing more than ever and hiring. If you follow Discord it appears there may be a lot happening early next year; I get the sense that marketing has been gearing up for it. I also personally think the bear market is all but over, or at least will be soon. So IF all I just stated is true, then the current price is a Christmas present. On the other hand, although I want the price to be as low as possible by next week so I can pick up more, I already hold a lot of kmd and it does get a bit disheartening to see the sellers take it down (a double edge sword for me).";"";"";

"219144536771919872";"ver_User#6608";"24-Dec-18 02:57 PM";"looks real good, another positive I believe in being in a coin like KMD instead of other higher market cap more mainstream alts is that there is more ""room to grow"" relative to bitcoin. ETHBTC psychological ceiling is effectively 0.2 region, quite close and basically the upper range that has been established already, beyond that and market cap is now ETH at no.1... Lower probability event. 

Lower market cap coins like KMD with very real utility value and an established base that just needs a wider network of awareness, have still have much greater room to grow relative to bitcoin than the other top tier coins. 

Crypto low may be in, but it may take months of ranging to confirm that, for now a bullish cycle is happening and it's only a matter of time for KMDBTC to make some big moves IMO

ETH may be going crazy for now, but it has a limit, and it's a good influence for other cryptos to follow, when profits cycle out of the eth pump and look for new opportunities";"";"";
