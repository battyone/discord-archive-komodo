That was like a week ago, in my humble opinion you really need to learn to let things go, just let the apathy into your heart. The article isn't mine. I brought it up in a discussion as a possibility/insight. There is no one trick indicator or sure thing in the market, there are just different data points that you can base your decisions on. I never did the math in that article.  How da frack did you even come to that conclusion? I had you on ignore for a while because you were talking down, borderline harassing (not just me, but multiple others in here), feels really icky to talk to you. You come off like you need to be right and you are the one and only truth. It's fine to correct information, I simply would welcome if you weren't showing an attitude of patronizing superiority at the same time. I am pretty sure some people are here to learn, get some help, get some insight, see what the KMD community is like. you are an active poster/chatter here, and you are the one they see when they come in as new players interested in KMD here. I personally get the creeps from you, especially now that I know you are stalking me for over a week and trying to get on up on me. jesus. I am inclined to feel others feel similar about it . I don't understand why or how other people accept that. It's one thing to have criticism or get in some healthy dose of doubt, you don't have to be passive aggressive or condescending about it.";"";"💯 (1)";
