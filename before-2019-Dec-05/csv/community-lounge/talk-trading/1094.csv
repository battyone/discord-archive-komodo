"342751827068059650";"Tek#5253";"27-Aug-19 07:47 PM";"Nothing compares to fantom in crypto currently.

Each dapp a bespoke mainnet net, each requiring FTM to secure and to pay tx fees.

Modular tech stacks at the base of which lays lachesis consensus. Meaning different blockchains can plug their VMs on top and develop dApps.with their own SDKs. Fantom also releasing their own FastVM.

Fully interoperable. Meaning a dapp developped on cosmos use lachesis to pull data from the ethereum chain. Creating the internet of blockchain.

New platform funding concept called ITO which are SEC compliant. These ITO are made to raise funds for decentralized organizations called Workchains. This is released by the guy who invented ICOs. He chose fantom as the platform for this.

Cross chain asset custody. Basically, you'll be able to send BTC under 1 second since FTM transaction can be custodian of.other blockchain assets (securely holding private keys and letting the receiver decrypt the key).

Fantom is working with many social media platforms and online banks in Asia on fantom based payment solutions plus their own called fantom pay.

They have also launched a white label stable coin issuance solution called Statheros which is already being adopted by a company.

Fantom will melt faces and reatrds who still dont get it will commit sudoku.";"";"";
