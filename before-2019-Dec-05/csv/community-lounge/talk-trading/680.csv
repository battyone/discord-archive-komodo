It's 49/51 equihash POW/ pos64 POS with 20% of emissions split between notaries via a pay per notarization mechanism. 

For anyone that doesn't know what it is, it's the first coin to implement KMD's momom scaling tech. This allows us to be ""one coin, many chains"". It allows us to put CCs into production much easier than any single chain could. We can have a separate chain for each CC, meaning a hard fork in 1 CC will not affect any other chain. 

For now, it's all CLI based. Hoping to get it(the main chain) integrated into Agama by the end of the month. We'll have a listing on Barterlly sometime next week and a listing on Zaddex when it launches. 

The purpose of the coin is to incentivize testing of CCs. There is a mechanism in which 1% of weekly emissions can be claimed in bug bounties. You find a bug, make a claim, if >50% of notaries agree this claim is fair, it's paid out. Testing is not it's only usecase. We can implement CCs without hard forking our main chain. This allows anyone to write a CC and get it running on LABS relatively easily. 

Within the next 2 weeks or so, @TonyL will be running a prices CC test on LABS. This is good chance to learn CCs and komodo tech in general and be rewarded via the bounty mechanism. If anyone is interested in diving into blockchain development, LABS is the perfect place to get started üòÉ";"";"shexy (4),üëç (1),üî• (1),üÜí (1)";
