Is anyone else looking to help fund such a effort? We need to get some TRX but if we dont win we will get the TRX back to KMD (so there might be a risk of less or more funds than we started with). I think the exposure of KMD/CHIPS from this even might be worth the 10k we chuck into this. Justin being a serial hype machine and our mate CZ being there too with Charlie Lee. I am sure there would be enough coverage to be worth the effort.
