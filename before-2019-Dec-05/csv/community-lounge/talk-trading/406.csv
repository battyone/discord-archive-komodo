KMD not forcing monetization for things, but providing valuable tech, makes it the center of a growing ecosystem. Maybe some projects convert 1% to KMD or 10% as a conduit. maybe some are 0%, others are 100%. There is no set rules. Lets assume 10% of the overall ecosystem volume goes through KMD, which is probably not off by more than an order of magnitude. So KMD is not needed for anything other than 5% per year, but yet as all these other projects start arising, KMD benefits. It is like when barterDEX was active. it didnt force people to use KMD, yet 80% or so did";"";"🆒 (1)";
