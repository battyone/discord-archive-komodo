I think though we will see a class of stablecoins that does rely on trusted parties but has a clear and common legal structure to deal with issues that arise .   Merchants using blockchains directly for commerce for example,  not in the sense of using crypto to pay for goods, but that the merchants inventory is directly interact-able with customers via atomic swaps.   Basically will be a workaround to not being able to barter physical goods through digital media,  but you can barter titles through digital media.    Consignment would be another example of a stablecoin class.";"";"";
