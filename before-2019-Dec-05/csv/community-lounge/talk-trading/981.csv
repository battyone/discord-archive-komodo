If they are going to dump 20k BTC on bitstamp to get it to 5k, they think that is what will happen, but the market could just bid it all the way back in an hour. So yes that dont hae 100% certainty that things will go the way they have planned, they have a better chance of achieving their goals.";"";"";

It might turn out not to be true if, for example, I was simultaneously attempting to lower it with a few more thoudabd dollars than you.. You don't know how high you would push it with any reasonable accuracy, nor how long it would stay up, nor where it might settle after your operation. You would be guessing all these things and there would be a huge margin for error. You would have no certain path to profit from such an operation. These are my points. Understand yet?

I agree there is ATTEMPTED manipulation in all markets. But the larger the market, the more complex it is, the more number of players there are competing to fleece each other, and the less likely any attempted manipulation can be successful in achieving its goal of profit, unless there is wide ranging collusion of a substantial number of the largest players.  Again, I am parroting settled market theory here. I.do understand that it's just conceptually simpler, and more cinematic, to think that individual minds are pulling all the strings on markets. It's a common misconception of uniformed market observers.";"";"";
