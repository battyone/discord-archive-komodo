 Consistent
with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers
and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of
counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through
an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter
under FinCEN regulations.73
 By contrast, if, when transactions are matched, a trading
platform purchases the CVC from the seller and sells it to the buyer, then the trading
platform is acting as a CVC exchanger, and thus falls within the definition of money
transmitter and its accompanying BSA obligations.7";"";"";
