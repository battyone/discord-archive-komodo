this is live for over a year, it is easily scalable to an arbitrary number of chains (tx/sec or shard equivalents), without the issues that a sharded solution needs.

Just who will explain to people why it is more profitable for them to use kmd for bidding than bnb or btc? ETH has already considered the issue of economic abstraction, but here we have it in its purest form - probably the only thing that has not yet made the last holders to sell is 5% reward! But the same Qtum does the same and the trading volume is 10 times higher! There are many innovations and there is no marketing - except for rare interviews that are watched only by KMD cipher banks and scammers! Initially, we at least had a stake on confidentiality but removed it by transferring it to pirates who might die due to the competition of stronger confidential coins - they simply do not give listing on exchanges and a significant trump card is lost - but it remained with competitors HORIZEN and others! MetalX also agreed with regulators and launch the exchange! What about us? The Komodo project itself, as an exchange and infrastructure, is good and good as a sidechain, but the KMD token itself - what does it do better than the top 10 cryptocurrencies? Without an influx of investment, competitors will eat us up and we will repeat the fate of OBITS - where everything also started well, but in the end the project almost died - although the technologies there are also excellent!
