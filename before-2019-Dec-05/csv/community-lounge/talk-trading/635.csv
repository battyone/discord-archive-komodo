What is komodo cryptocurrency?¬†¬†Well ¬†as its name suggests it's an online currency that allows users and websites to transfer funds between each other. ¬†The only difference is that the funds are not issued by any government but are instead created by the komodo dragon ¬†the giant fish in Japanese mythology that is known for its huge teeth. ¬†In fact that's how the currency works ‚Äì the dragon generates new tokens that become money and if they are all generated and used by the same komodo then komodo coins will be all set to be accepted and backed by the komodo dragon in turn. ¬†The komodo dragon is the only creature that can issue tokens and thus in order to issue komodo coins there must be one and only one dragon that is able to issue them. ¬†This means you can only issue komodo coins to one person ¬†of your choosing. ¬†And all of your komodo coins will be backed by the komodo dragon";"";"üêâ (4),ü¶é (1)";

I understand and appreciate and agree with the idea that whales might be driving this rally.  I know I understand close to nothing and can be wrong about anything (and I probably am!).  But I have been watching charts a lot for many, many months.  This recent BTC parabolic move over the last day/week has really nice consolidation patterns of lower/high higer/low within multiple time frames (4-hour, 1-hour, 15-minute).  This would lead me to believe that if the charts were being ""painted"" by whales that they would be using highly detailed small brushes on the 15 minute intervals to create their masterpiece.

how much will bitcoin be worth in one month from now?

In bitcoin prices we can only compare to the value to the US dollar and the value to Euro since it's hard to compare the two values.

The chart below gives a value to the money in a month.

Source: pricecharts.com

As you can see it's close between US$2,000 ‚Äì US$5,000 according to bitcoin. The difference, if any, between bitcoin and the US dollar and Euro are 0.005 dollars in every month.";"";"";
