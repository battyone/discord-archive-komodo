BTC in many ways is a favorable alternative to legacy banking.  I get it that those people who are very involved and into crypto are more interested in more complicated and nuanced solutions (often to problems that aren't really that common or widespread), but it might behoove you to take a step back and try to see the forest instead of the trees.  One of the biggest problems in our society is arguably that banks have taken control of nearly everything since they print the money.  BTC may be passe or lame to you guys who have come to understand it and then get bored by it over the years, but for lots of people it is still super duper cool.  And for even more people, they haven't even realized it is super duper cool (yet).  The central banks have had us bent over a barrel for over a century at this point, and like it or not, the best tool we have to un-fuck ourselves right now is BTC, not KMD, not ETH, not XMR, not Zcash.  This will certainly change in time, but for the moment, this is just how it is.";"";"treasure (1)";

It is this sort of question that reaffirms that you are so deep in the forest you are only seeing trees.  BTC has been around a decade.  It has never failed.  It has massively more brand recognition than anything else.  Will it be displaced over time?  Yes, but not tomorrow, next month or next year.  Quite possible much longer than that.  The reasons as to ""why not any other coin"" are so long and (seemingly) obvious that I am not sure where to begin";"";"";
