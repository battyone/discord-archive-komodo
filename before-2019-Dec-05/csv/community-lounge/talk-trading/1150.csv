If you look at all the coins that pumped hard during the previous ""altseasons"", not many are left in the top 50 or even top 100 still.  Only a few managed to stay in the top (ETH, XMR, DASH, LTC, etc.) for whatever reason.  Perhaps these coins managed to gain enough followers/investors during the hype.  IMO, KMD kind of already missed the chance to stay in the top.  Next altseason, if it ever happens, will likely be a newer set of coins going up as the market goes through another cycle.  Not sure if KMD will ever see ATH again.";"";"";

But one thing I understand for sure is whichever projects will have continuous delivery on the technological advancements solving the problems in hand right now which needs to be solved to make it adoptable by as efficiently and effortlessly by the masses, will go the long way. It sure won't die or fad away in history. What percentage such projects will keep of the market is also uncertain, but sure even if such projects survive in such long term future, even being in single digit percentage will be enormously valuable with it's total market cap of that future pegged valued asset class or commonly used currency. In all of this game of future value increase, I don't see KMD going anywhere but more valued as time passes by, because it's definitely doesn't look like slowing down in innovating new solutions to current problems and keeping itself ahead in game as compare to any other project in industry. If it keeps doing that again and again repeatedly, as long as possible, it'll gain significant market share. Just don't be jealous or be worried with other competing projects in market with their today's market value. It's fine where they are today. try to help KMD if you believe in it all the ways you think it lacks or need improvement. It sure will surpass others in value too.";"";"👍 (2)";
