I don't understand it either, @hastrup; especially since the wallet that that he's butthurt about isn't even by or involving anyone in this community. From what I gather, there's a loose association between the wallet and 1 or 2 people but it was more that they wanted options for the community than particular ""ties"" to that wallet. Like I said, this is about far more than a mention in a file and *maybe* someday he'll tell us what he's __really__ mad about....";"";"";
