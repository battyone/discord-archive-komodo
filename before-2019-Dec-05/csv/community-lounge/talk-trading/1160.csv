If you buy a cryptocurrency token on very cheap, it doesn't mean you'll be millionaire in future for sure, even if that cryptocurrency goes multiple times the value gradually. the bear markets in between are brutal and you can lose the investment to survive in between.
The ones who plan and build some fundamental rules to keep the financials sorted might survive and will do become millionaire gradually if they keep maintaining their position on their original investment.";"";"";
