it makes a lot of sense, however the problem with basing trading decisions on candlesticks in a choppy market like KMD is you have pinbars everywhere and more often than not they do not signify reversals on the time frame that they should in theory... that daily does look epic, but a retracement that low seems less likely if we are in a BTC bull run for the time being, which he also claims 5-6k being higher probability. 

I'm not gonna lie though, KMDETH is disappointing me, I don't see it going much lower, as in breaking key levels, but chart looks ugly... anyways, in markets ""anything can happen"", so let's see";"";"";

https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

Funds are unlocked as they reach their milestones/prove they have completed set tasks. A crypto bank, a lending platform, a stable coin based on Komodo debt collateral, a venture capital, the ability to use kmd in their project as a native token,  and more. 

Haven‚Äôt been this excited for a project related to Komodo for quite a while or any other coin I‚Äôm in. There are a few (very very low liquidity) coins on the exchange mercatox under GXE. I think it‚Äôs good to do a bit of both, buy a stake of this security token on the exchange at whatever price you can grab as well as contributing to the project by sending funds into their escrowed fundraising/ico wallet. 

I wish them the very best of success. With 100m tokens in circulation, at the ico price of 7 OUR/GXE per KMD, that puts its marketcap at 1,000,000

I‚Äôm sure their kmd based stable coin could be of a lot of use to many of our projects as well";"";"";
