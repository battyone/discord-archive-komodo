My self, with BarterDEX GUI once I got use to flipping pairs, I always did it that way so I was always buying and the price was always the larger number, so I didnt have to deal with huge decimals. But it took weeks of playing around and making mistakes to get used to it. As far as I am aware you are already flipping pairs to always be Alice anyway in hyperDEX so maybe you should just inverse these numbers. 1/x should work fine, thats  the formula I used to flip pairs and never went wrong using it.";"";"";

I am inclined to think that if the 'Requested' and 'Broadcast' entries are so different, maybe the 'Requested' entry (which shows 'incorrect' ) should not be shown at all? Then all you have is the 'Broadcast' and 'Executed' side, and once it is made clear in help/documentation that the 'broadcast' side will be always a bit different from what the user enters into the trade request boxes and why, the whole issue just goes away. 
Same goes for the 'The executed price was 4% cheaper than requested' line. A nice marketing touch, but kinda defeats the purpose if in 50% of the cases it shows an incorrect value üôÇ. 
The related github issues are closed, but I am happy to add my thoughts if <@U8MLQ662K> is making a new one.
