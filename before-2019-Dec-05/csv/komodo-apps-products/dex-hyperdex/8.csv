Btw, HyperDEX has nothing to do with selecting the UTXOs for the sell orders or withdrawals. We just pass the parameters you set to `marketmaker` it and will place an order as close as it can to what you requested based on the UTXOs available. So this is `marketmaker` behaviour, unrelated to the GUI. The same issue will likely occur with the BarterDEX GUI or using the CLI";"";"";
