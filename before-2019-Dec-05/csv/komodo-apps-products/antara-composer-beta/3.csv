- CoinPayments button won't react more than once when spammed.
- Delete warning modal for DEX Articles.
- Using CSS em for everything, setting font-size to anything makes it look correct.
- Did a full test, chain creation and deletion works without any flaw. Definitely needs more testing though
- Fixed some img sizes.
- Safari: Fixed Generator Top Bar was breaking after making the window big and then small again.
- Safari: Fixed @media max-width values were not matching with Javascript window width, breaking the layout.
- Safari: Fixed ( - 2 + ) node count button was broken.
- Using - and + characters instead of collapse and expand imgs for node count incremental input.
- Fixed price was too small in order page for extra small screens.
- Added page loading icon to Chain Details page.
- Email field in Password Reset page is being filled automatically.
- Added Recovery code for 2FA.
- Fixed 'Require Fresh Auth' was not working properly if 2FA was enabled.
