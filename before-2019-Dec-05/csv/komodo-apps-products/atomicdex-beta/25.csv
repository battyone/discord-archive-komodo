Core swap functionality is amazing compared to where things were at with BarterDex MM1 - amazing effort, this is so cool!

I am on iOS iPhone 7 and found the usability tricky from the point of view of keeping the app in focus on the screen and not in the background. Using the app is fine, but waiting for swaps i ran into problems a few times

First few swaps timed out because the screen would lock, and when i bought the app back and accessed via touch ID it didn’t seem to like it much. (so set screen timeout to longer, which meant i got successful swaps but it set at 5 mins which obviously not ideal)

Assume swaps won’t complete whilst the app is in background mode?

Also seems that the touch ID biometric authentication can get it is in a bit of a mess when returning to the app double clicking to bring up the open apps in the background because the touch id message just keeps coming back even though it accepts my thumb and then app goes back into the background.

Other small thing i noticed when i first set up the wallet and hadn’t closed the app yet was when double clicking to get app into focus the screen that was being shown was the first screen with my seed in it! Now i have closed the app and started again and now the screen shown is the PIN screen as i would expect.

Using the actual app and swap function is so easy and simple, so cool, just need to test it on mobile now when walking to the pub for next use case :)

Thanks you everyone in the KMD that built this - its just phenomenal!!!";"";"";
