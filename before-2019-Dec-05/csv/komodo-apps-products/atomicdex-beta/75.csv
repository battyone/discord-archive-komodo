It is pretty much always the case that the initial listings on exchanges, wallets, crypto-services,... do orientate towards the market and likely include some of the top 10 - 20 market-cap coins since these have a huge community and userbase. The services do that in the hope to draw attention to their product since the initial userbase likely has BTC, LTC and other top cap coins.";"";"";
