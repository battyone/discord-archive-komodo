the first goal is to make sure the first 100 users have no problems in the first few hours - there have been a cpl of beta hiccups which are being fixed.
the next beta testers will receive the follow up instructions (so they don't have to go through the same errors of the first 100).  hope you understand it's to allow ppl to process the success/problems without affecting everyone at the same time.

we may have aimed for one subset of beta testers first, maybe by timezone or phone model or some other ""metric"" or randomly.  i'm not aware of the choice, but it's so any minor errors don't affect everyone at once.

the channel has been made public, so everything is done transparently.";"";"";
