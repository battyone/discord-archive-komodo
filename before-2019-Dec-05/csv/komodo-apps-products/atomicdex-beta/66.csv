I see the atomicdex swap happen directly from the wallet.
Let say I Sell LTC for KMD.
The swap is completed but both LTC and KMD transaction broadcasted is unconfirmed.
If a miner decides to create kmd transaction(to his own address), include it in the solved block(nicehash to quickly solve difficulty) but not submit it until the LTC transaction is broadcasted. As soon as that is done he broadcast the solved block. This will allow a double spend to take place?

maybe we need to allow the user to specify the required confirmations for each transaction. using default value so it doesnt have to be changed if it is acceptable. that would allow the user to specify larger confirmations for larger amounts. or we can automatically scale the required confirmations based on the amounts being swapped
probably there can be some algorithm that balances a coins hashrate and economic value of the swap to generate the required confirmations
```
@jl777c MM2 already has the API to set the required confirmations per coin during runtime (not persistent) - https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#set_required_confirmations.

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"18-Sep-19 07:16 AM";"i guess a more practical way is to have 2 confirmation values per coin that we know of and we can manually calculate the > $1000 numconfs, so for small amounts not at risk, it will still be fast, but for anything with significant economic value it uses the slower more secure numconfs. this logic should probably be done by the caller";"";"👌 (2),👍 (2)";
