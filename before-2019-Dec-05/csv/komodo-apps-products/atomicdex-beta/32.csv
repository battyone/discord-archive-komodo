3:14 AM] Mr. Orange: Hello.  I have some feed back on the mobile DEX.  Very good so far.  I have done 11 swaps.  6 Timeout failures.  For some reason, the tactile feedback on entering my pin could be more sensitive.  For the 6 number password, it often only registers 5 numbers. Not sure why, but it happens more often than not.  Also, when a atomic swap fails, it would be better to have the error message stay up until you confirm OK.  Many times I am trying to read the error message but it dissapears before I finish reading it.  Overall, the mobile DEX is impressive and I am excited for Komodo's future.  Keep up the great work. :ok_hand:

I noticed the amount I was selling was very small for the amount of the coin I’d be getting. I thought there must be some mistake, why am I getting such a good rate? I almost didn’t think twice and almost hit the swap button thinking I’d hit the lotto, but then I checked again on the selling amount.
