So if AtomicDex goes crazy and has $1,000,000 of trade volume per day, thats $365,000,000 per year.  0.15% of $365,000,000 is $547,500.  DEX holders receive half of that or $$273,750.  Divide that by 1 million DEX and its about 27 cents return per DEX coin per year.  I'm not sure if that math is right, but thats what I've been thinking about on whether to buy DEX or not";"";"";

Is there some sort of rounding up / down for BTC amounts when creating a new order in atomicDEX, or did I find another bug? at 6 digit amounts for the base coin it rounds way too much and actually down when entering into the orderbook, so if you don't watch out you sell  much cheaper than what you set. 

At 5 digits, it's rounding up 0.002-0.003 BTC depends on what number I enter for the base coin.
At 6 digits it's rounding down 0.0015-0.002! BTC depends on what number I enter for the base coin. (I used 99999 and 555555 amounts for COMMOD, and 0.0077777 for BTC in both cases)
