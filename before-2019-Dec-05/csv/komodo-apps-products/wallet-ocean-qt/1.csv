Unless I've just missed something, Agama lacks :
the ability to send multiple payments at once 
the ability to control fee expenses
any way to manage UTXOs manually
and
any way to even know what UTXOs you have.
Specifically, to the last bit, Agama is like cramming all of your money in your pocket, buying a coffee, and then shoving all of your money at the cashier and saying ""here, you sort it out and give me back whatever change you decide I should have.""";"";"";
