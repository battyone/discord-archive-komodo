They promised we'll be able to look at the new desings in the upcoming months!

I considered it as a  died path of evolution at that time.  Roger Ver and Co. just wanted to grab some money easily, so they created BCH, nothing else.   Currently i have no any BCH accounts with more or less reasonable balance,  so nothing to think about it's fork because  of no chance to earn anything.  I'm not going to buy BCH especially for participation  in this fork. I think that  BCH big holders have exactly this target:  to pump the price on the event's rumor and to sell us their BCH bags. Correspondly, it's a way to losses for us, is not worth to buy.";"";"";

Maybe you've been over there & talked with John Westbrook. @JohnWestbrook ...
He has written Medium articles about VerusCoin & Utrum. And I know he has helped tons of people with technical issues, in the Verus discord, too. So maybe you've met him.

Well, his parents' home was burned down in the California Wildfire, this week. And, his dad is a Vietnam Veteran. Needless to say, they are faced with a difficult situation.  And can use any type of help with contributions at the GoFundMe, that he and his siblings set up, for his parents & their medical expenses. If you are unable to do or just don't really know him, and you have a minute or two--maybe just tweet him & let him know that the KMD Ecosystem cares..  His Twitter handle is @EthAdvisor";"";"";
