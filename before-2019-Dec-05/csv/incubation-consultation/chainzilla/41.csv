1. Because you hope there are many people who want to help they develop their project from the Zilla's team.
2. It will depend on the people interested in what was indicated in the previous point
3. I suppose developing quality projects for clients, thus creating token demand.
4. The referral program is for bringing clients to the project, not for inviting people to invest, although perhaps in the bounty you find something
5. / 6.  You can find that in the litepaper without problem
7.  You can not know, the price that there is in the ICO can be greater than the one that has the token later, if it was known everyone would buy there                                                                                                                         8. Yes, you can sell your tokens in both the hyperdex and digitalprice whenever you want, surely there will be more exchangers in the future
9. Depends what you want to do, if your goal is to trade with the token, you can buy it directly on digitalprice and keep it there without using any application, if you intend to keep it in time you can download Agama, create an address and have them there, you would only have to download the Agama wallet
10.  From own experience it takes approximately 1 minute to have a confirmation, but the time is variable

If your goal is to buy in order to obtain short-term returns, you're wrong where to invest, knowing that the sale of the token will not be until this winter I do not think you'll find buyers well above the price of the ICO.
If I'm wrong about something, feel free to correct me";"";"";
