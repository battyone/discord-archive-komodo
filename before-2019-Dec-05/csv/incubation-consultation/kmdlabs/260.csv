We have a limit of how many notaries we can have.(we should increase from 20 in the future, but this is besides the point)

top n% of top performing notaries keep their position because they're good for the network

we have 1 set of notarizations(LABS->KMD) that is mandatory. If an NN sucks at this, they should no longer be an NN. The emissions of the coin pays for these.

We have many sets of notarizations that are not mandatory. (fungible chains) The chain creator pays for these.

We need a metric for ""top performing notary""

We need to facilitate a market for notarization fees for fungible chains.

If the metric for ""top performing notary"" penalizes a notary for not notarizing a chain, this leads to all notaries being forced to notarize all chains in order to keep their spot. 

It also leads to cheaper and cheaper notarization fees for fungible chains as once a chain starts being notarized, the remaining notaries are forced to notarize it regardless of what the notary fee is";"";"";

See, that's the part I get stuck on
I can't see how you envision a system that puts those that do less on par with those that do more. I agree that the minority can force the majority to do more in order to keep their jobs, but as you pointed out `The chain creator pays for these.` Why would we get paid for not doing what someone is paying us to do while we sit back and watch someone else do it? Isn't it more unfair to penalize the guy doing the work by elevating someone that didn't?
