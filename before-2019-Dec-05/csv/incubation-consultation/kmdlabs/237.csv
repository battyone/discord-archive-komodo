`not sure how well momom will work with blocks days apart`
I have not followed the concept closely, but it would seem to me that it time is a factor then the root are incorrect to begin with, no?
if the branch is provable to come from another branch, why would growth time matter?
If time is a factor, then wouldn't 10 sec blocks and 2 hr block fek it all up?";"";"";
