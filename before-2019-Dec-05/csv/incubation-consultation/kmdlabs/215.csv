we're stress testing migrations, with the scoreboard showing participant rankings.
Migrations are summarised as a json object, and stored in an oracle because why not test that too?
the data stored in the oracles will be validated by @Alright 's script which asks the chain directly.
json data in oracles will be faster for near real-time visualisation purposes";"";"";

The oracle will serve as a log for completed exports and imports. The list of import txid's can be use to do GetRawTransaction which will have info about the export transaction(added  for explorer) if you need to do this... However as long as you dont cheat by placing fake data into your oracle doubt its needed. The verify script bty Alright will verify ppl didnt cheat. It will be easy to seem by looking at totals. 
The export tx should log enough data so that you can take this oracle entry and resume you migrate in case something goes wrong.";"";"";
