I'd like to discuss the possibility of using some of the Dev fund for securing infrastructure for Labs.  To start with, servers.

1440 blocks a day at frequency of 5 gives a maximum of 288 notarizations a day per chain.
1 KMD does maximum of 10,000 notarirzations for each node for 1 chain.
We are at minsig 7 of a max 13,  using an average of minsigs == 10. 
10,000 notarizations takes 34.7 days. 10KMD every 34.7 days per chain. 
365/34.7 = 10.5 
10.5*10 = 105KMD per year per chain. 
Increasing frequency to 10 blocks or using a 2min block time, halves that. 
6000 KMD pays ~300 KMD per year in rewards. 
We need > 6000KMD to pay for notarizations for 3 chains until rewards end. 
Then the 6000 will last another 20 years :joy:```";"";"üî• (1)";
