Also pushing update that disables token migrates to LABS chain in the RPC, and rejects token import in validation on LABS chain, as tokens are disabled on this chain. 
Also getrawtransaction is now fixed with some upstream merges from FSM that I merged in. Will be mergeing paymentsCC down too for the game, so no need for anyone to update now unless you need a specific fix here.
