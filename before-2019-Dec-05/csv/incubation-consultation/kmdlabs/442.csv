re:
```discord just went down for a few minutes along with every single websites protected by CloudFlare it seems. That made me wondering if there is any backup plan to communicate if we loose discord?```

I was also wondering about this after getting locked out of Discord.
Imagine the team would. Not sure about NNs.
One of the things that some of the NN pledges will be used for in #kmdlabs will be hardware.  We'll be able to get a server for the site, Etherpad and I've been thinking of a Matrix server or a similar comms net.
Any suggestions on what would be good for a secure backup network would be appreciated.
If anyone is interested in this area I'd love to hear about it.";"";"";

What this means is that each ccvout can now be signed individually, with the existing wallet code. 
So a TX can have multiple ccvins or ccvouts ,  meaning that simply ccs can work together much easier, along with things nobody has figured out yet. 
A  lot of this stuff came from @miketout  at VRSC., props to him for making it, taken a few weeks to figure out how to use it, but I think I worked out a few things getting it to work that make a lot of problems much easier to solve.";"";"";

1) create a tx to global CC address that is unspendable to create a ""game"" (game could be anything really) 
2) uses the txid of that tx to create a pubkey that nobody has the private key for, this allows other pubkeys to combine with this one to make 1of2 address where tx can be sent and not spent. 
2) We can easily validate  quickly if a pubkey has sent a tx to this 1of2 address , so no other key can send it one, it would just burn the coins and the CC contract would filter it out";"";"";

---- Anyone can register to this game only once with some amount of LABS coin. 
---- The total amount received to this ""game"" is the payout to the winner

Getting there. This is fully using Verus Enhanced CCs Although I changed them a fair bit so they work for komodo CCs better. Verus still lacks ANY validation code in it PBASS so I have no example of how they hope to acheive valdiation so I wrote my own solution. Quite happy how it turned out so far. I think it works even if people mess with things but as usual I need people to try and break it to make sure.

Lucky I created the withdraw object, which can be used to send an extra vout to the game when the first withdraw is made that contains the result, this can be validated on the first withdraw, and then each withdraw after that must send this object back to the game, allowing the next withdraw. This removes the need to look up every single bet tx on disk every time a withdraw is made. I think. ü§û";"";"abusedsmily (1)";
