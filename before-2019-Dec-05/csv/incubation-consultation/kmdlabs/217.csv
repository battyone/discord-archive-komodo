`Do you guys think this incentivized test will be worth while?`
good ideas posted.  Here's my .02:
- stress test not worth 5k KMD. Could be done for free.
- attracting and keeping new people/projects worth a chunk of budget
- use test to promote launch (big test then small launch good?)
- bug hunt, hack-a-thon great ideas! more smaller events rather than one 5k shot?
- `""spam king"" ""points for style"" ""blackest hat"" ""top hype man"" ""the conductor""` attracts more active participation and unanticipated results. very cool.
- `And scripts can be checked on some ""judge"" machince`  how about test Labs bounty scheme?";"";"";
