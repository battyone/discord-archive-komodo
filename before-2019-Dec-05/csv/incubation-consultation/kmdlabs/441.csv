This is my plan yes. But actually implementing it properly is not going to be so easy. 
Basically you can use the seed to generate a game, and all lelvels and items that are possible in this game. This doesnt stop someone not actually playing to game to get the item though. You could just generate games and dump the item stats until you get a game you want with good items then just take the items. Not a fan of having to handle all keystrokes liek rogue did, but it may be the only way to do it.";"";"üëå (1)";

This has taken a while. Finally works lol. 
I made a new way of tracking batontxid, well I think thats what it does. Its for putting large amounts of data spread over many tx's abnd being able to extract them back off chain very quickly.
