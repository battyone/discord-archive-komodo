@Alright  
This branch VHT2... It syncs CFEKPOS51 can you please test it with MGNX? 
Have 100% PoS verushash chain running will leave for a while to see how it goes. We will need to laumch a test chain with PoS/PoW try to get lots of stakers and miners to see how it goes. 
The new changes will only work with chains called LABS and LAB. Other wise ti wont sync CFEK or MGNX.

LABS Main Chain:
    51% PoS 49% PoW - Equihash, same as KMD.
    ac_founders=1440 - Pays notary node multisig address every 24H 33% of the supply split between all nodes, based on notarisation counts. (33% up to discussion, we need notaries to not collude to inflate supply.)
    -- Eventually we need some way of making sure all notary nodes are not too close together. This is a hard problem to solve.
    -- 1 KMD notary node at least to pay for KMD notarisations cost. More than one, each with a single operator is better.
    ---> blackjok3r, Alright, smk762 have all commited to running for election.
    -- Bounty Program:
        Alright: Put bounty info here.
    LABS is fungible with all chains in the LABS cluster. You can send LABS coins to any working LABS chain at any time using MoMoM. 
    
Fungible LABS chains:
    -- 60% PoS 40% PoW - VerusHash with PoS64. 
    -- 0 Block reward apart from transaction fees.
    -- These chains due to their PoS compenent require ~20,000-50,000 LABS to create. (this may need adjustment)
    ---> There must always be a supply of coins being staked on these chains to keep them moving. PoW can be done to unstick a chain if need be.
    ---> Anyone using these chains should be able to stake/CPU mine on them when using it for testing or contracts or whatever needed. 
    -- When a chain stops for X (64?) days, it is considered dead. Any supply left on it is burnt. 
    ---> Notaries must remove the dead chains and a copy of them will be backed up to the LABSMETA chain using the streamer.```";"";"";

    ---> These chains may be short lived or long, if proven stable they can be added as a Fungible chain after being tested (with new supply).
    ---> There is no need to backup these chains unless needed for data collection. Or something cool that happened ;)
