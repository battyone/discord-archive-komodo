The notary network of the LABS (which is different to the Komodo Notary Network) pays bounties at a maximum of 1008 LABS coin per 10080 blocks (approx 7 days).  The bounties can be for any bug hunting and testing to do with any part of the application – cosmetic or mathematical.   Testing is open access for anyone to participate, payments run through automated funds management and voting.  More information to come in coming weeks.```

Fixed CFEKBET1 syncing issue. I think it syncs slower, but at least it syncs every time now. 
Problem is that putting the opreturn validate where it was in check transaction, it could try to validate before the previous block was there and would just fail. 
I moved it to connect Tip so that it always has all information. It seems to sync very fast up until about block 1800 then slows right down. Dont know enough about how it works to know why this is the case. It may just be that people palces bets or something.";"";"👍 (2)";
