Maybe just limiting it so it doent end up with 70,000 utxos will be enough to stop it corrupting. Disableing the rescan on start when its detected there are corrupt txs, doesn't seem a brilliant plan either, as it can try to mine blocks with corrupt txs or something.

I think I could copy paste the whole RPC and make a new one that returns just amounts per segid, but you have no idea what is actually being staked, so I dont think its  useful enough for me to spend my time on it. Unless someone wants this specifically.";"";"";

It counts back from the chaintip the number of blocks you speicfy, checks if the block was PoS, and extracts the segid of that address that staked it. 
This is a much neater and faster way of my staking strategy. Waiting on Alrights python staking scripts, to use as an example to intergrate this in. 
try running it on LAMEDUCKS 🤣 
`komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKLAMEDUCKS getlastsegidstakes`
segid 5 and 7 have 3000-3500 stakes each, the rest ~200... I guess someone is staking to -pubkey on segid 5 and 7.";"";"👍 (2)";
