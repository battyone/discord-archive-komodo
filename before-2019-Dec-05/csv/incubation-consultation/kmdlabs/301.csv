Please update iguana and inatall tor on your nodes. Its ok if a few of you dont right away., Just please DM me if you updated so I can track how it affects counts. 
``` Install TOR:
 sudo apt-get install tor
 
 Check its working:
 curl --socks5 localhost:9050 --socks5-hostname localhost:9050 -s https://check.torproject.org/ | cat | grep -m 1 Congratulations | xargs
 
 Create rule in firewall to route iguana traffic through tor:
 sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 9997 -j REDIRECT --to-port 9050```
its working on my node, and was fairly easy to do. Don't think any of you will have any issues.
To update it should be a simple `./start.sh` It should build and restart iguana for you.";"";"";
