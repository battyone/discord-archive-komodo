Like insane fast, most vps providers are good enough, but a home connection or a small data centre like where my sever is, can have very low counts... Especially because we are not enforcing regions, there will likely end up a small group of nodes who are all very close together that will dominate counts... I've said this would be an issue fro. the start, and alright just said to move node to where it preforms better...

PoS ... it calculates if it can win, if it cant then it does not try... as time passes, the calculation becomes easier, until a utxo can stake and tries.
