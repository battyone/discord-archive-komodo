You cannot do that with the current code, It doesnt matter if your node  has a 1Gb wallet.dat or a 100kb wallet.dat. Or if it has 1 utxo or 1000. It caches the first 50 in the daemon, and gives iguana one at a time. If you are submitting spent utxos, your node cannot enter recvmask. The latest updates to the daemon and iguana, should stop that happening, unless my fix didnt fix it :abusedsmily:";"";"✌ (1)";
