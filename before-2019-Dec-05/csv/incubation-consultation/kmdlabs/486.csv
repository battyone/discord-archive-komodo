While taking a few minutes to recover from a rough week at work I'd like to tell you a story that relates to you.

It shows some of the character of the people here and makes me even more proud of what we've got and what we are doing.

For the last 6 weeks I've been out and about, meeting many other projects and people involved with blockchain and crypto.  The amount of lame 'tech' and blatant scams I've seen is quite eye opening. 

Certainly some naivety on my part.  That's what working with people like you, who are busting their asses to create real and valuable things, has done to me.  I was thinking that what we are doing here is normal.  It's not.

This experience has had me thinking a lot.

There is great demand in big-business for what we already have, not to mention what is well along in development. Some very smart people find it hard to believe that what we are doing could be possible.  They only dream of having things that we have already had in production for months and months.

Komodo, and what we work on here in KMDLabs, is building towards something big.  And it's thanks to people like you that it will get there.

Very glad to be here.";"";"KMD (5),labs (6)";
