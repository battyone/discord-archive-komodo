We have some new chains added. CFEKPAY for the paymentsCC game, and LABSRCTEST which is another clone of the LABS main chain. STAKED4 airdrop has happened, and I beleive there is a chain oracle with the details of the airdrop saved into it. I am staking LABSRCTEST, can others please do that also?
If we could get a couple of GPUs or ASICS on this chain just for a few days that would be quite helpful, as this is the last test before launch! 
Yes its happening! We are actually starting the LABS chain 8-9 months after STAKED/POSTEST came into existance. Its been a long road, thanks to all who have helped along the way. 

For the Payments CC Game, I will be giving away 10,000LABS coin on the main chain at launch, to the person who wins the game. This is plenty to stake with and early on and could turn into quite a lot of LABS, if staked well. There may also be a KMD prize although this is yet to be decided. 

I noticed some minor issues with building the latest master. If it refuses to build. the process that got it working for me was the following:
AFTER running `./zcutil/build.sh`
1) enter `~/komodo `or `~/staked/StakedModo`
2) `make clean`
3) `cd src`
4) `rm libcc.so`
5) `cd cc`
6) `./makerogue`
7) `cd ../..` 
8) `make -j8`";"";"üî• (2)";
