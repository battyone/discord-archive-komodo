"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 02:44 PM";"what use case do you imagine for this @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 02:46 PM";"Heh, still figuring that out. Picture it kind of like arcade tokens for gaming. You migrate in to play, but there's no cashing out like poker chips.";"";"";

"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 02:48 PM";"Its barely an idea yet, and quite possibly pointless but curious if it could be done";"";"";

"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 02:54 PM";"yes that would make sense for things like rogue";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 02:54 PM";"but it is just burning coins basically";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 02:54 PM";"would make sense if the arcade is walking away with the cash 游땥";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:02 PM";"well, value is on the ""value chain"", so they are effectively burnt as soon as they migrate into the games room. They offer use for whatever gaming purpose, but cant be redeemed to the value chain.
So basically if the value chain creator does a greedy pre-mine, they can charge entry to the games room.";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:04 PM";"still not convinced its not a stupid idea tho";"";"";

"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:05 PM";"it is a good idea, but I don't see why it should just be a money hole";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:05 PM";"the coins could do something useful";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:05 PM";"I'm not a fan of burning coins for it basically";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:06 PM";"it does sound like it could work well though";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:07 PM";"which ones? The value chain's use is standard, either trade for kmd/fiat or buy fun tokens. Once you buy fun tokens, you can only play.";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:08 PM";"not sure I understand";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:08 PM";"the more popular games are, the less value coins in supply = greater value";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:08 PM";"are you burning coins to receive fun coins or just buying them from the chain creator?";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:10 PM";"both? still bubbling this thought. chain creator could monopolise, though it seems greedy. But yeah, as soon as you buy fun coins, they exit the value supply";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:10 PM";"dont put too much thought into it, I havent done that myself yet 游땏";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:11 PM";"I was thinking how we might do a labs rogue chain, but I'm not sure how we would fund the coinbase txs to the CC address";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:13 PM";"hmmm I just had an interesting idea, no idea if it would be practical to implement";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:13 PM";"basically like when I first played with dice, tokens were basically locked into the contract unless you won it back. Something like this could mean whoever setup the gaming table could get paid for what goes onto the table before it goes onto the table.";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:13 PM";"but what if LABS chain could have emissions, but the fungibility rate with the main chain is based on coins transferred to it/ coins emitted";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:13 PM";"does that make sense?";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:14 PM";"the longer you keep your coins on a chain with high emission, the less you can export back to main chain";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:14 PM";"user that wins at table gets to play more, but thats about it";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:14 PM";"means games have to be worth playing, not just for the hope of a jackpot";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:15 PM";"maybe, less heat from regulatory jackboots?";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:17 PM";"yeah to emmision thing is similar (or the inverse) to my half formed thoughts. basically  as fun tokens are purchased, supply goes down. So exchange value goes up in terms of fun token exchange rate";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:19 PM";"for example let's say a fungible chain is created with 1 LABS per block. After 1000 blocks, the emission of this chain is 1000 LABS. If 10000 LABS are transferred to this chain, the most that can be exported back to mainchain is 10000. This means that exporting 1000 of this chain back to the main chain would result in ~909 coins coming back to the main chain";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:20 PM";"so (total coins transferred / total coins on chain) would be the fungibility rate";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:21 PM";"I guess it's not ""fungible"" at that point";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:21 PM";"interesting economic experiment anyways";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:22 PM";"basically, if a chain requires a block reward, you pay for it if you hold coins on this chain";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:25 PM";"it this like negative interest rates? Promoting spending, not saving";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:25 PM";"not sure what you mean";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:26 PM";"if you see a chain with a high block reward and it's not worth transferring coins to it to use, don't.";"";"";
"448777271701143562";"smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640";"21-Feb-19 03:26 PM";"disincentivise holding, incetivise gameplay.";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:26 PM";"but it would enable something like rogue to work which requires emissions";"";"";

"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:28 PM";"you would definitely not want to hold coins on one of these chains";"";"";
"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"21-Feb-19 03:28 PM";"you're basically directly competing with other people holding coins on it for the emissions";"";"";
