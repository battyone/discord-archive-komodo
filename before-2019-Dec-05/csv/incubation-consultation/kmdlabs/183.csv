@CrisF @blackjok3r so you want to know total supply of a given chain in a cluster.   i'll take this as a sample to create a stats web service.

how long does `coinsupply` take to return on kmd main chain?  i've been waiting a few minutes.     doing it on main chain with 5 blocks or 50 blocks is instant.  50000 blockheight takes a few fractions of a second...";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"03-Jan-19 02:34 AM";"So knowing the ins and outs of everything before you ttry to make anything is kind of required... its not a great idea to trial and error these things.";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"03-Jan-19 02:34 AM";"just use `gettxoutsetinfo`";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"03-Jan-19 02:34 AM";"I worte all that on the pad already";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"03-Jan-19 02:34 AM";"how to do that";"";"";

"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"03-Jan-19 02:35 AM";"so do like `coinsupply 50000` then once that is finished `coinsupply 100000` then `coinsupply 150000` ....";"";"";
"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"03-Jan-19 02:35 AM";"oh well, lets see if it affects notarizations!";"";"";

"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"03-Jan-19 02:45 AM";"OK so, what we will do here. We should keep CFEK... It will no longer be a cluster, it can be oracles chain. Its already full of oracles so we may as well leave it as that.. It will be a good test to try and speed those up some more, they can still be slow on validation. 
There will be 2 new chains cluster 105, just and only for testing migrates. To make sure this new hardforking change is stable, and the new `getimport` rpc works. These two can also be used to create the stats gathering scripts for the oracle project of @CrisF 's . I will need to leave here for a fair while soon, so hopefully we get it started, and enough people have updated by the time I get home and we cna get testing. üòÉ";"";"üëç (1)";

"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"03-Jan-19 03:07 AM";"so with your coinsupply across different chains, that's going to be handy to put into an oracle, and have multi-sig signing ??  otherwise, you trust one node to write the coinsupply data?";"";"";
