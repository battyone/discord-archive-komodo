When user reports failed migrate they only need supply the JSON that is saved to the failed file, to notaries, who then start the script with the path to the file as argument 1, and it will run thoguh the entire process, if it cannot manage to import the burn on the target then  notaries know that it failed and the backup validation can be used instead. 
We will need to test this backup validation. Hopeing to get an actual fail, but we dont need a fail to test the backup import.";"";"";

Just had to take a larger range, it seems that on KMD,  if 2 notarizations are inside the same block and then the 3rd one is in a very close block to it, that its still missign stuf.. 
So I increased it to 7 range back, and rewrote the migrate script, so that it generates a whole range of transactions... idea being is that if the 1st one fails, each notarization that is made  will have so many hashes included going back, that eventually a matching hash must be seen.
