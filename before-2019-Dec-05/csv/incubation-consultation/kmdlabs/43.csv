From there I will use c code to fread the the file into 8kb chunks of hex ( its actually a bit less than that) add a seq number then scan forward to the next chuck read it and send. I can probably get bandwidth though this chain of 400-500kb a second. Depending on CPU power, something like my ryzen 2700x might be even faster then that and I will test it don't worry ;)

So for a life streaming it should be a mediaserver on one side  which generating HLS output from input (stream on input or screen capture) - let's say 10 chunks (1.ts, 2.ts and so on, each chunk is 10 seconds by HLS standart recommendations) + manifest where declared playback sequency:
```
1.ts
2.ts
...
10.ts```
Then you have to continue publish chunks to oracle and refreshed manifest (with same name) depends of time elapsed. Let's say on next publishing it will be 
```
5.ts
6.ts
....
15.ts```
This manifest should be available by link/path for VLC like a http://sever/manifest.m3u8

I have a tool based on TxBlaster API, which will read a file and seek though it taking 8KB at a time then sending. For the very first test I was using a huge hex string hardcoded inot marketmaker, and just sending the same data every time, I tried to randomly generate it but ran into pointer issues with C strings and gave up. 

We will then need a function or RPC in komodod for ac_streamer=1 chains that gathers this data and writes it out to a file i the same order it was sent, as it wont always arrive in order exactly, james suggeston of having the sequence number, then the previous txid, then fill the rest of the op_return with what fits, seems like a good ideo.";"";"";
