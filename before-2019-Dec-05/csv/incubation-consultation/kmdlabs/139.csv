The background images and placement of the logos on them are for reference only.

Logo variations boil down to this:

2.  Black/white flask, black/white text

So I repeat here what was covered there as this channel is exactly on topic.  I have a ""shovel ready"" real world project which I need help to materialize.  I am looking for help in putting together GUI templates something like the www.swagger.io demo where a non-technical person can write an API on that webpage for their organization.  I want  a tool that will interface the RPC where the user can ""fill in the blanks"" to create his own Oracle CC to put IoT and other data on the blockchain.  As I am sure you are aware, only the Komodo ecosystem tech is able to meet the tx/sec required by IoT data bursts coming in from millions of devices.   I want to begin testing the Oracle CC ASAP under ""real world"" conditions.  Since I am not too technical as yet, I  need help from the community.  I do have  detailed knowledge of what the workings of the apps should cover -- so we can avoid ""theoretical silos"",  coding the exact requirements of the end users.  The KMD documentation says, ""A data publisher needs to register a datafee and their pubkey for a specific oracletxid"".  We need to design a smart phone app that will register and pay the fee and upload its edge signals to the Oracle CC.    Googlemaps API is one data source we can register or use leaflet like  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator did with his interesting CC to track his dog.    It seems like we have all or almost all of the components now to put together what this real world application needs.";"";"";
"461335333339004933";"axo777#1232";"03-Dec-18 02:43 AM";"Once we get it running it has the promise of being a big boost for Komodo and its ecosystem as well as the team members, directly or indirectly.  This must be ultra ""user"" friendly with GUI's that will make the blockchain simple for non-technical people. User group members will be restricted to invitation only with just a few entities on the low end to hundreds or thousands of members on the higher end.  With the advent of Sapling and the possibility of developing ZKP signals for IoT devices in the future no other commercial ""blockchain"" such as Hyperledger Fabric or Sawtooth will be able to compete with us if we are the first mover.  We need to strike while the iron is hot in this important sector.  I look forward to comments from the community about this ""shovel ready"" project.";"";"üëç (1)";

I am looking at the global market where any number of devices will be able to operate in the system.  Seems like making universal registration code that will accept signals from any device is needed.";"";"";
