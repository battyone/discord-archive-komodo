The updated version has a lot of changes and an improved UI to make it more user friendly. This version changes how you create new wallet in Lite or Native mode and the way you use Lite mode vs Native mode.

Direct login using seed or WIF key is no longer supported. You will need to use restore wallet feature first with existing seed or WIF.
Concurrent usage of native and lite mode coins is deprecated. From now on you can either run Lite mode coins or Native mode coins during one session.
Your coins selection is automatically stored when you add or remove coins.
Native mode coins can be started without creating an Agama wallet. Just add them using the login screen.
Following security best practices you must write down your seed in a safe place while creating a new account. Do NOT take screenshot or picture of your seed on a machine that is connected to internet.
We have updated guides on how to use the new lite mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024492-create-new-wallet-and-encrypt-seed-spv-
