However, the article doesn't talk about the counter to them which is our 'delayed proof fo work'. dPOW gives an independent chain the security of Bitcoin's hashrate by on its chain.

1. You ought to look at how big Bitcoin's hashrate is compared to everything else (which is why it makes an independent chain secure) https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-btc-eth-bch-ltc.html 

2. You could read The Merkle's article ""Can Delayed Proof-of-Work Effectively Counter 51% Attacks?"" - https://nulltx.com/can-delayed-proof-of-work-effectively-counter-51-attacks/.

3. You could share the news about projects like GameCredits adopting #dPOW in response to attacks https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?u=eae7d500e24dcdb21b359fccf&id=22eccdf457.

Help us reach out to CoinDesk and ask them to include 'delayed proof of work' in an update or response to this article. Or help us boost these posts on social media..

This new version release changelog:

* Fixed settings save bug that got socket timeout param broken
* Updated asset explorers to point to *.kmdexplorer.io
* ZILLA coin added.
* Fixes the recent SPV connectivity issues

Direct Links:
Linux: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-installer.zip
macOS: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-osx-installer.zip

Linux Portable: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-portable.zip

After installing the new version, if you are still facing connectivity issues in lite mode, make sure to delete the local userdata stored by previous versions of Agama before following the SPV connectivity issues guide on confluence.

This can be done by reset settings from settings. If resetting does not work, please remove the `config.json` file manually.

Data to be deleted: 
Please don't delete the whole `Agama` data directory as the dir contains your encrypted seeds
* Ubuntu: Delete `~/.agama/config.json 
* MacOS: Delete `config.json` file from ~/Library/Application\ Support/Agama dir
* Windows: Delete `config.json` file from C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Agama\ dir

When you change an entry in the `Settings` and save it, for it to take effect: 

* Click `Complete Logout` from the Top Menu
* Close Agama
* Open Agama again and login with your required Coins.

Now the previously saved settings will be effective.";"";"‚úÖ (4),Komodo (8)";

- Ask questions here on this channel
