I'd very much like to talk with you about viewkeys when you have a some time. If appropriate Id like to publish a small article on the subject. Im not looking for a bounty on this one but will solicit the community for tips. From what i gather this is a major tech breathru that you managed without Zcash's help. To clarify this point and other details re the significance of viewkeys please let me know if youre interested in discussing this either here, or via DM.  Thanks","",""
