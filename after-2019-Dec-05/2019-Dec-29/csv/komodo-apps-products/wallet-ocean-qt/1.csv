this is expected. It might stay like that for more than a day depending on your connection speed and location
you could use a bootstrap if you don't want to wait","",""

if the ""Activating best chain"" screen doesn't go away in another 20 minutes, my suggestion is to delete the blockchain data and use a bootstrap
