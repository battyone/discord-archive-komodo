[28-Dec-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Oh B Graviex has HUSH/BTC and HUSH/KMD pairs

[28-Dec-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH/KMD doesn't see much volume, but it's very useful üôÇ

[28-Dec-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> here's the atomicdex books (search for HUSH) https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Blockfolio says no trade volume in graviex for hush in a few days

[28-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Dec-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Thoughts?

[28-Dec-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> he is right

[28-Dec-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> to tell ppl privacy coins are more then privacy coins is wrong

[28-Dec-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> if you search for adoption, privacy coins will have a hard time in the future

[28-Dec-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> so if you ask "Is a privacy coin as curreny valuable in the future?"

[28-Dec-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> it depends on the use case

[28-Dec-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> for p2p, Blackmarket maybe

[28-Dec-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but privacy coins are for privacy! Nothing else

[28-Dec-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Like Hush do: Act and Speak Free

[28-Dec-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> that can a privacy coin provide. Is that valueable?

[28-Dec-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> For me YES

[28-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but can you in future pay with any privacy coin in the Amazon store? Of course not. And it is not Smart to do it, even if you can

[28-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Cause a privacy coin is for privacy!

[28-Dec-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> so he compares "Apples with pears" if he ask it like that

[28-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> agreed

[28-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is why HUSH is focused on Zcash Protocol *as a technology for communication* not purely for financial transactions

[28-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Yes, that is what makes Hush unique

[28-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> No Marketing about "we are the currency of the future!"

[28-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is not meant to be a store-of-value, it's meant to be a medium-of-communication

[28-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> cause its a lie

[28-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we also happen to hide all communications in the metadata of a financial transaction! Devious! üôÇ

[28-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is very important and why XMR-based memo competitors, are severely not as private

[28-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When you use the `extra` field in XMR, the whole world knows how much data you put in, they can see, and they know which xtns use it and which don't

[28-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In Zcash Protocol, every single xtn has 512 bytes of encrypted memo, no matter what. If you use it or not. So nobody can tell which xtns are financial and which are communications!

[28-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is critical, and for instance, LOKI does not have that

[28-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> LOKI uses masternodes to pass around your specially encrypted message, and that stands out like crazy

[28-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And not to poke fun of LOKI, this is in the deep XMR protocol. All cryptonote-based coins have this problem

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> </rant>

[28-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Dec-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> needs some tweaks, but it's mostly done. Hush doesn't fuck around, we are vying to have the best privacy of any ZEC protocol coin, or go down tryin'

[28-Dec-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> these metrics will help us study our own privacy, and compare it to other coins like ARRR+ARW
