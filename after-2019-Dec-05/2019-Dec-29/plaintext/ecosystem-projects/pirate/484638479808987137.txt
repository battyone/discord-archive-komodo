[dscrd-prt] <𝕲𝖎𝖌𝖆𝖒𝖊𝖘𝖍 𝖙𝖍𝖊 𝕻𝖔𝖜𝖉𝖊𝖗 𝕸𝖔𝖓𝖐𝖊𝖞> @Pirate Queen Jane hi Jane, hope you are well. I'd very much like to talk with you about viewkeys when you have a some time. If appropriate Id like to publish a small article on the subject. Im not looking for a bounty on this one but will solicit the community for tips. From what i gather this is a major tech breathru that you managed without Zcash's help. To clarify this point and other details re the significance of viewkeys please let me know if youre interested in discussing this either here, or via DM.  Thanks

[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Wendy is probably one of the most -authentic- influencers in crypto and my hope was that this would help put pirate in a very positive light.

[dscrd-prt] <allbits> I'd love to be trying out ghostship OS but I'm not able to get to a bootable USB. I'm definitely a noob, but I have successfully created tails USB and live ubuntu recently. Not sure what I'm doing wrong with this one

[28-Dec-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <allbits> Can't do as video says - don't have Windows and that's a Windows only program, right?

[28-Dec-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <allbits> I used unetbootin - unsuccessfully apparently

[28-Dec-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Dec-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Dec-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @allbits How about this. If you and @wieprz1999 can work together to figure it out (if he has time), and write up how you did it, I'll give you each 500 ARRR

[28-Dec-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Dec-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <allbits> For tails, I used ubuntu startup disk creator. But that app does not recognize the ghostship ISO. So I tried unetbootin, which appears to have created a bootable USB. But it doesn't boot. That's where I am.
