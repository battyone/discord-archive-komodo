[telegram] <troyswood> TECH question - When claiming rewards through KomodoOcean QT, which # is used, the Available or the Total? ...thanks

[28-Dec-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <troyswood> This is confusing, as when the "Use available balance" button is clicked, it's not the Total balance, so it is excluding the rewards, which I'm trying to claim. ...very confusing

[28-Dec-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <troyswood> DISREGARD - I found out, it's the "available" balance

[telegram] <Regnar> Two little pics of an all HTML/CSS wallet that runs the Komodo nSPV wallet

[28-Dec-19 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If anyone here is good at HTML/CSS and wants to mess around with some blockchain stuff, there's probably some pretty cool wallets you could build using this, without having to touch any Javascript or getting into backend code at all.
