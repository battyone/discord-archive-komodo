[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
i've got some thoughts on the design of the decentralized order matching. to a degree this is about design philosophy, so if this seems like an off-topic or too much in the air, feel free to ignore it

what is decentralized software? we might say it is a network of actors talking with each other. if they can't talk to each other or can't understand each other then this is no longer interesting to us because such system is not functional. if they can talk to each other, and do something as a...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
not sure how using an existing blockchains p2p network to propagate orders (locally generating orderbooks) fits into the above.

my simulations show that with a constant heartbeat ping to the peers (about 16) every few seconds, an order broadcast into any node can reach all nodes in a bit over the heartbeat time, with the bandwidth used being about twice packet size of the order being broadcast, times the number of nodes in the network. with optimizations this can be reduced to just a bit m...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] Issue opened: #575 nSPV via caretakers
the subject of this issue is using [nSPV](https://komodoplatform.com/advancing-nspv-technology/) from a mobile phone

for now i'd like to simply clarify some high level assumptions, insofar they might influence the general decentralized design. also to raise awareness of this use case and to gather bits of information as they occur

@jl777, in the light of splitting the network into peers and caretakers (#373), with peers being severely limited in how they can communicate with the network...

it fits rather well as a caretaker network implementation, IMHO, if we replace orders with extensible generic entities

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
just having data blobs that are interpreted by whatever higher level layer would actually be the simplest to implement into the p2p protocol. it would just serve to quickly propagate these blobs to all nodes.

it would then be up to the higher level caller of this service to use the data properly. an rpc call that returns the most recent N blobs would allow incremental processing of just the newly arrived

if this would be useful, i can look into making a modified daemon with this data bl...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
Yes, this looks very useful!

We *also* need to improve the way the (mobile) peers access the blockchains eventually, so I wonder if basing this peer to peer network on top of the nSPV peer to peer network (#575) is a good way to solve both?

[KomodoPlatform/developer-docs] Pull request opened: #144 update enable method: manual importaddress
Per the discord question here: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/449950331577565194/659292649437528114

In contrast with mm1.0, mm2.0 does not automatically import the address in the coin's daemon, when MM2.0 is used in native mode.
The docs should include this information.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
the p2p network would automatically support nSPV fullnodes, which means the p2p network automatically can get nSPV support. that would allow doing a libnspv level interface and get access to the DEX rpc calls.

it seems the confusion is that you are thinking there is a separate nSPV p2p network, it is really the same p2p network as for the coin itself, fullnodes support it by default. so it seems to be a matter to add several nSPV api calls to submit a datablob, find datablob, get update of...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #570: Payload too big in http\_fallback
This error is back. Same involved IPs. It starts to show up as soon as a swap starts and does not stop till i restart the node.
