How can a kmd smart chain be made so that any services on the network, be paid to the miners?  Like how Verus Id payments work?

Inputs go to coinbase vout?

Is this possible now, or will some kind of “payment routing” be possible?</span>

<strong>confronting with false accusations</strong>

It seems that you have probably skimmed the text very fast, had false impressions and have reached the wrong conclusions. 
You keep repeating things that I didn&#39;t say or think.

I do have criticism but it is different from the words that you put into my mouth.
It just forces me to write a text wall to confront all the false accusations.


So don&#39;t distort or put words into my mouth because if only we could get rid of all these straw man attacks it would be much better. 
I have no hidden agenda, and you&#39;re making it a lose-lose instead of win-win.


<strong>setting the tone for the discussion</strong>

I don&#39;t wish to have a high tones discussion and I didn&#39;t come to fight nor I have fighting spirit nor wish for.
Nor wish for an emotional convo or anything like that, just a clear, rational and friendly discussion. 
And different point of views is also ok. I have no problem with that.
I&#39;m just trying to understand if for me, it is a good investment. 
And if I&#39;m missing something big, it&#39;s even better, because I&#39;m sure that 99% of the other people out there will be missing it too, 
meaning that the market is not taking it into account atm, meaning that when it is realized, 
the end result is much higher ROI. That’s all. And if a better understanding/improvement 
(because it seems that you&#39;re sure that you already have all the right answers) are made, 
this is also good, because the market also didn&#39;t take them into account. 
And I write a lot here in the discord because of the simple fact that 
I find this tech very interesting. So, don&#39;t take it personal or anything like that,</span>

                </div>

            <div class="chatlog__message " data-message-id="660627892224655381" id="message-660627892224655381">
                <div class="chatlog__content">
                    <span class="markdown">this is really not my intention. Maybe you will even be able to convince me, you have done it many times before...


So for a start, lets first set things straight, just so we can be on the same page and can get back later to the real criticism...

And give me some time to write and reply, because this is not my native language (Even fixing my spelling mistakes take me a lot of time).
I cannot compete with the speed of your writings. 



<strong>get things off the table</strong>

Ok.

Let&#39;s first get all this stuff off the table.

1. No one said low level stuff is easy. 
   It could be made easier and that&#39;s what CC does. but BTC consensus is never going to be easy.
   It is hard, slow and this is no new news. On the contrary, you&#39;re saying exactly what I say..., it&#39;s not easy, it&#39;s difficult. 
   And yes, hardcore programmers, should be experienced devs and that&#39;s what they do (i used to be one of them).


2. In addition, no one suggests to write drivers with some fancy language. 
   There is also agreement on this part.


3. &quot;this imaginary goal of getting coders who don’t want to learn the bitcoin protocol, 
   to be able to make CC, is wrong. there are many who understand bitcoin protocol and C/C++&quot; - of course. 
   Why would anyone do it? It&#39;s definitely not my goal anyway...


4. &quot;<span class="mention" title="richardt#2807">@richardt</span> yes, of course and we dont lack depth in the tech stack so artik 
   theory that KMD is a failure without allowing CC to be created by less experienced devs, it is flawed&quot; 
   - not true. This is not what I think or wrote. You can cite me if you wish.


5. &quot;to have inexperienced weekend coders be able to create a CC in a weekend is not realistic&quot; - 
   I&#39;m saying that a contract should be made within a weekend, not CC.
   the reason that you say what you say is because all you have in mind are CC&#39;s... 
   I have different things in mind, which I will explain later.


And please stop talking about inexperienced dev. You keep repeating it.</span>

                </div>



            </div>
            <div class="chatlog__message " data-message-id="660627926961618985" id="message-660627926961618985">
                <div class="chatlog__content">
                    <span class="markdown">I&#39;m talking about Avg dev and you keep pushing.

I&#39;m sorry to say but it just seems that all the things you have wrote, 
is because you have just read it in hasty way or they are all just one big straw man attack.



The thing is, that no matter what I think now or you think, the future is going to come anyway. 
So, in a 10 years’ time period, we will have all the answers.




<strong>my real argument</strong>


Finally, I can get to the main argument.

What I&#39;m saying is different...


<em>I&#39;m not necessarily suggesting that there is something wrong with the tech stack.
I&#39;m suggesting that there is something missing.</em>


Just to have the full argument, so that maybe if other people didn&#39;t read it before. 
I will probably repeat some of the things that I have already said.



<em><strong>current approach and the problems with current approach</strong></em>


<strong>dev gap</strong>

On the one hand you speak about how easy FSM CC is, and that 
it will allow creation of a new &quot;contract&quot; without coding, 
basically, from a json description and you&#39;re suggesting that invoking these cc (&quot;contracts&quot;) 
from a json with different configurable parameters.

And on the other hand, you have the utxo cc that are too difficult for avg dev.
because over a year of development and maybe we only have 2-3 devs know how to write these utxo CC and it speaks for itself. 

(If it was easy there would be 50 devs doing them, and you wouldn&#39;t have to pay them to do it, 
they could just do it for fun. I hope we can finally agree on that.
just to make it clear. yes, the CC made consensus code a lot easier, but it is still hard.
And I will repeat once again, no one suggests that an inexperience dev would do it, and you know what? not even avg dev.
are we ok with this definition?)

The thing is, that I see a huge gap. 

On the one hand, no coding json stuff... on the other hand too complex bitcoin CC code.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">so the majority of devs are left outside. 

It is just a simple Gauss distribution. the majority of devs wish to write simple code, 
not architecture and design, neither working with json. And you&#39;re missing out on all of them in this community, 
and if they can&#39;t find it here they will find it elsewhere. It&#39;s very simple. (some  have already started looking elsewhere)  



<strong>budget</strong>

You talk about budget limit and the what-if scenario of 100/1000 devs.
Yes. Budget is extremely important, but these are not the cards you have being dealt with... it&#39;s just the simple reality. 
The game is played and won with the cards one has. 
With the funds you have right now, you should be thinking of how to do more with less.
not with the imaginary 100s millions that others have.

(btw, Cosmos raised ~$17m. today it is valued maybe 4 times that amount (not to mention their stake in the currency).
PolkaDot raised a really huge sum but a most of them were freeze due to a bug and they plan to unfreeze it or possibly raise more.
So they both do have a lot of funds).            

btw. the whole budget thing, is just a feedback loop with the market.
if he thinks that you&#39;re executing on something big, he will give you more funds.

<strong>dapp vs driver</strong>


If I get you right, you try to &quot;catch&quot; all possible use cases by using existing CC&#39;s and by tweaking existing CC&#39;s
and you hope to have bigger budget so you can make as much as possible of them, and cover many more use cases.

You speak about 100/1000 devs, so I guess that this is how you eventually try to catch all the &quot;spectrum of use cases&quot;. Right?

I don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s going to work.
Are you going decide/dictate which CC is needed and then someone is going to develop it?
this would be very inefficient, because if you think about something, it doesn&#39;t mean that anyone needs it... 
the market knows better than any single person in the world what is needed and what doesn&#39;t.</span>

do you really think that anyone would use the heir-cc in the next 5 years? maybe you can manage get one person in the world to do so...

A second option is much better. meaning that if a company needs CC they will hire someone to develop it. --&gt; there is a need.

Now. Are you going to develop chess-cc, checkers-cc, mahjong-cc... etc.?
the biggest question for me is: Is chess-cc just a tweaking of checkers-cc?
If it is, that is interesting. If it doesn&#39;t, you&#39;re definitely fighting a losing battle.

at the end of the day, CC&#39;s has just one purpose. setting a new state. Do we agree?
And all this bunch of logic/code lines/state machine has one purpose. --&gt; set new state.
And the question that is asked is, where this logic that leads to setting a new state has to &quot;sit&quot;. and how much of it.
you suggest that all of it. And here we may differ.

if a contract is needed ETH dapp dev, will put it on account on the chain, 
(to be processed by EVM when there is an invoke command) and call it a dapp.
and you will have a generic form of it, put it in consensus 
(one is account based and the other one is utxo based with all it&#39;s benefits. ok) and call it CC. Right?

What prevents someone from developing a dapp that is also a template 
(similar to one that you do in CC) and can also be tweaked and configured, 
but in a much more convenient/fast way than a CC? but at the end of the day, in fact, 
you would both have the same logic. one puts it in one place and the other in another place.

why do you think that Sudoku-cc is a driver, it&#39;s not a driver, it&#39;s a dapp.
Driver is on you, dapp is on others. There are zillions of different ideas.

but the thing is that you think you should hire 100/1000 devs because you think of it as a driver and not as a dapp...</span>

<strong>slow and heavy, fast and dumb - my own examples</strong>            

This project reminds me something. 
I had a lot of experience in domain names and even wrote a book about that. 
later I have spent 7 years, half of it was 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. building a domain names analysis tool. 

my plan was to find all the possible general use cases to where a domain gained value from.
i.e. suffix (.com, .fr, etc.), spelling, one/two generic words etc., 
if it has a trademark or cyber squatting issues, short - rarity, transliteration value and many others.
It was a slow and heavy development. I was building under the hood a huge huge engine. 10 times better than anything they could dream of. 
the plan was to cover all possible variations of domains by cataloging them to a few dozen classes.
give each one a weight in each class, and by that have all the spectrum of all (limitless) possible domain variations. 
then when a new domain estimation arrives, it would be compared to domains that have the same characteristics as he has.

Others just came by storm, doing something very simple, running dumb, fast and wild and got the market. 
I didn&#39;t have the resources (got financially broke) to continue and just abandoned the project.

Same thing happened when I have worked for a startup that developed a wap protocol suite 
(an efficient way for cellular phones to have internet voice and data, replacing the tcp/ip stack, 
because bandwidth was very limited at the time) we were working on bare metal, hard real-time low level stuff, 
and Phone.com were moving fast with some fancy higher level stuff, and were valued many times as much as we did.</span>

<strong>it is not scalable, inside devs vs outside devs. (and regardless, it&#39;s the wrong approach)</strong>

Current approach doesn&#39;t scale.

Of course, if you had more budget you would have more CC developers but this is the wrong way.
It&#39;s just looks like that you insist to include the whole world into a slow/difficult development consensus code.
Does sudoku-cc really fits only to consensus? Heir-cc?
         
When you think in terms of scale, you think about hiring more inside developers...
When I think about scale, I think about outside developers (leverage), 
and when you have the right setup, they can easily outnumber the inside developers.
In an orders if magnitude difference, no matter how much devs you could possibly hire.

How many hotels does the biggest hotel/room service (AirBnb) in the world has? None.
they didn&#39;t try to buy more rooms and rent them... if they did, it wouldn&#39;t scale. they let others do it for them.
think about the rooms as dapps and the visitors as users. They are just a platform to enable others.

How many taxis does the biggest taxi service (Uber) in the world has? Again... None.
think about the cabs as dapps and the passengers as users. Again, they just have the right setup to enable others.

And the list goes on... Craiglist doesn&#39;t have more than 50 employees.

Microsoft made a couple apps for themselves (Office, internet explorer, media player). But that’s about it. 
Komodo (AtomicDex... and possibly few others)




<em><strong>the meaning/power of a true platform</strong></em>

<strong>the meaning of a true platform</strong>

A true platform is open and inclusive.


<strong>having the right setup</strong>

If your goal is to pay 1000 CC coders - this is not a platform.</span>

No need for 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 komodo core devs.

The job is to have the setup and not to develop the contract. The contract others non-paid should make.
There are thousands of people coming to eth conferences are not paid by eth.

Better with less. Instagram was sold for $1b while only having 13 employees. that&#39;s an archetype of a true platform.

Just pin the setup right. If you get it right, you have done your job.                         




<em><strong>proposed solution</strong></em>

<strong>account abstraction layer + VM</strong>

There is a need for an account abstraction layer that translates the UTXO-based model to an account-based interface for a VM (EVM or other).
Similar to what QTUM does. I really don&#39;t see potential for mass adoption without it.

Maybe we can take some QTUM code and do some plumbing stuff here or maybe you would be able to come up with something better.

One option, like account-cc as Mylo suggested, could even help writing consensus code. easier CC coding. it could not hurt anyone. 
other CC&#39;s could even use it.

But the main issue is account abstraction layer.                        
Account based contracts are already an industry standard. 

dapp devs don&#39;t need to know the deep internal stuff. It is better to shield it from them.
It is much more intuitive for devs, that, combined with the benefit of the underlying security of utxo.
Not to mention tapping into the ecosystem around account base smart contracts.(development of tools, migration etc.)

What do we have to lose? 
A little bit competition is not going to hurt anyone. 
And besides multiple options is always good. 



<strong>middleware</strong>

Let’s take the Linux example.

OpenOffice was not written with bash scripts...
in software development there are layers... low level, middleware, high level.

I find it hard to believe that some json is going to replace real coding.
you have low level CC, high level json and you&#39;re missing out on the middleware.
middleware would create a more complete/complementary system and is also fulfilling devs wishes.



<em><strong>benefits of the new solution</strong></em>                

<strong>leverage</strong>

<strong>ETH ecosystem leverage (tools, thousands of devs - no migration) + devs leverage</strong>

with EVM for example, devs are happy because they can write code, 
ecosystem is happy because we could leverage the hard work of hundreds or thousands of ETH dapp devs 
and instantly have these dapp here (and maybe even miners are happy). 
the system is account based (industry standard) so any other dapp from any other ecosystem could be migrated very easily.
this community cannot compete with the amount of devs that ETH have, 
and it also creates a leverage on komodo devs, so that they could take ETH dapps (or other platforms dapps) 
and just tweak them if they want, to fit the komodo ecosystem needs. it&#39;s a huge leverage.

there is no need to develop sdk&#39;s and tools because ETH ecosystem does it for you, 
same for windows environment tools. it is much more inclusive and accessible.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">and if we are un-happy with EVM we could easily replace it for other VM. ETH can&#39;t, they are stuck with it.

Just to remind you that we already have scale and ETH doesn&#39;t...

it&#39;s a unique value proposal --&gt; scale, EVM dapps, and possibly adding hard real-time stuff to lower costs 
if one decides that he wishes to have his own dapp as an ASIC (CC).



<strong>unique value proposition (FPGA vs ASIC, scaling + EVM) the benefit of having both</strong>                     

If someone wants to have it as CC, fine. If he decides to do it on a VM, also fine.

if the entry barrier is low enough, usually dapp devs won&#39;t have the resources to hire a CC dev from the get-go.
many of the ETH devs don&#39;t have the resources for that. they just have their coding skills, 
and if their dapp is catching up, then they could hire a CC dev. this is the right order.
(instead of first hiring an expensive CC dev, waiting weeks for it to compelete, just to later see that there is no demand for their dapp...)
he could bootstrap his dapp, for free, with his own simple skill and his own idea and later if the dapp is succesful, 
and he is happy he could go deep and have a cheap ASIC (CC), 
and go down to the bare metal and he get an additional benefits
and make a cheaper version/save costs he could hire a low level CC dev (Lower level stuff is slow development) that would do it for him.
nothing prevents that. Think of that as FPGA and ASIC.

it&#39;s an additional benefit that this platform can enable and others cannot.</span>

you try to make the whole world an ASIC, but some of the world is really not meant to be an ASIC. Actually most of it isn&#39;t.

My intuition also tells me that maybe some better as CC and others as dapps.
atm everything is forced as CC...

Maybe things that we don&#39;t expect will happen... 
Maybe a developer decides to have some parts of the code inside a VM and another inside a CC.

So this system doesn&#39;t have to be Linux or Windows. It could have the benefit of both worlds.                 

Both layers should compete. Give them the option to choose... and let the best one win.

my bet is that in a short period of time, the VM layer, will have x10 or x100 amount of code in comparison to the CC layer.
My second bet is that each one (CC and VM dapps)is useful in a different way.
My third bet is that account layer + VM would not even compete with CC, they will complement each other. 




<strong>inverse</strong>

think about this ecosystem as a funnel.
on one side it should be open for <em>everyone</em>. every high-school kid in computer science class wishing to experiment.
some of these experiments would have success, and could take it more serious, 
go down the funnel and hire someone to develop their own CC with it&#39;s benefits.
atm efforts are being made just in the inverse. trying to open up the wrong end of the funnel (CC).

I&#39;m not necessarily saying that the CC that has been developed by now are wrong.
they are powerful demonstration of the tech, but having too much emphasis on it and going further down this route is not fruitful.

if kmd wants to develop more tech and use the CC, sure go ahead. 
but wishing to have 100/1000 devs to develop more of them is a big mistake.</span>

                    <span class="markdown">having few different use cases and examples is good, but in general case, they should be develop only when there is demand.
we should off-load this stuff to other people.



<strong>smart chains benefits (EVM + hard fork?)</strong>

Account abstraction layer integrated with VM has many benefits.
Maybe by that we can have dynamic loading of contracts to a chain without a need for a fork/updating komodod deamon/codebase. 
It is much more flexible.

In addition, komodo smart chains could have their optional VM of choice (Tezos VM, EVM etc.)



<strong>the fancy stuff (acknowledgement of pros)</strong>

And here you have to at least have some acknowledgement of the pros (of course it has also cons, 
but lets speak for a moment about the pros) of the so called &quot;fancy stuff&quot;.                    
        


<strong>time to market</strong>

In a competitive environment there is a real meaning for term &quot;time to market&quot; (sometimes it is much more important than anything else).
so the things you call &quot;fancy stuff&quot; are rapid development that cannot be matched, 
certainly not by CC or any other consensus code.  
it could be fast prototyping PoC, minimum viable product, or full blown product.



<strong>price sensitivity</strong>

Some dapps will probably won&#39;t be so price sensitive.
And in any case, think about a chain the has VM (EVM or other) and can run in parallel (so there is never going to be bloat) 
and has only one single killer dapp. it still going to be quite cheap. 
not as cheap as if all the code was in the consensus (of course...) but still cheap enough.</span>

think about heir-cc. 
Do you really think that someone that put his life savings in a contract really cares about an additional fee of 2 cents gas/fee?        



<strong>take from others but use your own lock-in (utxo CC)</strong>

Maybe the utxo contracts can be viewed as a good and bad type of lock-in.

There are good and bad aspects to it.

Utxo, beside of being slow to code, time consuming to develop and need deeper understanding of low level stuff.

Good:
Other projects will have very hard time to migrate the utxo contracts here into their account 
based project (basically they would have to write it from scratch). 
But if we have in addition also account based contracts, it would be very easy to migrate their dapps into this ecosystem.

Bad:
utxo devs are always going to be expensive and hard to find. 
just like web devs vs real-time devs. 99% of the jobs are going to be account based. 
there won&#39;t be too many utxo jobs but there also won&#39;t be too many people suitable for this job, so it balances out.</span>
