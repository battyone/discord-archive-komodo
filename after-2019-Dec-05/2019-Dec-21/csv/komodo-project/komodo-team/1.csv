Monero doesn't have something similar
while there is this proposal <https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf> for a monero-btc swap, it is vastly different from atomicDEX's protocol
while it is doubtful if we will support Monero in the near future, we might work on it at a later date","",""
