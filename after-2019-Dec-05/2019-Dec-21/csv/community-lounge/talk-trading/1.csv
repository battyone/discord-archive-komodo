And I had nothing to go in anymore and I start to cry (because Lack of Liquidity) .... At 0,3$ / kmd... I would wish I Could have $ to go more All in...

I don't think we will see 5$/kmd anytime soon ^^. Need a job to invest extra money at those 0.5$/kmd it's a great opportunity. 0.3 or 0.4 would be even better.","",""

Every crypto was very overvalued during the 2017 spike and might still be. Buying 1 KMD (or any other utility crypto token) gives you the right to use service Y on the KMD chain at moment X. What is the fair value of that at the moment? What use do you get for 50 cents? There is nothing wrong with investing now by the way (or even back then when KMD was prices at $7), if you can spare the money. First of all you support the project by HODLING (in theory it keeps price higher if less supply is available for sale), second you get to use the KMD chain at a moment of your choosing in the future when the fair value of using the chain might be way higher than $0,50 and third you can buy them as a high volatile and high risk investment to sell for a higher amount in the future.","",""
