[telegram] <joshuamayu44> Is Kmd going to offer a stable coin?

[telegram] <joshuamayu44> I think a .05% transaction fee would be ideal

[telegram] <Pari_1362> Are there any fans of art? You know that blockchain has already improved all the industries, but I wonder if there are any solutions for this field. I think that art sphere must be transparent, especially the information about the certain piece of art, it‚Äôs history, dates, centuries, owners, and so on. There are so many fake art pieces. I know that Tilcoin solves these problems, like Fresco, Veristart. But I enjoyed the first one more as it has its own ecosystem and token with benefits like compensations, participation in art events, as well as the high-quality precision.

[telegram] <Acura360> Final reminder everyone. We are 483 blocks, ~8.5h away from the Network upgrade. This is a mandatory platform upgrade, so all miners, exchanges, and individuals running full-seed nodes must update to the latest software before block 1670000. Those who do not update will not run on the correct network.

[20-Dec-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> What does it mean for the ordinary KMD holder

[20-Dec-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Shouldn‚Äôt affect anything for regular user,  if running a full node make sure that software is updated and not on a fork when activation height hits

[20-Dec-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
