Below 50 cents is a good buy. At 30 cents or below, I'm going all in. üòÇ

[20-Dec-19 07:20 AM] Evitor#6985
At 1,5$ / kmd it Was a great buy, so I went in. By 1$ / kmd it Was a better buy and I went all in. At 0,5$ / kmd. It Wasn't possible... And I had nothing to go in anymore and I start to cry (because Lack of Liquidity) .... At 0,3$ / kmd... I would wish I Could have $ to go more All in... And continue to cry (because Lack of Liquidity).

But I am very happy for evry New Investors for this cheap oportunity! Wow, they have so much luck!

[20-Dec-19 09:41 AM] BlockTech#6895
@Evitor feel you buddy üò¢  Got in at 7$/KMD, average down to 3$/kmd, not enough money to average it down again ... I don't think we will see 5$/kmd anytime soon ^^. Need a job to invest extra money at those 0.5$/kmd it's a great opportunity. 0.3 or 0.4 would be even better.

if btc holds the 200wma as normal the future is bright

[20-Dec-19 10:35 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
if not all bets are off

[20-Dec-19 10:36 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
guess we will find out in a couple of months

[20-Dec-19 10:43 AM] CoinKing88#1540
To be honest KMD at 7 dollar was way too high at that point if you look at value for money (besides pure price speculation). Every crypto was very overvalued during the 2017 spike and might still be. Buying 1 KMD (or any other utility crypto token) gives you the right to use service Y on the KMD chain at moment X. What is the fair value of that at the moment? What use do you get for 50 cents? There is nothing wrong with investing now by the way (or even back then when KMD was prices at $7), if you can spare the money. First of all you support the project by HODLING (in theory it keeps price higher if less supply is available for sale), second you get to use the KMD chain at a moment of your choosing in the future when the fair value of using the chain might be way higher than $0,50 and third you can buy them as a high volatile and high risk investment to sell for a higher amount in the future.

[20-Dec-19 10:44 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
no ne bought kmd to use the chain üòÇ

[20-Dec-19 10:45 AM] CoinKing88#1540
If you compare KMD (tech now, tech in the near future, commitment team) with other projects that are priced way higher (absolute and total market cap) KMD might be a bargain now if price speculation is your thing.

[20-Dec-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
KMD is an incredibly cheap way to piggy back on dpow to BTC

[20-Dec-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
I understand that's not a typical user use case, but it's certainly unique

[20-Dec-19 10:49 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Agreed, but what is other projects stopping them to start using that too if this turns out to be a USP? Is it hard in a technical sense to achieve that?

[20-Dec-19 10:51 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Don't get me wrong by the way guys, the fact that i am in this channel confirms my commitment as a user to KMD (i would love to do more than just lurking here, coding is not my expertise). I just like to be sceptical and rational as it comes to value etc.

[20-Dec-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
It's possible to do it yourself, but most projects opt for managed dpow service from KMD NNs

[20-Dec-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
to do it yourself, can look at LABS. It does exactly this

[20-Dec-19 10:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
That would be very nice to achieve, like small vendors that use Amazon to sell their product through a powerful and big webshop

[20-Dec-19 11:39 AM] richardt#2807
Too bad a lot of coin projects don't care too much for dpow, even the ones that keep getting 51% attacked (VTC)

[20-Dec-19 11:48 AM] richardt#2807
@BlockTech I'm sorry to hear that. But use it as a lesson. When everyone in the chats and on Twitter is saying it's cheap and a good buy, it's likely not. Notice how Twitter is relatively very quiet these days... almost no one tells you to buy when they're silently accumulating.

[20-Dec-19 01:28 PM] CoinKing88#1540
A lesson indeed to not go semi all-in at 1 or 2 price levels, don't be too greedy

[20-Dec-19 01:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Heard about a dutch guy that put his whole savings account into Vechain near the top, that didn't go well either

[20-Dec-19 01:33 PM] Markus#5464
Or learn to do TA and u have significantly higher chance of finding possible bottoms or atleast somewhat better entries

[20-Dec-19 01:49 PM] Markus#5464
My advice would be to learn and master fibonacci, it will make make ur life way easier

[20-Dec-19 03:48 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Who can tell me how Supernet works and how a coin itself holds various other coins (supernet holds a big chunk of KMD). So if i would hold supernet tokens i would indirectly hold kmd as well? Dont understand thtat

[20-Dec-19 03:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes that is the case

[20-Dec-19 03:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
By owning supernet you are a holder of the assets it holds so currently something like 14kmd per supernet

[20-Dec-19 03:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Plus all the other coins

[20-Dec-19 03:55 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So its more like a equity fund, a basket of crypto tokens? Owning 1 Supernet makes you owner of 1/777777th of everything SuperNet owns (which makes the value of Supernet)

[20-Dec-19 03:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
Excatly its a fund

[20-Dec-19 03:56 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So Supernet gives you a piece of a underlying address managed by JL777?

[20-Dec-19 03:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes

[20-Dec-19 03:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
He is like a fundmanager

[20-Dec-19 03:57 PM] CoinKing88#1540
If for example the KMD is sold for dollars, those dollars will flow where?

[20-Dec-19 03:59 PM] CHMEX#0686
I can imagine if that happens there will be a dollar assetchain like in the very early days of the pegged Fiat chains

[20-Dec-19 04:01 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Allright, so the total funds managed by Supernet are now 8.6 million (Supernet NAV on website dexstats.info). Getting 1/777777 would be rougly 11 dollars right now of underlying value.

[20-Dec-19 04:02 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Or adjusted to 15 dollar because Supernet holds 198K supernet coins of itself too to make it even more complicated üòÑ

[20-Dec-19 04:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
üòÄ also supernet holds assets which hold supernet I think

[20-Dec-19 04:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
But yes I think you got the pictures how it works

[20-Dec-19 04:04 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Wish i was around when this all started, my bags would be filled because i see all this potential but prices are allready quite high. Owning like 1000 Supernet is just too expensive for me

[20-Dec-19 04:05 PM] ffffffff (kremer)#0658
it was so risky back then

[20-Dec-19 04:05 PM] ffffffff (kremer)#0658
in the nxt days

[20-Dec-19 04:05 PM] CoinKing88#1540
But then you would not have payed 15 dollars per supernet i imagine

[20-Dec-19 04:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
1000 supernet is also a pretty big chunk of the supply after all its a very rare coin

[20-Dec-19 04:07 PM] CHMEX#0686
Not risky was during the nxt to sn migration days buy low on nxt sell high on barterdex keep the profits in supernet

[20-Dec-19 04:15 PM] richardt#2807
I thought NXT had a lot of potential. Until they went and screwed it all up

[20-Dec-19 04:16 PM] richardt#2807
They had devs like jl777 building on the platform. And then had to go and piss him off üòÑ

acquiring supernet was my focus since 2015. there was a nice firesale when poloniex delisted it.

[20-Dec-19 06:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
been hodling for so long now that I'm not sure I'd ever sell them.

NXT AE had dividend producing assets that actually did payouts every month. It was a very exciting time. feel's like ancient history now.

i remember NXT AE. i was using it with FOMO always :abused:

[20-Dec-19 08:55 PM] crumb#2550
that sucker was notoriously unstable tho. especially during the DEX, SuperNET etc migration time. most of the time it was just not working for me... i remember that stress as if it was yesterday :abusedsmily:

[20-Dec-19 09:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
By that time nxt was pretty much dead

[20-Dec-19 09:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
When it was an active platform never had any issues
