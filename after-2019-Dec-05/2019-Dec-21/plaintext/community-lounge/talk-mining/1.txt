[20-Dec-19 02:44 PM] CoinKing88#1540

[20-Dec-19 02:47 PM] Alright#0419

[20-Dec-19 02:47 PM] CoinKing88#1540
What is the current market price aprox. for supernet today?

[20-Dec-19 02:48 PM] Alright#0419

8.7 million per supernet?

`What is the current market price aprox. for supernet today?`
10000 block rewards would = ~ 15-30 KMD in trade (depending on the market)

[20-Dec-19 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
forgot about this ü§£

[20-Dec-19 02:52 PM] Alright#0419
