AtomicDEX is compatible with monero?

[20-Dec-19 08:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@jin1988 atomicDEX uses HTLCs on utxo chains and smart contracts on ETH and other compatible smart contract chains
Monero doesn't have something similar
while there is this proposal <https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf> for a monero-btc swap, it is vastly different from atomicDEX's protocol
while it is doubtful if we will support Monero in the near future, we might work on it at a later date

[20-Dec-19 08:34 AM] jin1988#3498
What you mean is , it is possible monero can merge into atomicDEX?

[20-Dec-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically possible. realistically will require monero devs to do the monero specific parts

[20-Dec-19 08:59 AM] jin1988#3498
understand, thanks

[20-Dec-19 09:00 AM] jin1988#3498
Are there any person to do it?

[20-Dec-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810

fluffypony left the team (unsure if the reporting is accurate though)

[20-Dec-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810

[20-Dec-19 10:11 AM] mrlynch#5735

[20-Dec-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
