Having just signed up for the @KomodoPlatform weekly newsletter, I receive this awesome digest of information that is too good not to share! I hope you find it as useful as I did.

Dear Citex team,

We want to remind that Komodo v0.5.0 (Obsidian Dragon) update goes live (activates) on December 20, at block 1,670,000 (approximately in 48 hours).

It's highly recommended to suspend KMD deposit/withdrawal operations between December 19th - 21st.

it is a precaution, just in case the hardupdate doesnt go smoothly. we are expecting it to go smoothly, but if the exchange wallets are closed, then even if it isnt smooth there wont be a way for people to take advantage of it

[20-Dec-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
height 1,670,000 is in about 900 blocks, as long as we get past it without any issues, then all is happy

[20-Dec-19 08:57 AM] laura#6637
Thank you, I will pass it over to our dev

@KomodoPlatform it's kind of weird that you list 5 other coins that use Equihash but forgot $HUSH, which predates 4 of those 5 coins https://t.co/nqX0HtjT81
