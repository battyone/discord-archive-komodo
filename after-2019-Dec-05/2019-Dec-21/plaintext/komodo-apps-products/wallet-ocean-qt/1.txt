don't post full debug.log here, could have address info in it you wouldn't want to share

if he can't start wallet and it shutdowns in some reasons right after start, debug.log will not contain any addresses info.

[20-Dec-19 04:43 PM] erav3n#9290
only reason why it shutdowns.

[20-Dec-19 04:43 PM] erav3n#9290
but yes, you are right. there is non-zero possibility of containing something personal, like addresses or ip address info in debug.log.
