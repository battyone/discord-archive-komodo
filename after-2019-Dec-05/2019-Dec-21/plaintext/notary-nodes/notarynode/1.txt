@NutellaLicka can you PR it to the main NN repo?

If you'd like me to, but where? This isn't my proposal for the next election. It was merely my way of holding myself accountable for the  promises I made during the election. Giving my voters peace of mind and information about how my NN is going.

(Should be up to date with main NN repo)
Thanks for your post, @NutellaLicka.  Your site has given me some ideas that I can add (when time permits, haha).

@NutellaLicka I created NN's repo with exactly this in mind, not just proposals. Keeping connection to your voters in a single source. You have your own folder
