[telegram] <Mixic> When the update happened, some nodes that may have not been updated or configured properly broke off into their own fork and were followed by poor nodes that happened to be connected to them and followed. 
In the process, these nodes created a persistent fork that started getting banned by the nodes on the main network, and some people may now have difficulty getting back to the main network if they have been banned. 
We would ask anyone running a full node to use the command 
./verus clearbanned
, once to enable other peer nodes to have a second chance. We are doing this for nodes we control. 
We suggest that if you notice you are not on the block height of the main explorer:
https://explorer.veruscoin.io/, you are probably on a fork. 
Please save your wallet, clear your data directory, and replace it with the bootstrap available at:
 https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC.html or start without and sync the long way (will take a long time to sync). 
More detailed instructions on the process can be found here:

As a precaution, we have also advised all services and Exchanges to pause the deposits and withdrawals from Dec. 19th - 21st, 2019.
This is a mandatory platform upgrade, so all miners, exchanges, and individuals running full-seed nodes must update to the latest software before block 1670000. Those who do not update before December 20 will not run on the correct network.
All ecosystem Smart Chains (asset chains) will upgrade on Friday, December 20, 2019 11:06:40 AM UTC (timestamp: 1576840000)
