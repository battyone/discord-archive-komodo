Hashed Timelock Contracts
Hashed TimeLock Contract or HTLC is a class of payments that use hashlocks and timelocks to require that the receiver of a payment either acknowledge receiving the payment prior to a deadline by generating cryptographic proof of payment or forfeit the ability to claim the pay...

```RPC error response: lp_ordermatch:852] sender pubkey 028b2e2d4a963657a1ba52b0c22410edb96fb0bad188e561766a8732843cb5d531 is banned```

do we have specifics on when pubkeys are banned?

@jorian 
As of now no, it can be retrieved by checking the swap history and searching the swap with the banned pubkey. However it's not so straight-forward. I think I will add a bit more info along with `unban` method implementation requested by `cipi`: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/571#issuecomment-562535247

how about the rules for banning? will you add it to the info?

[16-Dec-19 01:44 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The rules are actually very simple now, if swap is failed with event that is typically considered as other node fault it's pubkey will be banned until restart:
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/lp_swap/maker_swap.rs#L823
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/lp_swap/taker_swap.rs#L332
Of course we will add more conditions and implement the feature rich reputation system, but the current workaround is sufficient to stop the node from always matching with bad maker having the best price.
