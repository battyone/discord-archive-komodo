Topic: This channel is for discussion and announcements surrounding the oracles crypto condition contract. Please feel free to answer any questions, technical or non-technical. The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.
