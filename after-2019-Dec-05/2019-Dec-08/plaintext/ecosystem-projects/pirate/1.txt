[dscrd-prt] <rrrj288> I just downloaded the lite wallet and received some coins in there. when coins came in, another new address has been automatically generated with 0 balance and there now 2 different addresses shown on the interface. Why did this happen?  I didn't generate any new address.

[dscrd-prt] <rrrj288> I don't have issue sending or receiving coins, but just curious where does the new address come from

[dscrd-prt] <Louis> Good evening, tried to pm one of the Pirate core team devs but I know they are busy so thought best to ask in hear. My question is: “Today I opened up an old Pirate Ocean wallet and found some pirate coins under a zc address. Can I still covert to zs address, and how can I contact "CHMEX#0686 " for the coversation please? “

[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> what is the plan for the future (not only for pirate, but all chains) when there's so much data that it takes 1 week to download all the chain info to run a full node?

[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Internet and storage should scale to where it isn't an issue
