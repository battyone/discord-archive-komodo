Gotcha. So wallet.dat and keys will all remain? Just git clone and compile

[07-Dec-19 01:04 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Thanks for the help üôè

[07-Dec-19 01:04 AM] Oszy#5734
yep

[07-Dec-19 10:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
fatal: destination path 'komodo' already exists and is not an empty directory.

[07-Dec-19 10:44 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Do I have to delete whole komodo folder beforehand?

[07-Dec-19 10:51 AM] gcharang#6833
@Crabby Paddy were you doing `git clone`?

[07-Dec-19 10:57 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
yeah

[07-Dec-19 10:57 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
instructions above

[07-Dec-19 10:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
git clone https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
#This can take some time.

cd komodo, git pull, then build work?

[07-Dec-19 11:00 AM] gcharang#6833
it is better to remove the komodo directory and follow the exact instructions from above

[07-Dec-19 11:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
rm -r komodo

[07-Dec-19 11:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
then run the above?

[07-Dec-19 11:00 AM] gcharang#6833
> cd komodo, git pull, then build work?
some times build may fail when doing this, and may need to be repeated

[07-Dec-19 11:00 AM] gcharang#6833
yes
```
rm -rf komodo
```

[07-Dec-19 11:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Okay will update how it goes üôè  Thanks for the help

[07-Dec-19 11:02 AM] gcharang#6833
np!

[07-Dec-19 11:03 AM] gcharang#6833
also, be careful when doing `rm -rf komodo`
if you add a dot before komodo, it could delete your wallet.dat and blockchain data as well
