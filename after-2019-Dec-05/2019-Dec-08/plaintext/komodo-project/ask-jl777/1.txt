I'm not sure you're following me... "whatever any collateral gained value, bank will sell everything at a stupid price to get their money."  - if you have money (saving account as collateral) and it gained value but you didn't have the money to repay the loan what happens? They liquidate it (for the sum of the loan plus interest plus fines whatever) and send you the rest... it's very simple

[07-Dec-19 12:06 AM] phm87#7395
I don't think that there is interest here, just a kind of fee at liquidation as I read.

[07-Dec-19 12:07 AM] artik123#2884
The interest is irrelevant... I'm talking about the principle

[07-Dec-19 12:09 AM] phm87#7395
but if KMDEUR is increasing, I think that you can have more keur, jl said it somewhere, I'm searching for the message

[07-Dec-19 12:09 AM] artik123#2884
Yes, but you could never redeem the loan

[07-Dec-19 12:10 AM] phm87#7395
you can redeem the loan if you find another way to have some value (euro or KEUR) to do it

[07-Dec-19 12:11 AM] phm87#7395
I also read that partial redeem will be possible (not sure if it is possible in this release)

[07-Dec-19 12:11 AM] artik123#2884
I was specifically talking about the case where you don't have other resources. Please read the discussion

[07-Dec-19 12:12 AM] phm87#7395
I'm reading but similar subjects were also discussed elsewhere

[07-Dec-19 12:19 AM] phm87#7395
for me, jl replied to your question here https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/652553834777935872
But when you say ``They liquidate it (for the sum of the loan plus interest plus fines whatever) and send you the rest... it's very simple`` I think that jl777 said it is possible here
https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/652561082023542813

[07-Dec-19 12:22 AM] artik123#2884
Yes. It's true and it's going to be done. But later I wrote a couple of things to sum up my thoughts and the discussion continued with Mylo

[07-Dec-19 12:26 AM] phm87#7395
about ``Without a "closing account" option, it could possibly lead to a systemic problem where, over time, more and more loans would never be redeemed and an ever-increasing amount of usdk will be floating around. I'm not sure what the consequences of it will be`` I don't know how to print more KEUR than total existing existing cryptos. We have loads of USDT floating, it still works. In worst case, 100% of KMD (and other cryptos) will be locked in loans. I don't think that we will reach this point

[07-Dec-19 12:28 AM] artik123#2884
We won't. I just mentioned a possible systemic problem. Btw, in worst case 80% will be locked :)

[07-Dec-19 12:28 AM] phm87#7395
yeah i know but we can change that in the code

[07-Dec-19 12:28 AM] phm87#7395
that's why I wrote in worst case

[07-Dec-19 12:30 AM] artik123#2884
I will give you something to think about. You were right... in worst case almost 100% of kmd can be locked with existing code

[07-Dec-19 12:33 AM] phm87#7395
about the 80% and liquidation, there was something about 5% or 2 times 5% ... and there is slipping when you dump too much coins ... so maybe I am wrong and it can get more bad

[07-Dec-19 12:39 AM] artik123#2884
A specific person can always/endlessly take the usdk that he have just got, convert them back to kmd and take another loan... i need to do the math but I think that he can actually lock as much as 3 times his initial kmd

[07-Dec-19 12:45 AM] phm87#7395
there is no incentive to do this, maybe he wants to loose/stuck money

[07-Dec-19 12:46 AM] artik123#2884
Of course there is... it's some sort of leverage

[07-Dec-19 12:47 AM] phm87#7395
no because you diminue the sum you have

[07-Dec-19 12:47 AM] phm87#7395
as you said, you can lock 3 times the initial kmd sum ... then ... you are stuck, you won nothing, you lost/stuck money

[07-Dec-19 12:48 AM] artik123#2884
Not true. Think about it. I must go to sleep now

[07-Dec-19 12:48 AM] phm87#7395
Have a nice sleep

[07-Dec-19 12:48 AM] artik123#2884
😴

[07-Dec-19 12:52 AM] phm87#7395
Let's do the math !
if 1 KMD = 1 KEUR
I have 100 KMD, I do a loan then I have 80 KEUR
I convert 80 KEUR to KMD then do another loan, I have 64  ... then 51.2 then 40.96 and so on
Using excel, I did the calculation, it tends to have 0 as output so that's why I think you'll end up with 0
Total sum is around 500 and not 3 times 100

[07-Dec-19 12:52 AM] phm87#7395
it is 1:52 AM here, good night buddy

[07-Dec-19 12:54 AM] artik123#2884
I didn't do the math... I was just guestimating it... if it's 5 times... then 5 times...more leverage

[07-Dec-19 01:05 AM] PHBA2061#2530
quick math: it's a geometric series with ratio = 0.8 so the sum will be = 100 x 1/(1-0.8) = 500

[07-Dec-19 01:12 AM] phm87#7395
the sum of all KMD locked is 500 but the amount you actually have is 0 at the end of all the small loans

[07-Dec-19 01:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But then a 4% move and your loan would be called in.....no risk of it not closing.

@jl777c 

How do you combine gdb with vim, for on-the-go debugging?

[07-Dec-19 03:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(I'm currently trying to become familiar with the new Termdebug GDB thing for VIM, but the docs are not very clear.)

[07-Dec-19 05:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(finally figured it out, but still curious about how you set up your debugger)

[07-Dec-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure why there was a long discussion on a point already agreed to, ie. there should be a closeaccount rpc call to allow self-liquidation (assumes you have > 50% equity)

[07-Dec-19 08:31 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@jl777c will you write something about EURK?  I would be happy to read about it in your blog.

[07-Dec-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i already wrote about the basic idea long ago. here are other docs on it:

@artik123 cool, yeah I missed the closeaccount meaning and seems it’s already taken into account.  Good question / discussion anyway, helps me understand better

Is it still possible to compile komodod on Debian 8?

isn't deb8 the one that needed 
`find . -type f -name 'Makefile*' -exec sed -i 's/\ \-Wint\-conversion//' {} \;`
to build?

[07-Dec-19 02:18 PM] zatJUM#9924
yes

[07-Dec-19 02:19 PM] zatJUM#9924
But perhaps my error is related to this one? (I've already removed some "-Wint-conversion", but will check if there's some left)

[07-Dec-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it could be that the libraries/compiler is just "too old"

[07-Dec-19 02:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
😦

[07-Dec-19 02:23 PM] zatJUM#9924
One day I'll have to upgrade 😉

[07-Dec-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no rush, the EoL was only 2018-06-17
