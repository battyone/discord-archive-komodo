Anybody compiled latest build of Komodo on Mac?

[07-Dec-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm getting 'configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO'

[07-Dec-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
quick google search says about error relating to `ld`

[07-Dec-19 01:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have ld version `ld64-450.3` 🤔

[07-Dec-19 01:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I tried jl777 komodo's beta branch and KomodoPlatform Komodo's beta branch

[07-Dec-19 01:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
using `./zcbuild/build.sh -j6`

[07-Dec-19 01:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
assuming using correct mac build file

[07-Dec-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain @Mylo @ca333

[07-Dec-19 01:22 PM] SHossain#0007
not `./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8` ?

[07-Dec-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
haven't tried that. I see in my command history logs, I also used the same build.sh previously when I compiled.

[07-Dec-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can give build-mac a try

[07-Dec-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
alright, initialised build-mac

[07-Dec-19 01:24 PM] SHossain#0007
i always knew `build-mac.sh` for macOS. not sure if that changed

[07-Dec-19 01:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't remember exactly about this part. done such things so many times for different setups, all gets mixed up.

[07-Dec-19 01:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway, thanks for quick reply mate. will let you know if still have any issues or success compiling 🙂 👍

[07-Dec-19 01:27 PM] SHossain#0007
cool

[07-Dec-19 01:27 PM] SHossain#0007
hope that builds for you 🙂

[07-Dec-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yeah... has to build it, mandatory update 😅

[07-Dec-19 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain it failed compiling. I'm trying on a fresh clone again.

[07-Dec-19 01:48 PM] SHossain#0007
let me try on my mac

[07-Dec-19 01:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm running Mojave, 10.14.6

[07-Dec-19 01:51 PM] ca333#0118
@grewalsatinder its `build-mac.sh`

[07-Dec-19 01:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ca333 yea mate, running build-mac.sh on fresh clone right now

[07-Dec-19 01:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[07-Dec-19 04:37 PM] SHossain#0007

[07-Dec-19 04:41 PM] Mylo#8306
Died within 2 weeks.  In Thailand, I caught a bus to the nearest shopping Centre 3.5 hours to buy an acer and Ubuntu.  It’s now back in Australia in a drawer at a friends place for next time I need data off it desperately.

[07-Dec-19 04:42 PM] Mylo#8306
From Thailand I took it to Bali, it charged up, but again died, so sent it back with a friend.

[07-Dec-19 04:43 PM] Mylo#8306
Now I have ryzen 5 laptop.

[07-Dec-19 04:49 PM] SHossain#0007
Ryzen 5 laptop sounds :shexy:

[07-Dec-19 05:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[07-Dec-19 11:34 PM] Slyris#2880
