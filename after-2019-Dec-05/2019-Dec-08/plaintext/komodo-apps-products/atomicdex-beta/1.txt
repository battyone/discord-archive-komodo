I tried atomic swap with new update. First, sound is a little annoying me. Second, fee is comming out once(if succeed the swap only right?). It was fantastic to me. Thank you devs!

[07-Dec-19 01:29 AM] saturday#4156
recent version, the fee is comming out  once and coin is out once.

Playing silent sounds on iOS is unlikely an option, it is an old and infamous trick, iOS reviewers are well-aware of it and it gets applications banned most of the time.

[07-Dec-19 03:01 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
But reading this discussion I see that the annoying sound is mostly the one we have when there are active orders but no ongoing swaps. I think we can tune the volume of that one even lower. And we can turn it off altogether on Android, where we don't have to play the sound all the time to stay alive.
Just my two cents.

HEX is now the 2nd largest erc20 by tx after tether, their Telegram community is growing rapidly, Richard Heart is a master at promotion and marketing, it would be great to see HEX  traded on AtomicDEX,  the exposure for Komodo would be awesome!

AtomicDEX could be the wings above HEX's wind, RH blows a lot of hot air!

Phones make annoying sounds so I always keep the volume off anyway. Besides that, AtomicDEX is really cool. Makes it very easy to diversify a portion of my crypto holdings. Not to mention getting exposure to some cutting edge projects.
Waiting patiently for some HUSH liquidity  **hint**

try HUSH/KMD... and forget about BTC... too slow, too expensive

[07-Dec-19 06:46 AM] Mark81#4505
Oh that sound on Android makes me crazy. I had to shutdown AtomicDex from background.

[07-Dec-19 06:50 AM] Mark81#4505
And this just for support to get ios work on background? Who even these days use Iphone? Go android or go home!

Ohm i just noticed that AtomicDEX has used 18Gbytes of data in one month period in Android phone. @ca333

[07-Dec-19 11:53 AM] Mark81#4505
Is that normal? Doesn't sound like.

[07-Dec-19 12:29 PM] ca333#0118
@Mark81 thanks for info - we are aware and for now its "normal" but we will improve this as part of networking and matching-engine refactoring.

[07-Dec-19 12:34 PM] Lennart#9331
great to hear, because as a side effect it also uses a lot of battery i suspect

[07-Dec-19 01:55 PM] mobipoi#5774
Hopefully atomic dex will  add other kmd based asset like supernet Revs and others

Does DEX not add to your wallet $ total by design?

[07-Dec-19 04:50 PM] Goku#9007

I have a question to a old function from BarterDex.
How was a trade secured with 0 confirmations?

Who controlled the private key of the collateral deposit?
