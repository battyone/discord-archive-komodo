[telegram] <Craig> "Does Komodo DEX support cryptonote coins such as Monero, Karbo, etc.?"
Im not surprised to hear this question, and I think it could be important.
It's easy to swap between ERC tokens with great liquidity, today. 
I don't think swapping between BTC and LTC, or DCR and RVN or whatever is going to be too exciting. Swapping within KMD ecosystem is quite a small niche still.
But a decentralized way to swap BTC to privacy coins could see a lot of volume.
People eager to anonymize their BTC might not need sophisticated trading tools. That matches the strengths/weaknesses of atomDEX 
Monero is like 100x more popular than ARRR, not to mention the cyrpto note clones trading exclusively on sketchy exchanges eg "crypto ogre" "crypto topia" where counterparty risk is gigantic.
Maybe crypto note is 100x more difficult to figure out the tech? I don't know, but the addressable market is big. 
Tl;Dr it makes strategic sense to prioritize ARRR, BEAM, or other privacy coins into DEX

[07-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea Monero type coins are tricky ones to crack but it is being worked on, though I think for difficult to add privacy coins, ARRR is likely priority. Its anon pool is huge, is in the Komodo ecosystem, and protected by dPoW which makes atomic swap trading far safer. Plus the Pirate team is excellent. (re @Craig: "Does Komodo DEX support cryptonote coins such as Monero, Karbo, etc.?"

[07-Dec-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But I agree 100% with what you said. DEXs that support privacy coins will be crucial for restoring privacy, even if it is simply to break the trail of ownership for other coins

[telegram] <Yagax> By when? Before the Dec 20 upgrade? (re @Acura360: Mandatory Update Agama
https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html)

[07-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> atomDEX has a few ways to succeed.
One is as a nice multicoin wallet, cool design, with a legit atomic swap feature. It could get lot of users who don't do too much trading, but it adds up. 
Another way is finding power users by dominating a niche. Offering a nice privacy solution for example. Or offering easy listing and exotic trading pairs (why isn't this happening yet?)
Regarding the privacy angle, breaking ownership trails, it the idea that many teams are working on this. If Komodo is among the first to pull it off it could be huge. In 18 months if there are ten other ways to do it then it's not such a big deal.
But yeah there are other ways the DEX could do well, especially with the browser news üëç

Anyone running the newest Verus in Native mode know how to fix an error like this:
"finished loading blocks 
Error: Failed to connect best block"
I'm guessing my database got corrupted but I'd rather not download from scratch or go to lite mode. Is there a way to do a CLI truncate or rewind to get back to a healthy spot? Any other ideas? Thanks for any help!
