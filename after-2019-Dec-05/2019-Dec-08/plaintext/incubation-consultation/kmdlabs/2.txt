Hi @LabsAssistant 
I've lost access to my KMDLabs server, and had no help from support for it within past 40+ hours.
As I'm lacking time to reinstall from scratch and to be realy useful here, I prefer to resign and give the chance to anyone else to learn and be usefull to Komodo.
Thanks you all for the opportunity you gave me to be LabsAssistant, then to be Notary node operator for Komodo.
Of course I'll continue to maintain my main and 3P Notary node.
Please remove me from LabsAssistant role.
:labs:  üññ

the original dragonhound is half pei, half rottweiler aparently, though I never met its parents

I like the big scary looking ones üòÑ not that the ones I have onw are that scary. If I had the option, a tibetian mastiff would be roaming the grounds

`I like the big scary looking ones`
then why sharps and staffs? get a real rott üòõ

[07-Dec-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
sharps and staffs are too cute to be scary

[07-Dec-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I like the lack of a bark, unless its serious. Peis are stealth as fuck

[07-Dec-19 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If my first impulse upon seeing it is to pet it, it's not "scary"

I've only seen him look scary once and bark agro, and the threat decided it was time to walk away. Its nice to have a cutie that can pick up when its time to go beast then woofs bass istead of yapping.

To continue staking on mainnet when the updates occurs, is master of pos64staker still fine?

[07-Dec-19 12:58 PM] penguin#0544
`The coming update includes staking optimizations that eliminate the need for third-party staking optimization scripts.`
Where can i find more details about this?

[07-Dec-19 02:33 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
code is nasty though and initial version allows little commands like wallet balance and sending

[07-Dec-19 02:33 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
what mostly needs testing is how deamons are handled

[07-Dec-19 02:33 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
sometimes I find it is hanging strangely with no response or so

[07-Dec-19 02:33 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe it's normal idk
