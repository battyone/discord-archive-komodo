the mining code needs to be changed to allow for zerofee tx without limits

[07-Dec-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
right now, only a few per block are mined

[07-Dec-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe the gateway/pegs tx can get an exemption in the miner, i think CreateNewBlock is the function

[07-Dec-19 07:38 AM] Alright#0419
-minrelaytxfee=0 should work I think

[07-Dec-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
but we dont want it for all tx, just for the pegs related ones

[07-Dec-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so a conditional for pegs tx, that does what minrelaytxfee=0 would do

[07-Dec-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo if we dont already have a way for a >50% equity account to be closed, we should add it. otherwise people who have a lot of equity but no other KMD available are locked out and can only withdraw more stablecoins

[07-Dec-19 09:21 AM] Mihailo#5902
Not sure what you mean?

[07-Dec-19 09:21 AM] Mihailo#5902
We have redeem of coins at any time for account holders.

[07-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
let us say someone borrows 80% against 1000 KMD deposit

[07-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
spends the stablecoins and has nothing else left

[07-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD price goes 10x

[07-Dec-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
now there is a lot of equity in the account, but how can it be extracted? seems only by taking out more stablecoins. is there a way to use the equity that is in the account and using that to close it out?

[07-Dec-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
whatever more stablecoins you take out, increases the debt, so you wont ever be able to take out stablecoins to get the stablecoins needed to close out the account

[07-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Mihailo#5902
If he has nothing left how will he close account. There is still little debt even if equity is high as he initially took X coins.

[07-Dec-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but on paper, this equity exists

[07-Dec-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
say 1000 KMD deposit and takes out 10 EUR worth

[07-Dec-19 09:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
Only if you want the account to be closed and partial funds returned to user and rest (debt covering) goes to pegs account

[07-Dec-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, for accounts with over 50% equity, it should be possible to close it out and get whatever net balance there is

[07-Dec-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
without any extra coins being used. i think it is a matter to just do the price calculation to reduce the amount of KMD equity that can be paid out

[07-Dec-19 09:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
We could maybe make it similar to liquidate. But pegs global account will be the one which "liquidates" this account and give the rest of KMD-5% to user and the KMD to cover the value of debt and 5% goes to pegs account

[07-Dec-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
why does there have to be a 5% fee in this case?

[07-Dec-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess closing an account that has more equity than the average would make the overall average a bit worse...

[07-Dec-19 09:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
It doesn't have to be, just saying if you have no coins maybe there should be a small penalty

[07-Dec-19 09:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes

[07-Dec-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and this is only possible by the account holder

[07-Dec-19 09:32 AM] Mihailo#5902
Big equity accounts will worsen the goobal ratio

[07-Dec-19 09:32 AM] Mihailo#5902
Even putting it in loquidating zone

[07-Dec-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
but trapping funds with a high fee barrier would reduce the funds flowing in the system. if i know that at any time, i can liquidate without penalty, that seems better from a user standpoint

[07-Dec-19 09:33 AM] Mihailo#5902
We have a ratio before liquodating is not available, before certain ratio of global account

[07-Dec-19 09:33 AM] Mihailo#5902
Lets give it a thought, when I start implementing

[07-Dec-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess we can make it so if overall balance is healthy, we can allow self-liquidations without penalty

[07-Dec-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise there would be some sort of liquidation fee, based on how close to danger zone the global balance is

[07-Dec-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
something like that
