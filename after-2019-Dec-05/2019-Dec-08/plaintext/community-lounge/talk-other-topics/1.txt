There have been many amazing moments in my Chinese market experiment, but the ‚ÄúThe International Cooperation Forum on Digital Economy and Blockchain‚Äù held in Hainan was particularly shocking. I was able to see vividly how the Chinese government plan and collaborate with companies when they strategically selected a new industry in conjunction with the national development strategy. The foundation of the blockchain industry is clearly growing at a very fast pace, growing beyond a small cyberpunk and developer community as an infrastructure for national collaboration.

of course what china does to its citizens is orwellian in the extreme, but it seems these large countries by and large do a good job of mistreating their own citizens. as long as they stay within their borders for such abuses, it seems within their rights and up to their citizens to deal with it.

everyone sees china's surveillance apparatus, but nobody bats an eye at other countries
i.e. uk has some 70+ cameras per 1000 people and the gov passed some "investigative powers laws" few years back with little to no public consultation which basically allows the police to snoop on anyone
