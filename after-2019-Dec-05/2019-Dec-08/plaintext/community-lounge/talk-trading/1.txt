@ChicoCrypto @jasonappleton Alright, I'll take you MMA for August of next year. But Jason has to be the promoter. All profits go to mutually agreed charity. You down Chico?

I think we may be in for some bounce

[07-Dec-19 10:10 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
bouncing downward or upward?

[07-Dec-19 11:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you throw something to the ground, I‚Äôve never seen it ‚Äòbounce‚Äô through the floor, so my assumption would be upward :troll_lol:

[07-Dec-19 11:52 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
If you see the reflection...., that something could bounce to the other side aka downward :troll_thuglife:

is there anywhere / any way to leverage kmd atm?

[07-Dec-19 01:45 PM] Neko#5830
I was hoping binance would open one since they have margin to some shitcoins but not komodo

[07-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Markus#5464
im not surprised either, i think one thing have to do with that kmd does not have high liquidity and if u look which alts u can margin then its only hype coins

[07-Dec-19 01:48 PM] Markus#5464
margin trading with kmd would never work in current situation, enough if a whale makes a 5x huge bet then market buys for 1 mil usd and he made a killing

[07-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Neko#5830
thats show how much room for growth kmd still has

[07-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Oszy#5734

[07-Dec-19 02:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Can someone make a cc where we can ‚Äúleverage‚Äù kmd trading? Ie lock up 1000kmd, 3x leverage. Kmd @ $1, if it drops under 70c, other party who takes on your bet gets your 1000kmd. If kmd goes higher than 1.3, you claim their 1000kmd

[07-Dec-19 04:11 PM] Markus#5464
strong bears

[07-Dec-19 04:13 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yeah that whole 15min candle was blue on my script... probably retrace it all

[07-Dec-19 04:14 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Difficult not to make bearish div with that huge wick from the other day

[07-Dec-19 04:14 PM] Markus#5464
some whale does not want it to pump

[07-Dec-19 04:16 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Bots and traders will react to the bear div, we'll just have to see how strong the bulls are now

[07-Dec-19 04:19 PM] Mark81#4505
Is this happening with same alts together than last time?

[07-Dec-19 04:21 PM] Markus#5464

the worst is that binance is the most liquid market for kmd and deposit time is like 3 hours

second attempt at 1K sats incoming

[07-Dec-19 04:32 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yeah fast block times mean nothing to exchanges, you wait no matter what. It's like they don't understand crypto :troll_rage:

There is a study on the differences in the top 10 holdings percentages within self directed retirement accounts at Schwab.  It shows differences between Boomers, Gen-X and Millennials.  They show that Millennials hold Grayscale Bitcoin trust (maybe this is a basket of cryptos?) at levels higher than some major bluechips.    They hold percentage wise more GBTC than they do in Disney, Berkshire, and Netflix.  Hope they don't get fleeced, but it shows in their eyes that crypto is legit. People pay a premium for that GBTC basket too.  I have much more than I can afford to loose in crypto with "unhealty bias" towards KMD, but I sleep well at night.  I don't think I would sleep well at night knowing the fifth largest holding of my retirement portfolio was mostly BTC.   https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-release/schwab-corporate-retirement-services-news/schwab-report-self-directed-401k-balances-ho

not surprising. looking beyond BTC means that you have to learn stuff, to separate real tech from marketing hype. how many people do that, really?

[07-Dec-19 05:14 PM] crumb#2550
in a perverse way, they are actually safer in BTC right now üò¶

i can't believe that above statement came from me :abusedsmily:

yeah i was just in an argument with some people who were claiming btc is anonymous and privacy coins are redundant. the amount of disinfo out there is impressive.

there was no btc crash before xmas

chances for crush after are much lower I guess? time to buy ?
