"209024368968204288";"artemciy_dice#0049";"07-Dec-19 03:01 AM";"But reading this discussion I see that the annoying sound is mostly the one we have when there are active orders but no ongoing swaps. I think we can tune the volume of that one even lower. And we can turn it off altogether on Android, where we don't have to play the sound all the time to stay alive.
Just my two cents.";"";"";

AtomicDEX could be the wings above HEX's wind, RH blows a lot of hot air!";"";"";
