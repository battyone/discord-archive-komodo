"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 08:06 AM";"so a conditional for pegs tx, that does what minrelaytxfee=0 would do";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:24 AM";"now there is a lot of equity in the account, but how can it be extracted? seems only by taking out more stablecoins. is there a way to use the equity that is in the account and using that to close it out?";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:25 AM";"whatever more stablecoins you take out, increases the debt, so you wont ever be able to take out stablecoins to get the stablecoins needed to close out the account";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:25 AM";"yes, but on paper, this equity exists";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:26 AM";"say 1000 KMD deposit and takes out 10 EUR worth";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:26 AM";"yes, for accounts with over 50% equity, it should be possible to close it out and get whatever net balance there is";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:27 AM";"without any extra coins being used. i think it is a matter to just do the price calculation to reduce the amount of KMD equity that can be paid out";"";"";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"07-Dec-19 09:28 AM";"We could maybe make it similar to liquidate. But pegs global account will be the one which ""liquidates"" this account and give the rest of KMD-5% to user and the KMD to cover the value of debt and 5% goes to pegs account";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:30 AM";"why does there have to be a 5% fee in this case?";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:31 AM";"i guess closing an account that has more equity than the average would make the overall average a bit worse...";"";"";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"07-Dec-19 09:31 AM";"It doesn't have to be, just saying if you have no coins maybe there should be a small penalty";"";"";
"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"07-Dec-19 09:31 AM";"Yes";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:33 AM";"but trapping funds with a high fee barrier would reduce the funds flowing in the system. if i know that at any time, i can liquidate without penalty, that seems better from a user standpoint";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Dec-19 09:34 AM";"otherwise there would be some sort of liquidation fee, based on how close to danger zone the global balance is";"";"";
