@artik123 strategic multipliers is a marketing / business dev problem, not a dev problem.  Atomic Dex is one way to leverage other users, coin gateways etc thru pegged dev as you mention.  But not a dev problem.  Dual daemon with coda protocol or other is also a new paradigm to explore.

Happy to continue chat in new year, but maybe not in discord.  Perhaps medium articles imo would have better stickiness

Happy new year @Mylo  !

I'm talking about the very core issues.

When steering in the wrong direction, no amount of effort could work.

Moving fast in the wrong direction leads to nowhere.
Usually companies/societies just hit the wall. And only after they hit it, 
they ask themselves the hard questions (and in many cases, sadly, even then, they cannot reach the right conclusions).
This ship has to change course.

Multichain is a good idea but komodo is not executing/capitalizing on that properly.

I can't recall, maybe stratis tried the cc and fell on their butt.

This system is not inclusive enough for devs withinside this community and outside. 
I think that the market sees exactly what I see.

There is no extra value to be realized by the market.

This discord is open for everyone. 
Anyone can read through this forum and know current and future plans, 
and the verdict is out: #62 --> ~$64m (Not bad, but a lot less than it can be...)

I don't believe in magic tricks.
My guess is that in reality FSM going to be something very limited. 
I find it hard to believe that it is going to replace *real* coding.

And on the other side of the bank, the utxo contracts are too complex. 
Over a year of development and maybe only 2-3 devs know how to write them. It speaks for itself. 

Devs wish to write code, if they can't find it here they will find it elsewhere. 

I don't wish to sound harsh, but let's open this system and make it inclusive for everyone.

It is something very important that is going to determine komodo market cap for years to 
come. Saying yes yes, and washing it under the carpet doesn't really solve the problem. 
This system has to be open as wide as possible (account layer, VM, sdk, windows etc.) and unleash the power of a real platform.

If I can change people’s mind on this one, the rest doesn't really matter.

_thinks most of this convo would be better served in a channel that isn't about a specific GUI and more of the target audience were likely to see_
