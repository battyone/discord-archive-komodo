[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Did you get presents this year?

[25-Dec-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> I didn't. It's either because I am bad or getting old... or both.

Silent Dragon Shell
The Silent Dragon Node case is nothing short of art. We worked with an amazing Designer Oliver Budd and also the amazing team from HUSH to bring the dragon head alive.

The real question is, will you be the next Queen of Dragons?

Signal Desktop is a horrible, unusable messenger application. I tolerated it being a slow resource hog, sure, but today it plain out gaslighted me: a message that I knew I sent disappeared from a conversation, and stayed hidden until I searched for a keyword that was in it
Twitter

[25-Dec-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I agree that inflation have a different effect in each country : In Belgium, many things are indexed on inflation (estimated with different indexes) such as employee salaries, tax rate pivot points, social contribution pivot points and so on. The aim is then to redistribute the taxes with maximum transparency (Belgian have many data and analysis on the expenses of the govts, France is less transparent in comparison). These huge amounts of tax money are not centralized in 1 single govt but splitted to 7 entities that have their own separate budget, this system was very useful during 2008 crisis: the govts were limitated in their stupid choices.

[25-Dec-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very interesting, and different, than the US

[25-Dec-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> There are special rules and limits to avoid nightmares as germany faced in the 1930's: Germany didn't pay to France some war debt money so France army occupied industrial centers (Rhur) then German govt was forced to pay salaries indexed on inflation BUT as no value was created from many industries, the German Mark value plunged leading to more bank notes printed and so on

[25-Dec-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> The country is very little so the public debt grows each time that they need something big. As example, belgium need 16 airplanes F 35 or sth like this. US offers try to push to buy more things to have good prices ... so it happens that they call police, navy and unrelated corps to give them army stuff (super vehicules, helicopters, ...) because they were forced to buy it. US have also the argument that they own many companies in Belgium (if Belgium buy russian stuff, US companies established in Belgium may close or move)

[25-Dec-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> BUT it is still very interesting to understand WHY so many companies unrelated to Belgium have headquarters or some buildings in Belgium : notional interests are one reason

[25-Dec-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> In nearly all countries, if a company need to create a debt to invest in sth, the interest on the debt are deductible as professionnal expenses. If doesn't apply if the company use its own cash

[25-Dec-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Look at Belgium on a map and you'll see why

[25-Dec-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> So Belgium created a notional interest, fictive fiscal interest. If a company invest 100 000 ‚Ç¨ from its own money, it can deduce as pro expenses some fictional interest

[25-Dec-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> yeah Belgium is tiny but there is Brussels into it and other stuff (beers)

[25-Dec-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It is a very key location.

[25-Dec-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> In between France, England and Germany

[25-Dec-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Not exactly, but you get my point

[25-Dec-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> belgium is full of "nuggets" : SWIFT is in Be, odoo (created by a belgian), one small Belgian company that have 60% of world market on compressor to create plastic bottles

[25-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> So, I'd like to play with notional interests and crypto, unsure how exactly but it can be cool

[25-Dec-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> US is very different than Belgium and other European countries

[25-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> US is entirely different

[25-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Culturally and fiscally

[25-Dec-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Few years ago, Will Smith the US actor was interviewed on French television. At the end, they asked his feeling about the new possible 70% rate of tax for the part of the salary above 1000 000 per year. He didn't understand the question at first then he was very shocked when he realized that it was a possible future reality in France

[25-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> US is Anglo-Latin Capitalist beast

[25-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Later, hopefully, the constitutional consil destroyed this 70% tax rate, saying it is unfair. In facts, few ppl are targetted by such laws and these persons have the money to change of country (Johnny Halliday was fiscally establied in Swiss paying max 500k ‚Ç¨ of tax per year)

[25-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> About US, I agree that the market can be more efficient than centralized govt

[25-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> But I still don't understand how it works about healthcare : we both agree that obamacare was more a problem than a solution. US doctors need to pay more insurances (because they are sued for random stuff) and are allowed to advertize, I didn't check numbers but I'm not sure that US healthcare system is more efficient in US

[25-Dec-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Health Care is shit in U.S
