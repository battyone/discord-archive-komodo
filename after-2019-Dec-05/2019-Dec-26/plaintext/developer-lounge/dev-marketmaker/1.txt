@jorian You have to import your address with rescan to your native daemon first so it recognizes your utxos.  e.g. `komodo-cli -ac_name=RICK importaddress "myaddress" "testing" true` MM2 doesn't do it automatically since it might take unpredictable time. You may import without rescan for fresh generated address that doesn't have UTXOs.
