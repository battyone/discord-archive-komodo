the order book is decentralized and p2p
more info here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>
> Would it be possible for a single order to be matched against multiple counter-offers in the future or there is a fundamental reason why it must be 1-to-1?
a maker order, once placed, does allow multiple takers who need lower volumes to fill it
but, it might happen with some delay as each taker's offer has to be filled by hash and timelocks on a blockchain(for utxo coins) and some confirmations are needed for confident trading","",""

If you wish to send to another address you control you will need to pay the typical transaction fee for that chain.","","üëçüèª (1)"
