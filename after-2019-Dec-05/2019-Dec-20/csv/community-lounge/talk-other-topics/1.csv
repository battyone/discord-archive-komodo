Meanwhile, the supply chain of time will be changed due to the p2p financial technology initiated by bitcoin, which the singularity university claims will lead to a new 3 billion people joining the global supply chain in the coming years due to the environment that hyperconnects represented by smartphones.

The explanation frame ""bitcoin was strong"" has been tested for systemic robustness to malicious hacking, resistance to skepticism close to media curse, control to maintain an edge in relations with alternative technologies, including ethereum, and its identity to the Stable Coin, called dollar coin.

For me, for the past 5 years, I have consistently argued for the frame of explanation and what it foretells, which I can say has been proven to some extent.

Now the next step to validate this descriptive frame is:
It is whether bitcoin plays a practical role in rapidly changing global supply chains. the core of the bitcoin attributes needed at this time is the ""finality of settlement.""

Regardless of Bitcoinâ€™s current price, the explanatory framework predicts that within the next five years, humans will see how ultimate and deadly the ""finality of settlement"" secured by individuals is due to Bitcoin.","",""

optimistic by the influx of institutional investors through institutionalization...
big companies are optimistic by entering the blockchain industry...
government and the central bank are optimistic by the blockchain interest...

there is no distinction between causality and correlation, no logical agony or experience, and full of people who just follow trends, narratives and catchphrases.

Instead of an essential understanding and exploration of technology, companies stimulate each other's FOMO with meaningless partnerships and media publicity to look pioneering. 
everyone is full of declarations of being a platform.

It is easy to predict their repeated moves every year.","",""
