Sorry if this has already been asked, but why pick DPoW over a token when a token on Ethereum represents a much more decentralized, and arguably more secure, solution? You can already pay gas fees in tokens via work on gas stations. My only other thought is the speed offered by a native chain, but of course you can always pick an Ethereum altchain/sidechain, although I admit that reduces security.","",""
