@sœÜldat I believe this comment to be sincere. 
It is useful for content creators to hear what the audience would like. 
Personally, I think the NN stuff is too ‚Äòinside baseball‚Äô and there‚Äôs a lot more that will have mainstream crypto interest.","",""

I was also interested in putting me as candidate for future elections and I have read explanations how NN works. But I didn't read anywhere where it stated that NN has to fund Komodo news and tutorials. Where does this rule came from?

Other question how does any VOTE token holders know what the ICT experiences are from all the candidates, do they check there LinkedIn profile?","",""

Last year, a number of candidates that were highly active in LABS (which has its own NNs for testing new things) won a spot after showing capability. 
There is also a testnet for candidates to participate in prior to elections, which offers a chance to figure things out and show what you can do, both in terms of actual notarisation and with writing code (and sharing it) to help all NNs improve node management etc - https://notarystats.info/testnet.php","",""
