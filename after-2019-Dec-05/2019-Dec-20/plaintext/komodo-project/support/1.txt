downloaded 2.015 and 3.0 versions and 2 days to sync.  After a restart I receive the splash screen and then is states "q for shutdown 100%" and then shuts down.

[19-Dec-19 02:52 AM] CryptoPope#3579
anyone able to provide guidance?

[19-Dec-19 03:00 AM] smk762#7640
check debug.log to see more info on reason for shut down - 
```
               Mac:  ~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/debug.log

which wallet's versions are these? 
> 2.015 and 3.0 versions 
ocean qt ?

[19-Dec-19 07:37 AM] gcharang#6833
if you are using the latest ocean qt, backup the wallet.dat , delete the blockchain data and resync from scratch or bootstrap

I have a question on the token module. So each 'token' is a coloured satoshi. Is the token itself again divisible in 100 million satoshis?

[19-Dec-19 07:50 AM] gcharang#6833
> Is the token itself again divisible in 100 million satoshis?
definitely no

[19-Dec-19 07:53 AM] gcharang#6833
if you want to represent an external coin that is divisible to 10^8 satoshis, you can state that each on-chain token is equal to one external satoshi
this is how it is being done for the pegs module

[19-Dec-19 08:04 AM] barv#0867
Thx @gcharang . I guess the same goes for the token module right? So if 1 token equals 1 satoschi, the token is not divisible?

I was reading here: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/tokens.html#introduction

[19-Dec-19 08:04 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, 1 smart chain token  is not divisible

[19-Dec-19 08:05 AM] barv#0867
Okay. Cool. It makes sense, but it was not 100% clear in the documentation

[19-Dec-19 08:06 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, will add more details
but there were more details and even an explanation about NFTs , wonder when that got removed ü§î

[19-Dec-19 08:07 AM] barv#0867
mmm. I read those somewhere today as well

[19-Dec-19 08:07 AM] barv#0867
Is the token module actively used by one of the ecosystem projects as you know?

[19-Dec-19 08:10 AM] gcharang#6833
i'm not sure
but it is used by most of the other modules
like channels, pegs, rogue etc.,

@PHBA2061 made a pokemon trading app using tokens as a Proof of Concept

[19-Dec-19 08:11 AM] barv#0867
Cool. And as there is quite some traction now on pegs is being well tested I assume.

[19-Dec-19 08:12 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, tokens module is well tested
pegs is still in development and implementation details changing constantly

[19-Dec-19 08:21 AM] barv#0867
Thanks @gcharang üôè
