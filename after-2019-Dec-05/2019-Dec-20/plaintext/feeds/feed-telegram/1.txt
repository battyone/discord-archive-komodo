[telegram] <Mixic> Throughout this process, the Graviex.net exchange has stayed completely on top of things, updating and getting in sync shortly after even the 0.6.0-3 release. 
They reopened withdrawals and deposits sometime last night for trading, with BTC, KMD, and USD markets. 
With that level of support, maybe a few more in our community should give them a shot as well.

[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Hi, can somebody please elaborate what the utility of the komodo coin will be in the atomicDEX?

[19-Dec-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Or in general?

[19-Dec-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> Payment for dPoW. More tx/s needed on a chain, more chains needed, more dPoW payments. 
Instant 0 confirmation trades if kmd as collateral
Kmd will be main coin of ecosystem so naturally has most liquidity etc and useage in trading as main pair
Kmd : stablecoin creation (recently being worked on)
Kmd being bought to pay out to DEX, or other Kmd assets, so buying pressure 
That‚Äôs a few off the top of my head

[19-Dec-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> Pretty sure there‚Äôs quite a few more use cases. Nothing is ‚Äúforced‚Äù ie you NEED to use Kmd to make it work

[19-Dec-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> But it has a lot of utility :p

[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Why is AtomicDEX not listed on CMC? What¬¥s the volume?

[19-Dec-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Less trading fees on AtomicDex if you hold more then 10KMD on your Wallet üëçüèª

[19-Dec-19 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Early Beta, also there are tons of tradingpairs that cmc can not be list.
Example 
Doge/Dash 
Dash/Dex
Dex/Bots
Vrsc/Ltc (re @CallMeDaddy: Why is AtomicDEX not listed on CMC? What¬¥s the volume?)

[19-Dec-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Ok, but does KMD have an utility other than less trading fees if you hold some? So exactly like BNB?

[19-Dec-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> that's why the team is working on a "komodo-coin-cap" (re @Acura360: Early Beta, also there are tons of tradingpairs that cmc can not be list.

[telegram] <Acura360> In August 2019, Komodo introduced nSPV technology, the next generation of Simple Payment Verification (SPV). This new nSPV technology is hundreds, or in some cases even thousands, of times more efficient than traditional Electrum SPV server methods.
As development continues on nSPV, several additional features are emerging.

[19-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RegulusR> You may have got it wrong, but I think these things can take away the usefulness of the original token on the network and hence its value which is what matters to KMD investors.
