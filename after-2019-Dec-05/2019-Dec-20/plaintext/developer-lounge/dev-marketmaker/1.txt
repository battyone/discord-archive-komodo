`it was assuming that vout1 of dex fee transaction(step0) would always be spent in alice->b_addr (step2)` is it possible to make this assumption always valid? It would allow for reliable historical volume tracking

can't seem to get around it otherwise, have been thinking of this for a couple days

if you cannot find the alice->b_addr tx given a DEX fee tx, it seems to make it impossible to correlate reliably

[19-Dec-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
you can kind of do it by comparing amounts, but that leads to issues of multiple swaps with the same amount getting jumbled up

[19-Dec-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
have been thinking of the smallest possible tweak to mm2 that would allow reliable volume data to be extracted from on chain, and this seems to be it
