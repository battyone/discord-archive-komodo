@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  Will this change in Komodo make my InnoSilicon , and Antminer Z9's no longer able to mine Komodo on your or any other pools?  And do you want me to shut down my miners for a few days while you upgrade  your server software?

chickenpool will be down for 5-9 minutes ~9 hrs from now for the final daemon swap
provided you properly set up your fail-overs on your miner you will come back to it shortly after it is back up

(if you didn't notice the downtime a few hrs ago, then you will not notice it tonight)

If you like it now, then you'll love it in the months to come 游땔

Awesome!  I can't wait...

Any chance you will also support mining DGB (Digibyte) in the future?  I would love to  move my other miners from Prohashing to Chickenpool for that algo....

it's possible, but not likely in the immediate future
It's been intentionally only equihash and only ecosystem coins since day 1 and I'm not sure how I feel about changing that

[19-Dec-19 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but there are some interesting features and setups to come
*or at least I think they are an interesting idea anyway

No problems  You have to do what is right for reaching your goals in the cryptoworld...
