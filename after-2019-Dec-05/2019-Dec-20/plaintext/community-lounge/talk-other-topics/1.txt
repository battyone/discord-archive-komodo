Peter Zeihan's "The Absent Superpower" predicts rapid changes that are close to the collapse of horizontal supply chains over the next decade, due to changes in geopolitical conditions related to naval power. Meanwhile, the supply chain of time will be changed due to the p2p financial technology initiated by bitcoin, which the singularity university claims will lead to a new 3 billion people joining the global supply chain in the coming years due to the environment that hyperconnects represented by smartphones.

The explanation frame "bitcoin was strong" has been tested for systemic robustness to malicious hacking, resistance to skepticism close to media curse, control to maintain an edge in relations with alternative technologies, including ethereum, and its identity to the Stable Coin, called dollar coin.

For me, for the past 5 years, I have consistently argued for the frame of explanation and what it foretells, which I can say has been proven to some extent.

Now the next step to validate this descriptive frame is:
It is whether bitcoin plays a practical role in rapidly changing global supply chains. the core of the bitcoin attributes needed at this time is the "finality of settlement."

Regardless of Bitcoinâ€™s current price, the explanatory framework predicts that within the next five years, humans will see how ultimate and deadly the "finality of settlement" secured by individuals is due to Bitcoin.

how everyone talks like a parrot every year?

optimistic by the influx of institutional investors through institutionalization...
big companies are optimistic by entering the blockchain industry...
government and the central bank are optimistic by the blockchain interest...

there is no distinction between causality and correlation, no logical agony or experience, and full of people who just follow trends, narratives and catchphrases.

Instead of an essential understanding and exploration of technology, companies stimulate each other's FOMO with meaningless partnerships and media publicity to look pioneering. 
everyone is full of declarations of being a platform.

It is easy to predict their repeated moves every year.

Bitcoiners be warned: this is what happens if @BinanceSGD finds you withdrawing to @wasabiwallet

Not surprised that my transactions are tracked, it's KYC after all

But I'm very concerned that Binance knew I was sending to wasabi, when all I input was a bc1 address, nothi...

was it below the normal KYC limit for binance?

using a centralized service with a known deposit address...

[19-Dec-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not much difficulty to see that a withdraw txid ends up at a specific address

[19-Dec-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
if you routed the funds through some different addresses first, then you would get a bit of plausible deniabiilty that it was you

[19-Dec-19 03:14 PM] Kayaba#5184
The centralization involves the fee address coded into the software, not the wallet to be clear

[19-Dec-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
atomic swap to a different coin and then back... that would break most tracking

[19-Dec-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
though if both coins are transparent, it can still be correlated by looking at the shared secret, unless it was a zatomic swap with some time elapsed.

DEF CON 27 Monero Village - Cathie Yun - Bulletproofs deep dive
Bulletproofs are important zero-knowledge proofs used in Monero to hide transaction amounts, but they can be used to prove other statements too. Cathie will walk through many of these applications and constructions. This talk will start at a basic level.
