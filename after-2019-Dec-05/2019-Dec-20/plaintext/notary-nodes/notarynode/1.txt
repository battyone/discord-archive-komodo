I hope everyone has a happy holiday period. 
In an effort to increase transparency, I have listed a tonne of details in relation to my Notary Node in the repo below. I believe NN's should be accountable for the promises made during the election period, and would like to uphold mine in an open manner. Feel free to peruse it, send me your questions, and I will continue to update it throughout my period as a KMD Notary Node. Thanks for those NN's doing good work throughout the community!
