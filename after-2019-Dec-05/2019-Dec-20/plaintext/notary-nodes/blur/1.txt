@kmdkrazy @Morningstar contribute constructively to conversation, and you won’t get banned 🙂

[19-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Biz#0842
I’ll unban @kmdkrazy since it was a first time offense. But Lucifer will stay banned

The link doesn't work for you? For me it does...

[19-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Biz#0842
Negative, I get a 404

[19-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Biz#0842
Or a “file does not exist”

[19-Dec-19 05:42 PM] artik123#2884
Maybe the %20 is problematic, try a different browser

A littlebit different paper but same idea

[19-Dec-19 05:45 PM] artik123#2884
Also you can read the book "Predictably Irrational" by Dan Ariely (chapter 3)

[19-Dec-19 05:53 PM] Morningstar#3399
Jules is still an idiot and you know it @Biz 
You made the worst people mods.
Now your discord is deader than dead.
Unban me!
Better reign in hell than serve in heaven!

```WTT:
my 2360 BLUR for KMD @ 1:1```

[19-Dec-19 06:11 PM] Morningstar#3399
Why would anybody do that? 🤣

[19-Dec-19 06:15 PM] Biz#0842
Thanks @artik123 !

[19-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Biz#0842
I think Jules is managing things well, for the record @Morningstar

[19-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Morningstar#3399
No he is not.
You claim to have an open discord but it is a dictatorship.
You are nazis!

[19-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Morningstar#3399
Nazicoin!

[19-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Biz#0842
You’re entitled to your opinion. But we don’t take orders from demons nor deities

[19-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Morningstar#3399
The last Nazi did follow my orders 😂

[19-Dec-19 06:18 PM] Biz#0842
Whose orders are you following?

[19-Dec-19 06:18 PM] Morningstar#3399
i have no god because i need none

[19-Dec-19 06:18 PM] Morningstar#3399
Which god are you following?

[19-Dec-19 06:18 PM] Morningstar#3399
The holy munny?

[19-Dec-19 06:18 PM] Biz#0842
I’d argue idolatry is still obsession

[19-Dec-19 06:19 PM] Biz#0842
Which it appears you subject yourself to all the same

[19-Dec-19 06:19 PM] Morningstar#3399
i can be very obsessed! I think i invented that.

[19-Dec-19 06:19 PM] Biz#0842
Perhaps. Ain’t healthy though

[19-Dec-19 06:19 PM] Morningstar#3399
Funny thing is, i never lie!

[19-Dec-19 06:19 PM] Morningstar#3399
do you?

[19-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Biz#0842
Of course I do. I’m human. Just, not about things that impact others

[19-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Morningstar#3399
i think that is a lie!
I can smell it.

[19-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Biz#0842
But that’s my subjective morality kicking in

[19-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Biz#0842
You know, belief in magick is just rooted in misunderstanding

[19-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Morningstar#3399
Are you a sinner? I have a place for you. It is warm and cosy 🔥

[19-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Biz#0842
Not what Dante told me 🥶

[19-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Morningstar#3399
Dante was never here.

[19-Dec-19 06:22 PM] Morningstar#3399
Now tell me my child, where is the premine.
Be honest, it is your last chance.

[19-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Morningstar#3399
Jeff?

[19-Dec-19 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[19-Dec-19 07:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[19-Dec-19 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Wen? Wen?
