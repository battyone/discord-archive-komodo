@jl777c There is still problem with mining on adaptivepow and having pricescc enabled.

No block for more than 10 mins. Can you try to mine on this chain and debug it?

[19-Dec-19 11:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
Here are params:
```komodod -ac_name=EURKTEST -ac_cc=2 -ac_import=PEGSCC -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_end=1 -ac_reward=1 -ac_perc=0 -ac_cbopret=5 -ac_adaptivepow=6 -dns=0 -dnsseed=0 -listenonion=0 -debug=pegscc-2 -debug=importcoin -debug=cctokens -debug=gatewayscc -printtoconsole=1 -addnode=116.203.17.140 -addnode=116.203.17.141 -earlytxid=a8e2624ba348a5eb00fc631d4cd8767a915d24b653a3c44ab87a5d33dccd6379```

[19-Dec-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
ok i will see if there are any issues, some block variance is always going to be there

[19-Dec-19 12:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think it is to much (tip went to 1000 before it found block). I think the problem is in rejecting prices stuff as it cannot calculate stuff for coinbase...

[19-Dec-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
that is 3x, it might happen once in a while, especially during turblent price changes

[19-Dec-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i cant connect to the chain

[19-Dec-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this is blocktime of 60 seconds?

[19-Dec-19 12:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes

[19-Dec-19 12:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
Try now, I was stoping nodes and starting in background

[19-Dec-19 12:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
So I can disconnect from nodes

[19-Dec-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
connection rejected

[19-Dec-19 12:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm able to connect

[19-Dec-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
what is your magic and port

[19-Dec-19 12:14 PM] Mihailo#5902
```"p2pport": 37586,
  "rpcport": 37587,
  "magic": -1343013210,
```

[19-Dec-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
mine are all different. let me switch branches

[19-Dec-19 12:15 PM] Mihailo#5902

[19-Dec-19 12:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
Use FSM

[19-Dec-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
building

[19-Dec-19 12:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is probably your latest modification for adaptive pow

[19-Dec-19 12:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
üëç

[19-Dec-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i was in the DEX branch, hadnt rebased

[19-Dec-19 12:18 PM] Mihailo#5902
Leave it to mine and check it from time to time. I had big pause more than 10mins on 1 minute block. Was mining with 8 cores.

[19-Dec-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will check. you should stop mining, so i can tell it is my node affecting things

[19-Dec-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, height 85, i am mining

[19-Dec-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
something is wrong... adaptivepow=6 seems to not have the expected effect. investigating

[19-Dec-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix

[19-Dec-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it might not need a hardfork, not sure, but my node is mining from where it used to be

[19-Dec-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it forked. probably best to start a new chain

[19-Dec-19 01:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, I'll update abd try

[19-Dec-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if you see W.3 or W.2 or W.1 it is incorrect

[19-Dec-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
those are the high frequency filters that adaptivepow=6 is supposed to not do, let me know when the chain is past block 100 and i will add one node to mine to track it

[19-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'll try with same chain, and if not I'll create a new one

[19-Dec-19 01:47 PM] Mihailo#5902
W.6

[19-Dec-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, W.6 and W.12 are the only ones you should see

[19-Dec-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, the adaptivepow=6 logic is working

[19-Dec-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and should avoid the large back and forth

[19-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
BTW, what is the logic behined aPoW params, what 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 means

[19-Dec-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
1 is all the windows active

[19-Dec-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
2 is not really used, legacy for a totally different method

[19-Dec-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
3 means all the filters and i guess works the same as 1

[19-Dec-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
4 means all the filter other than W.1

[19-Dec-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
5 is all but W.1 and W.2

[19-Dec-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
6 is all but W.1, W.2 and W.3

[19-Dec-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
7 is only W.12

[19-Dec-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
there are 5 windows 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 blocks wide

[19-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Mihailo#5902
And I suppose those windows means how often it will adjust difficulty

[19-Dec-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a variance that indicates an increased hashrate, it forces the blocktime to be slower

[19-Dec-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the DAA is adjusting every second, within the block, once a W.x is triggered

[19-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
Aha, and window is how far to look when adjusting?

[19-Dec-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[19-Dec-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the window is a detection width

[19-Dec-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so if in the last 1, 2, 3, 6, or 12 blocks it is solved significantly faster than expected, then it goes into adaptive mode

[19-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
Aha, ok. Similair to what I thought

[19-Dec-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
once it starts the adaptive mode, it stays active for 20, 30, 40, or 50 blocks or until the time deficit is made up

[19-Dec-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so it boosts the diff up to correspond with what it things the actual hashrate is

[19-Dec-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
then if after 10 minutes there is no block, it starts making it easier to cover the case where it was too aggressive

[19-Dec-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
so it isnt perfect, but over time the average blocktime ends up where it should be

[19-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Mihailo#5902
üëç

[19-Dec-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if it kicks in, the blocktimes will become much less consistent for a while but that is the cost for being able to recover from a billion-fold diff stranding

[19-Dec-19 04:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
It seems that it is working fine now üòâ

[19-Dec-19 04:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
I left it mining for some time

[19-Dec-19 04:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe the blocks are too fast but I'll let it mine more so that chain stabilizes

[19-Dec-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
genminingCSV rpc call will make a spreadsheet with all the blocktimes and other info

[19-Dec-19 04:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ah good, didn't know that

[19-Dec-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
takes 1000+ blocks at first to stabilize the blocktime

[19-Dec-19 04:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
