all of them are registered as msig signers when the smartchain is launched

it is automated, they only run a node. all the required code to do the transfers and locks is present in the komodo repo","",""

Are there any special steps when initially creating a stable coin chain in order to get the market moving? Let's say I create k-pickle. It tracks the price of pickles.
