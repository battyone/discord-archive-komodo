ultimately, any system that pays interest, needs to get the coins from somewhere. All the komodo pegged coins are 100%+ backed, so we cant just create it out of thin air. the 5% liquidation gains come from the accounts that have less than 10% equity left

[15-Dec-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so the risk takers are subsidizing the ones that didnt take as much risk. in exchange they had proportionally more stablecoins they could use in turn to liquidate other accounts, or spend, or trade

[15-Dec-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
many have complained that KMD lacked liquidity. once we have EURK, there is a much much larger amount of liquidity that can be tapped into. and it doesnt require selling on the open market

[15-Dec-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
does a coin having the ability to convert itself into stable form on demand, have extra value?

[15-Dec-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
in my mind it does, especially as the friction of charging interest is eliminated. i think in some cultures, anything that is charging interest is not allowed. and generally speaking having to pay interest is not a good thing and leads to all sorts of bad outcomes

[15-Dec-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so in the spirit of increasing freedom and interest, the komodo pegged and backed stablecoins are not charging interest

[15-Dec-19 10:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe another way to think about it, is that it is a way to margin trade KMD. When you do that typically you need to borrow coins and pay interest. I have not been able to find any coins that you can borrow at 5% a year.

since it is a useful feature and unique to my knowledge, i am sure effective marketing can be done for it.

[15-Dec-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont compete against the other crypto deposits that pay interest so it can be loaned out at higher rates

[15-Dec-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and it might be much more useful to existing community members, but the way i see it, that just makes it easier to get new people into the community

[15-Dec-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr it is not a copycat system that tries to compete against ETH/DAI

[15-Dec-19 10:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We just need fiat on/off ramps to accept the pegged coin, well exchanges too.

a fiat pegged Smart chain with nSPV Antara modules will make all my crypto dreams come true

The best systems in place without users or a place to spend it at, is just as good as the worst system. Let's not forget that utility is the driver of all things.

imo nSPV Antara modules in the browser will drive massive adoption
as it makes crypto more accessible to front end devs 
and, as there are no gas fees, users need not fear using it

[15-Dec-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
already have a couple of EUR gateways in discussions

[15-Dec-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
so you would be able to send the EURK to the gateway and do a SEPA transfer from there

[15-Dec-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and nSPV support for pegs and gateways chains are definitely needed and in development

it is not exactly the notary nodes, but rather composed of 13 msig operators. how would that work? is it automatet so they "only run a note" or do they need to copy pasta private key every time a loan is pay out? are they going to be paid?

[15-Dec-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833
> but rather composed of 13 msig operators
as jl said, they are going to be longtime commuity members (some of them past notary nodes)

>  how would that work?
all of them are registered as msig signers when the smartchain is launched

>  is it automatet so they "only run a note" or do they need to copy pasta private key every time a loan is pay out?
it is automated, they only run a node. all the required code to do the transfers and locks is present in the komodo repo

[15-Dec-19 11:16 AM] hastrup#8742
thats make sense.  is there a plan for if some of them go rouge?

[15-Dec-19 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They would need 6 others to all do the same im guessing?

So if hypothetically speaking I put 1000€ in KMD (let's say = 2000KMD) then I borrow EURK 700 and I use them, in the meantime KMD goes up 5x I put back 700 EURK and i get back 2000kmd valued at 5000€ but if it goes down I will get liquidated when a threshold gets reached and I get liquidated by another user who buys my locked KMD for a price determined how? Where is the documentation?

price determined by the decentralized trustless oracle that is created on chain as a part of the mining process
prices cc implements it

I think I understand the mechanism of the kmd-stable coin. Are there any special steps when initially creating a stable coin chain in order to get the market moving? Let's say I create k-pickle. It tracks the price of pickles. I lock $1000 kmd and receive $800 k-pickle. I'm the only person with K-pickle. Kmd looses value and the account is at less then 80% backed. At this point, are my kmd indefinitely locked as there is no market and I got k-pickled?

[15-Dec-19 04:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@joe2x4  somebody could liquidate the kmd backing the kpickle at that point

[15-Dec-19 04:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If no one else had kpickle it would be stuck

[15-Dec-19 04:06 PM] joe2x4#5987
So in a thin market, it will just be locked until someone liquidates it. Also maybe this situation won't happen as there is a cost associated with chain creation, as why would anyone want to spend money for a stable coin they really can't use.

[15-Dec-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
probably not a good idea to run a stablechain on a whim, it takes commitment and also need a federated set of signers that can be collectively trusted not to collude. in case one goes rogue, or more likely unresponsive, then the funds can be moved to a new msig address based on a new set of signers, but this process is not implemented yet

[15-Dec-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the nightmare scenario is if the backing drops so fast in a day, that the liquidation cant keep up and it never rises above that price. in that case, the stablecoin value should be prorated to whatever the amount backing it is. though with tether, it doesnt seem to matter so much the amount that is backing it

[15-Dec-19 04:23 PM] joe2x4#5987
In regards to artik123 comments about the 5% kmd rewards going to the signers, to me it doesn't seem to far a stretch that eventually we will see competing stable coin chains. EURK+ pays 1% back and signers keep 4% type of thing.

[15-Dec-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing prevents this. our reference version wont be doing that, but any coin can be used for backing (bitcoin protocol) and if using KMD, the msig signers are free to use it however they want, including rebates

[15-Dec-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a full matrix of possible stablecoins as the backing coin is independent from what is being pegged

[15-Dec-19 05:16 PM] artik123#2884
I've changed my mind. jl you have very compelling arguments. Better to keep it the way it is for now

[15-Dec-19 06:17 PM] hastrup#8742
in case one goes rogue, or more likely unresponsive, then the funds can be moved to a new msig address based on a new set of signers.......thx for the answer.

[15-Dec-19 09:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
This might be of interest xdaichain.com ,  some crucial differences but is a close analogue .  Pretty good idea they have ,  stablecoin based version of Eth .  Their format may be a good candidate for the dual daemon approach that jl777 wrote about a little while back.

[15-Dec-19 09:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Where the one coin is a stablecoin and the other chain which gets burned on to is the dual daemon ( could be Eth , cosmos , NEO whatever clone ).  This makes any crypto tech stack  priced in fiat .
