[15-Dec-19 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
that is all of them for sure?

[15-Dec-19 08:02 PM] TonyL#3577
yes, no any timestamp filtering

[15-Dec-19 08:03 PM] Alright#0419
oh nope >.<

[15-Dec-19 08:03 PM] Alright#0419
ok, yep likely an issue with my script, could you dump txids of each step for me?

[15-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
for every swap ðŸ˜…

[15-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
oh does that include old RICK/MORTY chains?

[15-Dec-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
yeah, it parsing `all` RICK/MORTY swaps

[15-Dec-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I can use timestamp of genesis of new RICK/MORTY to filter by time also

[15-Dec-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
lemme try

[15-Dec-19 08:08 PM] TonyL#3577
numbers lowered a little bit more ðŸ˜…

could you dump all 5 txids of each swap for me please?

[15-Dec-19 08:10 PM] Alright#0419
two separate dumps if you can please, one RICK/MORTY, one MORTY/RICK

[15-Dec-19 08:11 PM] TonyL#3577
sure, let me check how to grab it

[15-Dec-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
```wc -l rick_morty_txids.txt 
8964 rick_morty_txids.txt
wc -l morty_rick_txids.txt 
10848 morty_rick_txids.txt
```

[15-Dec-19 08:43 PM] TonyL#3577
wrote only 3 txids for each swap (taker/maker payments and spent) without fee tx

[15-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL is it not possible to get dex fee txid as well?

[15-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
that's mainly what I needed

[15-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
thank you, can try to work with this, but dex fee txids would be most useful

[15-Dec-19 09:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, when wake up I can make two more dumps with fee txids only
