900k burn a month, 9 months in fiat left and 2776BTC (19m) so about 30months left for LISK to deliver

but you cant just deliver and then stop, there is long term maintenance that is needed

assuming many other hyped projects also followed the same expenditure (we also know how ZEC handled their financial responsibilities) they might have may be another year or 2 year's juice left.... unless they again raise money somehow either by scamming or taxing etc. (which I doubt they can pull off again).
would be good as komodo gets some light on real innovation and organic marketing in such events.

these parameters will change drastically if BTC moves- up or down, where I believe UP is the more likely...
so that would extend their mileage, buuut it seems the whole core organization is not operating very harmoniously so that won't really help

true, having more value in hand to sell and run for a little longer will help some, and also very possible that some will actually make it somewhere in market with something usable. But I doubt many of those will still handle their financial budget responsibly. If they don't, they are out of the business sooner than later.

1. It will be bifurcated into platforms and content.
2. never beat the capital of a large company.
3. only natural artists or experts survive.
4. make yourself a specialized brand.

Would you be prepared to have your face scanned to be able to buy a mobile phone? That's the new reality for Chinese citizens.

So who wants to bet that (if they exhume) the founder of Quadriga CX isn't in his grave?   How morbid.  Just keep your funds off of exchanges and let the dead bodies resting in peace.   https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/14/business/lawyers-exhumation-gerald-cotten-intl-scli/index.html    I guess these lawyers are even worse than vultures.

Cryptocurrency tycoon died leaving $145m in limbo. Now lawyers see...
Lawyers representing users of the collapsed Quadriga CX cryptocurrency exchange platform are requesting that Canadian authorities exhume and examine the body of its late founder, Gerald Cotten, to check if the person buried there is really him.

On second thought, Cotten seems as shady as they come, faking his own death doesn't seem far fetched to me.  Not after reading about 200 millions in unsubstantiated deposits that he wrote into existence under his pseudonymous Chris Markay accounts. Unbelievable.   See  p35
