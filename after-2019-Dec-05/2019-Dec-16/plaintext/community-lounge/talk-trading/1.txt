@richardt making fun of scams is fine

[15-Dec-19 07:47 AM] Deltazulu#2710
on daily the 100MA is well supporting the price and on weekly the bollinger bands are getting real tight

[15-Dec-19 07:48 AM] Deltazulu#2710
looks good

[15-Dec-19 09:21 AM] CoinKing88#1540
@richardt As long as the top 10 / top 25 on CMC is flooded with projects that are more "show than go" i am not worried. I would be worried if the most liquid and big projects in terms of marketcap (although that doesn't say as much as many people think) would be technical superior as well.

We have not gotten to the part of the show where FA matters. In saying that since we are still in the top 100, i think FA is not being totally discounted ðŸ™‚

FA means?

fundamental analysis

[15-Dec-19 10:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
ie, the tech and actual utility of a project, rather than "pumpamentals" ie TA

[15-Dec-19 12:48 PM] Markus#5464
disbelief phase about to be over

Or we go lower, nobody knows

[15-Dec-19 01:22 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Personally i think that the 2017 burst is a huge outlier

[15-Dec-19 01:45 PM] Neko#5830
some people know

[15-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Neko#5830
not me tho

[15-Dec-19 02:32 PM] Markus#5464
if u understand how TA works it makes sense

[15-Dec-19 02:33 PM] Markus#5464
previous resistance becomes new support if it holds and the other way around

[15-Dec-19 02:34 PM] Markus#5464
and it works well on larger timeframes like weekly / monthly

[15-Dec-19 04:24 PM] richardt#2807
@CoinKing88 The people pulling the strings know. TA/FA is really just us trying to guess what they're thinking ðŸ˜„

Seems like most of the time, we're wrong

[15-Dec-19 07:34 PM] tolken#2655
Funny thing is that we should be able to simply invert the sentiment and be right most of the time. Good luck with that ðŸ˜›

[15-Dec-19 07:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@tolken but if i paint the market to go down and i know you will think it will go up, i will push it down to win yet again ðŸ˜„

[15-Dec-19 07:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It could take a big dump for more pain i guess

[15-Dec-19 07:58 PM] Markus#5464
another failed attempt to break 8.3k

Thoughts on alt season before or after btc halving?

[15-Dec-19 08:08 PM] Markus#5464
At this moment it looks like alt market cap possibly creating a lower high which would be a good thing. So what im hoping is for bitcoin to calm down and start going sideways to let alts start their recovery

[15-Dec-19 08:08 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I'm expecting small alt season before halving.

[15-Dec-19 11:27 PM] richardt#2807
@tolken The difficult part isn't being right. It's being right at the right time

[15-Dec-19 11:28 PM] crumb#2550
yeah, good timing is always part of the trading/investing equation

[15-Dec-19 11:29 PM] crumb#2550
hindsight is always 20/20

[15-Dec-19 11:32 PM] richardt#2807
I think next alt season will probably only happen to certain alts. Unlike the last one.

[15-Dec-19 11:33 PM] crumb#2550
don't discount madness of the crowds

[15-Dec-19 11:33 PM] crumb#2550
herd is a powerful and irrational force

[15-Dec-19 11:35 PM] crumb#2550
there will be new generation of noobs who don't understand what market capitalization means and will chase every "cheap" coin and token out there. beginning with likes of ripple and dogecoin

[15-Dec-19 11:56 PM] richardt#2807
Given it's history, LTC and DOGE are probably good bets ðŸ˜‚
