@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 make your own discord, no shit

[15-Dec-19 09:47 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
If I do that will you copy/paste everything from the 48000 labs and notary channels over to there?

[15-Dec-19 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
make a bot? idk

[15-Dec-19 10:17 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
If I knew how to make a bot, then what good would you be? :troll:

[15-Dec-19 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
here's an idea though

[15-Dec-19 10:18 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
can't just have any random muppet on my server

[15-Dec-19 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
don't directly tell someone that can ban you to "go fuck yourself"

[15-Dec-19 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
sorry "and, kindly, fuck right off with a fuck stick"

In the close to 2.5 years you've known me, what part of our interactions thus far would lead you to believe that there's a part of me that would treat someone "special" for no other reason than "hierarchy"?

[15-Dec-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
idk you seem to have a pragmatic thought about once a month

[15-Dec-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
figured you could use it now

[15-Dec-19 10:20 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

general update on LABS... 

Cannot contact joker at all. This isn't normal. Even when he fucks off for a few days on discord, I have other means of communication that he would normally respond with. 

If I don't hear from him within about a day, we will start transitioning all of our infra to komodoplatform repos prior to the fork. There's a good chance ac_notarypay will need to be disabled for a little while. I'm deathly afraid to touch it other than deactivating it entirely. I'm not confident I won't introduce an inflation bug.

The CFEK cluster is likely to die off for a little while as well.

[15-Dec-19 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
Optimally, we would use pos64 branch as our new master, but he left it in a half working state. If anyone has time to work on this with me, let me know. We don't have much time at all to get it working if we go this route

spoke to him, just seems burnt out to me

[15-Dec-19 04:57 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Should see if you guys can muster the strength to work together one last time this year just to stabilize the master branch:abusedsmily:  and then close out 2019 with a well deserved holiday break and start fresh in the new decade 游땏

[15-Dec-19 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
We don't have an issue working with each other. He just has less time on his hands lately. When he is around I shove a million different things to be done at him, and then he just fucks off again 游뱎

[15-Dec-19 05:35 PM] bishop#9773
What's the last _good_ branch? Pos64 broke things on my end from a syncing standpoint. I can get LABS synced using JL's master, but then no notas.

[15-Dec-19 05:36 PM] bishop#9773
I needed to remove cfekpos1 from assetchains.json too.

[15-Dec-19 05:36 PM] bishop#9773
Was pretty close to purging the whole thing and starting fresh

[15-Dec-19 05:42 PM] Alright#0419
sorry what do you mean "then no notas"

[15-Dec-19 05:42 PM] Alright#0419
LABS should work exactly the same from jl's repos

[15-Dec-19 05:43 PM] Alright#0419
our master will work just fine as well, I reverted the broken code. If latest master *is* giving you issues, please describe them in detail

[15-Dec-19 06:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
sometimes iguana can randomly stop notarizing, restarting iguana should solve it

[15-Dec-19 06:48 PM] bishop#9773
As in I haven't had a notarization since the pos test when everything went to shit

[15-Dec-19 06:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
you run the pos test on the same notary node ?

[15-Dec-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
Can help you fix it in about an hour if you want @bishop

[15-Dec-19 06:56 PM] bishop#9773
@PHBA2061 Yes, with all the nonsense back and forth, it was hard to determine if were supposed to

[15-Dec-19 06:56 PM] bishop#9773
i'm down @Alright Just ping me

[15-Dec-19 07:03 PM] bishop#9773
if there is anything you need me to do in advance, do let me know so time is productive

[15-Dec-19 10:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
the KMDLabs repo is solid... the revertHF branch has been working for me so if it was all pushed to master... then KMDLabs/komodo/tree/master should be fine

[15-Dec-19 10:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
then only issue I see so far is the one kmdkrazy found early on before this all borked to hell...

[15-Dec-19 10:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
and that is a corrupted wallet.dat will kill what should be a working node and stop it from syncing properly.

[15-Dec-19 10:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
for NN... wiping komodo and .komodo directories, then rebuilding KMDLabs/komodo/tree/revertHF  as your daemon and cli will get ypu in sync... sync in manually not with NN start script

[15-Dec-19 10:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
you will need to bootstrap KMD... no getting around that as for some reason... this version gets stuck at this height I noted yesterday...

[15-Dec-19 10:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
``` "blocks": 1635295,
  "longestchain": 1660848,
after that it would never start the daemon sadly...
Error: Failed to connect best block```

[15-Dec-19 10:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
So instead... bootstrap it and then manually run it to get to best height.

[15-Dec-19 10:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
Then edit assetchains.json in StakedNotary directory to remove all but LABS. With any luck, start.sh should now run properly.

[15-Dec-19 10:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
As far as StakedNotary goes... the pos64 branch might not fully work for everyone... and I am not sure which branch should be reverted to...

[15-Dec-19 10:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
It does appear @Alright pushed commits to the master branch, so we may be good to use master for both going forward... will require someone other than me to test.... im going to be out for several more hours tonight
