#JL777 summarizing how a crypto-backed stablecoin will work within the $KMD ecosystem! Innovating constantly!

Platform-wide update to add such features will commence on December 20, 2019 at block height 1,670,000 for those curious!

[15-Dec-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think the simplest way to explain Komodo decentralized stable coins is this: it is you taking out a line of credit on your KMD. You deposit KMD into a special address, you receive 80% of the value in a NEW stable coin which you can spend or do whatever. If your deposit value falls below the 80% amount you had withdrawn, ANYONE can liquidate your account by sending stable coins and receiving your KMD. 
You still have your stable coins, but the stable coins used to liquidate your account are destroyed. This way liquidators keep the price stable and it doesn't need a single issuing entity. All coins are +100% backed, no trust needed

[telegram] <stk> So, simply put, KMD now acts as THE RESERVE CURRENCY? (re @Regnar: I think the simplest way to explain Komodo decentralized stable coins is this: it is you taking out a line of credit on your KMD.

[15-Dec-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <stk> in laymen's view, BTC is backed by stable coins such as USDT. Now, any1 can issue a stable coin denominated in KMD, then what? üòç

[telegram] <stk> All is well. Just up the price a bit plz. :)

[15-Dec-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> A stablecoin can be pegged to a common fiat currency, such as USD or EUR. The stablecoin can also mimic stocks, external cryptocurrencies, and other assets, so long as reliable price-data can be accessed through an online application programming interface (API)
