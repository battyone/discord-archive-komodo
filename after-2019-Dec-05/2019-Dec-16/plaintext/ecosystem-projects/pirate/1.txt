[dscrd-prt] <Y5ive> @Draeth let’s have everyone go to Pirate Bay forum. Pirates-forum.org and Let’s make some noise on their forum. My name on there is “Piratechain 100% Privacycoin” Best marketing name ever! We can all come in there with a Piratechain tag name. That’s easy marketing. What you think?
