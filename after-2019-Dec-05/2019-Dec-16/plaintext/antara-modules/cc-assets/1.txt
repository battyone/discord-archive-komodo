yeah me too, I love trading card games, & I own a few NFT on Ethereum. I've never played MTG though, just watch it on twitch a few times

@polycryptoblog cool man.  I have some py cloud stuff to do atm, same sorta at scale stuff, so mixing in rpc from kmd chains can be done imo.  Iâ€™m new to py so will be busy getting the hang of it.
The volume of Opensea and some of the games is astonishing.  Iâ€™m not that kind of player ðŸ™‚ quake is like coffee when Iâ€™m back home
