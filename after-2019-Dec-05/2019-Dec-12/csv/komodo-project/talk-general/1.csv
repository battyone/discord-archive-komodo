Maybe here we can have at least some sort of monitoring so if something strange is happening with notaries it could be exposed and handled immediately.

But if I remember correctly here they cannot do much. Only if 33 of them collude ,most that can happen is that komodo state will not be notarized to BTC. And regarding to 7 signers with mal intentions I'm not sure what can happen.","",""

I was thinking about an idea of oracle that tracks BTC fees. 
So that notaries tx fee will be just enough to be included in the BTC chain but not more than that.  My guesstimate is that over time it will save at least half of the costs and also increase notarization reliability (I remember a problem that we had when notaries tx's were not included because of BTC tx's fees were rising and the chain was full).

For a different use case it can be applied for tracking KMD in a way that a user can pay a predictable amount of fees in usd terms regardless of kmd pump or dump.

Tracking kmd fees, for example, can also be applied for smart chains that are notarizing into kmd. It could help them also to lower costs.

Maybe it can even support something very close or even zero fees (Just up to the point tx's are included) for smart chains.
So if tx's are not included in kmd chain because miner decides not to include them or the chain is spammed it can be raised back dynamically.

Even if technically there is no viable way to have zero fees, it is still worth thinking about it and developing it because everyone is trying to do that and in order to compete we would have to find ways to do the same and this direction looks like the best effort so far. 

But no matter how low fees can be, ""zero fees"" still makes a huge psychological difference in terms of decision making.","",""

Generally people are full with irrationalities and this one is a well known bias studied by Dan Ariely(behavioral economics prof). People are hopless suckers for the word ""zero"". I Don't know how exactly zero fees can be implemented here(or at least just for the smart chains) but it could be a huge huge step forward.
(In order to do that others are adding a layer of trust and it kind of conflict with kmd principles).

Tl;dr this feature alone worth millions in marketing terms and it has a totally different perception in the eye of the user or decision maker imo.","",""
