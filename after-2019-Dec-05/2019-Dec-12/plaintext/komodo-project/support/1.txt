hello there what is the best way to move all my data files to another location for my Komodo QT client to access?

[11-Dec-19 10:47 AM] Razzler04#2552
I can

I can't and don't want 20 G plus worth of data on my windows local user profile, want to move it elsewhere

you can move it anywhere, but then you have to start with -datadir=PATH parameter

@Razzler04 what oszy said 
<https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030462-starting-the-komodooceanqt-wallet-with-command-line-parameters-in-windows>
the article has instructions on how to start the wallet with command line parameters

if the new location was "D:\komodo-data",
the parameter to add would be: `-datadir=D:\komodo-data`
