[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is really nice to see

[11-Dec-19 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM welcome back, stranger ðŸ™‚

[11-Dec-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Lightning network is fassst

[11-Dec-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> yes

[11-Dec-19 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> But establishing channels and having liquidity takes time and need onchain tx

[11-Dec-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> How much BTC?

[11-Dec-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> it depends of mempool congestion, sometimes it is cheap, sometimes it is expensive

[11-Dec-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> To establish a channel, you have to have how much BTC?

[11-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> But now, big CEX are getting involved into LN : bittrex allows LN deposits and withdrawals

[11-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> you can establish a channel with 10$ worth of BTC

[11-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> but with the cost of BTC onchain tx, I prefer to create channel for at least 50$ worth

[11-Dec-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do you actually make any money, or not really?

[11-Dec-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I don't because I'm not a business not a liquidity provider on LN

[11-Dec-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Big liquidity providers makes some money, 1% per year max (LNbig)

[11-Dec-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> and businesses makes money but it is unrelated to LN not BTC

[11-Dec-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> 95% of my utilisations of LN were for paying beers so it is impossible to make any money when you pay beers, whatever the crypto or the tech

[11-Dec-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @phm87 hahaha
