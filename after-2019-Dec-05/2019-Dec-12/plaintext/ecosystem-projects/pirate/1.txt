[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> you need to setup wget64.exe

[11-Dec-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> unfortunately i'm not familiar with windows

[11-Dec-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <0786> wget to which url

[11-Dec-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> you don't have wget

[11-Dec-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> wget is needed by the .bat script to fetch the params

[11-Dec-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> you need to install wget on your machine

[11-Dec-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35004832/wget-exe-for-windows-10>

[11-Dec-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <0786> I downloaded wget but unfortunately does not appear neither on path / system or env variables

[11-Dec-19 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <0786> so I guess fetch-params.bat/sh has wget inside and since my cmd does not define wget on system shows this error

[11-Dec-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> copy wget to the same folder that has fetch-params.bat

[11-Dec-19 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <0786> did

[11-Dec-19 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <0786> oh 
```
    .\wget64.exe --progress=dot:giga --continue --retry-connrefused --waitretry=3 --timeout=30 https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-proving.key -O %APPDATA%\ZcashParams\sprout-proving.key
```

[11-Dec-19 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <0786> it was written ``wget64.exe`` instead of ``wget.`` changing my file name to wget64 fixed the issue

[11-Dec-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> @mrlynch I don't know where that batch file comes from, but on up-to-date Win10 systems, the batchfile could be changed to use
```
bitsadmin /transfer BOOTSTRAP /download /priority foreground https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-proving.key %APPDATA%\ZcashParams\sprout-proving.key
```
That would eliminate the need to download external software.

@ercwl I agree with this tweet, but also be aware that Zcash *already* has an anonymity set of 15,000 ‚Äî by far the biggest anonymity set available today. I just made a z2z transaction, and there is no information about it visible to you on the blockchain.

[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @kp only 1% of their transactions are shielded, our anon set is bigger

[11-Dec-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> Wonder if he is intentionally lying or if he thinks pirate is too small to matter. Irritating nonetheless

[dscrd-prt] <grfx> hello guys what channel is a help me chanel here ? üôÇ

[11-Dec-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> @grfx depends what you need help with?  üòâ

[11-Dec-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <grfx> I have a problem with one of my transactions yesterday - it dissapeared from my wallet locally and never moved to the other one

[11-Dec-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <grfx> i did mention on the agama wallet chat but I do not know if this is the right place

[11-Dec-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> Was the wallet fully synched up with the chain?

[11-Dec-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <grfx> yes 100%

[11-Dec-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> I'd wait for the answer in the channel you posted then

[11-Dec-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <grfx> will do thanks - just wanted to make sure I post in the right section

@zooko @ercwl Very unexpected of you @zooko 
You really don't know or pretend that there is NO other zk-SNARKS only blockchain in privacy cryptocurrency ecosystem?
How could you not know about @PirateChain ??
@ZcashFoundation is at least aware about it.

@zooko @ercwl @PirateChain @ZcashFoundation In anonymity set bases @PirateChain beats Zcash to the dust. It's the only privacy transactions blockchain based on zk-SNARK tech which only allows private transactions over network, except the dPoW transactions.

[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Anyone giving out paper wallets of ARRR for the holidays?

[11-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> no but thanks for the gift idea now

[11-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> give my dad something to go learn when i drop tha tin his lap

[11-Dec-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> im gonna opera winfrey those for xms

[11-Dec-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> may be a dumb question, how do paper wallets fair on chains, when forks and other major chages happen?  wallets need updates, but do paper wallets?

[11-Dec-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <azpex9> Is there a weekly meeting beginning?

[11-Dec-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> @theekgb Good question! For the most part I think they fair just fine, as it's basically just keys/addresses on chain.  If a fork needed users to swap coins, then you'd probably need to swap them, other than that I think there's no need to do anything   
(Please correct me if I'm wrong!)

[11-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> @azpex9 in one hour

[11-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> are those meetings open, never seem to catch them

[11-Dec-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> ty for the answer on paperwallets, just made me think, you give someone in the past a bond note or liekwise, you just sit and forget, wanst sure if paperwallets faired as well over 5-10 yrs without intervention

[11-Dec-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> some chanins seems to have less core changes, so the risk (bitcoin as example) seems less concern, but other chains otoh have more core changes

[11-Dec-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> cause I am so ropping paper wallets on my family this xmas, grand idea, but I also know most of those will sit until 10 yrs from now lol

[11-Dec-19 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <azpex9> Excellent points @theekgb on paper

[11-Dec-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> @theekgb yes, everybody can join and listen to the weekly meetings

[11-Dec-19 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> @theekgb hmmm this spawns an idea. 
We could use a -mandatory update only- system people could sign up for somehow.  ü§î

[11-Dec-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> long game good idea

[11-Dec-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> hard to track 12 coins hard required updates thourgh all the noise

[11-Dec-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> prjects thinking big picture, and covering the disaster angles cant hurt

[11-Dec-19 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> idk...as an engineer it makes sense, but there is the idea of to much to manage on the admin side

[11-Dec-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> im just a user thus far in the arrr world, and kmd

[11-Dec-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Could just be a simple email system of some sort, go to site, sign up, info to make sure it doesn't go to spam + mark VIP/URGENT

Then emails only sent out when necessary.

[11-Dec-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> love it, has my rubber stamp approval ü§£

[11-Dec-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> I will def use it, cause after I hand them out, gaurentee I have to watch out for those wallets down the road, cause at least half wont do anything with them, I will be lucky if we get 1, but thats hwo this works.  1 is what its all about, each one is steps.

[11-Dec-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> it wil be my job to recollect those who dont and keep them alive, family is family after all, so I am kinda like the wallets maanger in this scenario, and I am not sure how much that comes up, but thats how I got there.

[11-Dec-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <azpex9> After reading how Lite isn't suitable for large amt I got qt. It took a day to sync but love it. Now syncing #SevenSeas and it's only at 1%

[11-Dec-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> there is bootstrap

[11-Dec-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> download the file and extract on %appdata%\komodo\PIRATE

[11-Dec-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> then re-open the wallet

[11-Dec-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <azpex9> I'll try a few things. I'm just a believer in the zksnarks like others here

[11-Dec-19 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> what do you mean?

[11-Dec-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <azpex9> Well I have two PC's so I could just thumb drive copy the chain from the qt PC and put it in /PIRATE

[11-Dec-19 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <azpex9> I see blocks folder is 4.90 GB so I'm going to find a large thumb drive and work at it.

[11-Dec-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
