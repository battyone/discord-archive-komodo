Even if it goes to $0.01, still be happy that you're in the best tech

[11-Dec-19 01:00 AM] Lanii#8302
@richardt You don't think that the tech is obviously not the best if it goes to 0.01?

Unfortunately  my opinion that kmd is finaly dead seems  come true...there was a short pump from 10 to 13 k and now gowing to 7 makes no sense...seems this  was the beginning of a row of exit pumps .... kmd delivers amazing tech...we all know that...there are no doubts. We all claim that kmd is something special..others than other coins but if this is true why kmd behaves like the average market? It makes no sense because kmd is not like the average. I think people dont realise that.
Look at tezos for example...its a special coinand yes...look at  the course...going up...it has partnerships for real usecases and people realise that....

[11-Dec-19 06:26 AM] coingirl87#6489
Now you can say " why you dont sell all your kmd?!"

[11-Dec-19 06:27 AM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd was a decision for life...so i never will sell kmd...if kmd goes to zero...okey...thats pitty but thats life

[11-Dec-19 06:36 AM] Acura#2748

Don't lose faith because the market is down. No amount of marketing can help against a bear flag. Let it play out, it'll bounce. If you want to see real pain, just look at lskusd

Take a look at this chart, see the blue candle that was not fully retraced... that level needed to be tested, you can't do marketing to prevent that, this just how price discovery works: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7obe128s

what gives with this wailing and clamouring? global fiat monetary system is a gargantuan beast and quick successes can not be expected-
the change in value from speculative to tech value takes a long time - how long did it take with the flippening from horses to automobiles?
It _is_ a marathon, as a certain developer guy keeps pointing out occasionally üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÉ

Waves I try to do marketing and keep the price.  It doesn't seem to have worked.  Something good must be doing komodo when the top 30 always passes down.  the problem is that new shits do not stop and the fools prefer to put their money there, someday the fools or the money will end

[11-Dec-19 04:32 PM] richardt#2807
People will always go for the new stuff, just the way it is. Also doesn't help that KMD is still viewed as just a Zcash fork or just another privacy coin

[11-Dec-19 04:33 PM] richardt#2807
In hindsight, probably changing the name as part of the rebrand would've been a good thing

[11-Dec-19 04:37 PM] richardt#2807
Look at it this way, would any of you want to buy a  coin that already previously got pumped and dumped?

[11-Dec-19 05:05 PM] joe2x4#5987
Also doesn't help that the general public doesn't care about crypto. It's just too friggin complicated to get and use especially when things like venmo is so easy. I'd prefer a retro approach,  user printable stable coin notes for gifts, trading, and gambling.

[11-Dec-19 05:08 PM] joe2x4#5987
Holding a $10 stable coin note in my hand will make it seem very legit, and easy enough to send by any grandma.

[11-Dec-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is counterfeits

[11-Dec-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
let us imagine a $10 stable coin note that has a paper wallet inside, it cant be outside as then anybody can see the privkey

[11-Dec-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it is inside, you cant verify it

[11-Dec-19 05:19 PM] joe2x4#5987
Hmmm, I guess it would be used by people who trust one another. The other group who doesn't trust each other, maybe it works with an app to verify the note has what it says on it, or just instantly transfer it. Maybe some form of zero knowledge proof would be included. All of this, way above my head. But I mention this as a way to affect UX. A new series on Netflix,(the toys that made us) details the rise of starwars , he-man, gijoe, etc figures. Holding a physical toy made the characters "more" real. It is in this concept that I envisioned a physical crypto note.

[11-Dec-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it can be a minituarized ledger type of device without any pin. so possession of it allows you to spend whatever is in it and you can verify what is in it, along with proof of the privkey

[11-Dec-19 05:38 PM] Alright#0419
such devices exist already, but they still rely on trust

[11-Dec-19 05:38 PM] Alright#0419
can try to find what it is called if anyone is interested

[11-Dec-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
done properly, it could be trustless

[11-Dec-19 05:39 PM] Alright#0419
@polycryptoblog that guy in NY had one, do you recall the name of it?

[11-Dec-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess you need to prevent the privkey from ever leaving the device. which of course is likely impossible

[11-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Alright#0419
the way it was explained to me, it was flawed. Basically it was an nfc chip, you could use it to check pubkey(and therefore balance)

[11-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Alright#0419
but I was thinking just change the pubkey

[11-Dec-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe you can make it so that an untampered device can be known to not revealed privkey

[11-Dec-19 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
was a tiny hardware wallet essentially, couldn't extract keys from it from what he claimed

[11-Dec-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
pubkey is no proof of privkey, it needs to be able to sign it and also not allow the privkey to ever be extracted

[11-Dec-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
with all the sidechannel and clever attacks against a physical device, it seems doubtful that it can be protected against.

[11-Dec-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it was only $10, then maybe it isnt worth extracting

[11-Dec-19 05:42 PM] Alright#0419
if you were going to accept one as payment, you would need a computer to check balance anyway

[11-Dec-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so we need to wait a few more generations until secure hardware wallets can be 10 cents each

[11-Dec-19 05:42 PM] Alright#0419
at that point, use a normal hardware wallet

[11-Dec-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
hardware wallets built into the average cell phone seems to me like it'll accomplish the same thing

[11-Dec-19 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
that is already happening, and seems objectively better than any device that would physically change hands each transaction

[11-Dec-19 06:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Alright  Tangem ,  I have been in touch with them but they want a pretty penny for integration, the integration comes with 10k cards and that brings up the 2nd point we need to have a way at efficiently selling/distributing them

is anyone displaying trading volumes from atomicdex? or is atomicdex set up in such a way where aggregate vol data cannot be pulled?

is possible to do via on chain data, requires a machine to run all chains though

yes, but you can find other address

[11-Dec-19 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
and check it on other chains

[11-Dec-19 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
kind of sucks because you have to check every other chain

[11-Dec-19 07:17 PM] jorian#4555
yeah, that is overly complicated

[11-Dec-19 07:18 PM] jorian#4555
'they' should just enable the volume again like in mm1.0 days

[11-Dec-19 07:18 PM] ffffffff#0658
could atomicdex integrate its own counting feature?
