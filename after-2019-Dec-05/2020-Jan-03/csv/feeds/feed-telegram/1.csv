"455021680935436290","Gateway#3763","02-Jan-20 11:24 AM","[telegram] <Regnar> It's brand new front end software for AtomicDEX desktop, written in Python. It is a wallet and atomic swap service like AtomicDEX except this also has Bot features so you can automate your buying and selling (eg. Buy KMD if it hits N price, sell if it hits N+1, repeat) 
it also has API key access to Binance, so you can link a Binance account on it and trade on Binance from this interface. Additionally you can automate trades between Binance and AtomicDEX, for example you can set the bot so that if KMD is N% cheaper on Binance than Atomicdex, the bot will buy on Binance and sell on Atomicdex, netting you Arbitrage profits.
