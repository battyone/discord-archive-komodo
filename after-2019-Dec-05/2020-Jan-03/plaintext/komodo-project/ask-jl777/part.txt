i have the chains up. they will keep running

[02-Jan-20 09:06 PM] SHossain#0007
we are still at block 0. best thing about this is no mining needed

[02-Jan-20 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
its very fast to sync the chain! as it has no blocks

[02-Jan-20 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if these were 1kb datablobs, the 10 million of them would be 10GB in less than an hour

[02-Jan-20 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
2TB per week. just not practical to store all that data

[02-Jan-20 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
there are DC that gives unlimited bandwidth with 100MB/s

[02-Jan-20 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
tomorrow i will add realtime joining, so hopefully a new node can jump in to a 5k/sec blast and get 100% of the packets

[02-Jan-20 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
OVH also does that with faster speed i guess on some of their servers

[02-Jan-20 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, plz coordinate with server operators so we can verify performance across many different geolocations

[02-Jan-20 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
by this time tomorrow, i should have realtime joining working, that will make things much smoother as it wont be required to be coordinated when to join

[02-Jan-20 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
a single "chain" could support many video broadcasts in parallel

[02-Jan-20 09:10 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. we can set a date for the next mass public test. i'll post in #notarynode  #kmdlabs and maybe in #official📢 channels for any interested participants with required knowledge to join

[02-Jan-20 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and with realtime joining, basically you can have arbitrary number of such chains, each one being like a different channel you can tune into.

[02-Jan-20 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it really just needs a passive follower node

[02-Jan-20 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess being able to run a blaster would be good too, so that can be spread out across N nodes

[02-Jan-20 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
did you notice the numbers are going down now? 🙂

[02-Jan-20 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
purging from memory

[02-Jan-20 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
every second

[02-Jan-20 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it purges from memory 59 minutes ago to make room for the next second

[02-Jan-20 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what allows it to reuse the same memory in a circular buffer

[02-Jan-20 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
each second is actually an openhashtable, so there is a circular buffer of 3600 hashtables and in realtime it is switching from one to the next

[02-Jan-20 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
most all computations are in constant time

[02-Jan-20 09:16 PM] SHossain#0007
the numbers are matching on both nodes as they are being purged

[02-Jan-20 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes since 100% of the 9million are in sync, then each seconds data would also be in sync

[02-Jan-20 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
only searching the hashtables for packets is a linear search, but that is once per second to scan through 8192 spots. not a big amount of computing

[02-Jan-20 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i estimate each 100 tx/sec will use up 1% of a core, though with this last test it was much better than that

[02-Jan-20 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, this is just the lowest level transport and it isnt doing anything with the data. any time needed for processing the data will be in addition, but do that in a different core and nothing slows down

[02-Jan-20 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow it is stable doing overlapped rpc calls, and it has no locks internally

[02-Jan-20 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
very happy with its performance

it was an adrenaline filled test today 🙂

[02-Jan-20 09:23 PM] SHossain#0007
yesterday was just getting warmed up

[02-Jan-20 09:25 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks to @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 for quickly getting me a script to launch 100 instances for this test

[02-Jan-20 09:26 PM] SHossain#0007
but, those 100 or 30 instances on a single server lead to hub and spoke kinda networking. better result is achieved with running a single daemon on a single server

[02-Jan-20 09:27 PM] SHossain#0007
still not sure what is wrong with my 1st alien server

[02-Jan-20 09:47 PM] Hember#5341
I have no idea what I just read, but I felt the adrenaline, too.

You just read history being made  @Hember  ~  WoW !!~ setting  DEXRDO node  up @SHossain

bit late to party... still need testers?

[02-Jan-20 11:06 PM] dude#6062
I'm set g2g, i'll await for instruction to start blasting 🔫 😏
