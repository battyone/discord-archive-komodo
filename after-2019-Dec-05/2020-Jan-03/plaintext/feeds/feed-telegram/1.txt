[telegram] <t0sma> I use Brave to claim my reward on Magnum wallet. (re @TensaZangetsu2: I heard Chrome updated and Firefox not support U2F so Ledger not working with them. How people use ledger now ? MEW not working too I send last time eth tokens using Ledger Live app because with browser MEW not works. But I cant claim KMD directly from ledger live app. I trying Opera browser too but claim kmd not working too.)

[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> I dont have Brave. You know its work with not wallet but with github claims ? I dont want install any wallet because I have Ledger and he is my wallet. (re @t0sma: I use Brave to claim my reward on Magnum wallet.)

[telegram] <t0sma> I use my ledger with Magnum wallet. You can access to your KMD from Magnum. No need to change your wallet. Just import. No risk because your keys stay i  the ledger.

[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> Hm ok I will try later and check.

[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> Regnar what is makerbot exactly?

[02-Jan-20 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It's brand new front end software for AtomicDEX desktop, written in Python. It is a wallet and atomic swap service like AtomicDEX except this also has Bot features so you can automate your buying and selling (eg. Buy KMD if it hits N price, sell if it hits N+1, repeat) 
it also has API key access to Binance, so you can link a Binance account on it and trade on Binance from this interface. Additionally you can automate trades between Binance and AtomicDEX, for example you can set the bot so that if KMD is N% cheaper on Binance than Atomicdex, the bot will buy on Binance and sell on Atomicdex, netting you Arbitrage profits.

Fully decentralized p2p orderbook and more
I had thought that there would already be an easy to use module to spawn a p2p network that would synchronize any sort of data that wasâ€¦

[telegram] <Regnar> Yea I stumbled upon it looking at smk762's github because he does a lot in Python and that's the language I know. It's seriously cool and impressive, but is of course testing purposes only. (re @TheCrabbyPaddy: Well damn)

[telegram] <RegulusR> Hi. How does the Komodo team handle listing of KMD in exchanges? Anyone who wants to list it, is there any objection or does Komodo usually specify the official exchanges that KMD is trading in?

[02-Jan-20 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RegulusR> And how is the process of listing a currency on AtomicDex? A stablecoin for example?

[02-Jan-20 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Anyone is free to list KMD,  typically retweet their announcement if the exchange or service is reputable.   There is a form on atomicdex.io for coin communities that are interested,   There is a fee .   We have added some stablecoins independently but mainly the big ones.   Depends on the project on what gets added independently
