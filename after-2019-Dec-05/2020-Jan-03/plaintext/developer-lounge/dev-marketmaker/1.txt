but it seems possible to use rpc and avoid hex on some simple p2sh scripts <https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/68235/funding-and-spending-a-no-multisig-no-segwit-p2sh-tx>

does someone know how to use the `my_tx_history` call? i have MORTY enabled natively, with the address imported. balance shows correctly and i successfully did a RICK/MORTY trade. i issue the `my_tx_history` call to see the transactions done, but all the output says is: 
```{"current_block":223580,"from_id":null,"limit":10,"skipped":0,"sync_status":{"state":"NotEnabled"},"total":0,"transactions":[]}}```

you need to set `tx_history` to `true` in the coins file
never done that though, i don't know what implications it has

I have a lot of ```Warning, can't rename RaiiRm("/tmp/lt-dht-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.tmp") to "DB/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/lt-dht": Invalid cross-device link (os error 18)``` lines with mm2-1019c60b7. Is it a problem?
