Hi! Has anyone got WLC21 working in native mode with latest verus wallet? On mine it loads forever and when  trying to "getinfo" from CLI it responds: "CLI response:
Config file for VRSCTEST not found. Cannot load WLC21 information from blockchain."

@Mark81  Lite mode is working, I think @metaphilibert is investigating Native mode?

@phm87 and @metaphilibert  will do a manual about staking shortly, @phm87 has been doing staking from a small device, I will put the manual shortly in our website as soon as I have it
