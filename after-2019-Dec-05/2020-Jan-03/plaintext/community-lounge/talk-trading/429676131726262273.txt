[02-Jan-20 11:00 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Has anyone been able to buy from that 30kmd SUPERNET offer on AtomicDex? I have tried a few times and it never gets past negotiated

[02-Jan-20 11:22 AM] Oszy#5734
that's been there for ages must be an outdated mm2

[02-Jan-20 11:23 AM] Oszy#5734
let me try

[02-Jan-20 12:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
May want to add a feature that lets you ignore a certain order after x amount of fails

[02-Jan-20 12:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Otherwise if itâ€™s by far the cheapest, could completely stop orderbooks

[02-Jan-20 12:06 PM] cipi#4502
AtomicDEX bans the pubkeys of such nodes till you restart it
have you tried to buy some of the other SUPERNET from orderbook, the ones with a higher price?

[02-Jan-20 12:07 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
If you try to buy with a higher price won't it just match the lower priced order?

[02-Jan-20 12:07 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
that's what happened with the similar situation with DEX about a month ago

[02-Jan-20 12:07 PM] cipi#4502
normally yes, but i hope that if the lower price offer is from a banned node, it would not try that

[02-Jan-20 12:08 PM] cipi#4502
the banning stuff is new

Unfortunately, the next best price is about 50% higher

[02-Jan-20 12:09 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I will continue waiting

[02-Jan-20 12:10 PM] cipi#4502
look again :-)
i made an order with a price of 31...

[02-Jan-20 12:11 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
ok will try

[02-Jan-20 12:13 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
nope

[02-Jan-20 12:13 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
matched with the 30 again

[02-Jan-20 12:14 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
the problem with the ban is that this swap never actually fails

[02-Jan-20 12:14 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
it just hangs. I can't remember how long I have left it previously but this time has been a day now

[02-Jan-20 12:15 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I've had to shutdown mm2 to get rid of the pending swap before. It seriously bogs down when it is stuck

[02-Jan-20 12:15 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
ill try with the mobile app

[02-Jan-20 12:16 PM] cipi#4502
i am also trying... first try it tries to swap with the bad node...

[02-Jan-20 12:16 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
ah supernet isn't on mobile

[02-Jan-20 12:18 PM] cipi#4502
ah yes, but the result would be the same anyway

[02-Jan-20 12:18 PM] cipi#4502
weird... looks like my swap is working

only seeing 1 in progress now. Still loading so slow

[02-Jan-20 12:21 PM] cipi#4502
what is loading slow?

[02-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I am using pytomicdex and when I have the pending swap stuck it just bogs down the machine

[02-Jan-20 12:22 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
shows completed but no change in my balance either kmd or supernet

[02-Jan-20 12:23 PM] cipi#4502
strange... i haven't seen this problem on my nodes... but i am not using pytomicdex...

[02-Jan-20 12:23 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
it's probably due to low memory on the vps I am using

[02-Jan-20 12:24 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
could also be my local connection and unrelated

[02-Jan-20 12:24 PM] cipi#4502
`completed` could mean `finished`, but `failed` swaps are also `finished`

[02-Jan-20 12:25 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
sorry yeah pytomicdex lists it as finished

[02-Jan-20 12:26 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
the 1st trade is still 'negotiated'. the 2nd one I tried at the higher price is 'finished' but no trade

[02-Jan-20 12:26 PM] cipi#4502
the last event that mm2 writes to the swap files is the `finished` event... it means mm2 will not touch this swap any more (autmotaic recovery or something)... but it could be a failed swap

[02-Jan-20 12:27 PM] cipi#4502
my swap only waits for a notarization on SUPERNET, looks good

[02-Jan-20 12:27 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
doesn't appear in my failed swaps, but it's not always accurate

[02-Jan-20 12:28 PM] cipi#4502
maybe it is still pending, so it does not appear in the failed swaps... i guess it will there when mm2 decides it can't do anything about it and writes the `finished` event to the swap file

[02-Jan-20 12:33 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
restarted mm2 trying again

[02-Jan-20 12:35 PM] cipi#4502
which version do you use? is the coins file ok? it needs
```
    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,
```
for SUPERNET

[02-Jan-20 12:36 PM] cipi#4502
my swap finished... with the 30 KMD offer

[02-Jan-20 12:36 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
[MM2 v2.0.1417

can you try a version from here: http://195.201.0.6/mm2/
or build one yourself from the repo

[02-Jan-20 12:40 PM] cipi#4502
eg http://195.201.0.6/mm2/mm2-latest-Linux.zip

[02-Jan-20 12:41 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
download the binary and replace mm2?

[02-Jan-20 12:41 PM] cipi#4502
yes

[02-Jan-20 12:41 PM] cipi#4502
just replace the mm2 executable with the one from the zip

[02-Jan-20 12:44 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
dang.. seems to have broken pytomicdex now:(

[02-Jan-20 12:45 PM] cipi#4502
hmmm... damn... seems pytomicdex needs the older version... i guess it is because of some changes in passphrase/rpc_password handling

[02-Jan-20 12:48 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
yeah and pytomicdex is abandoned now. Ugh. Was so helpful compared to the cli

[02-Jan-20 12:48 PM] cipi#4502
you can also try some older versions from http://195.201.0.6/mm2/, but the right way would be to update pytomicdex to support the newer versions

[02-Jan-20 12:49 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Are there any other cli tools out there?

[02-Jan-20 12:51 PM] cipi#4502
the makerbot, but i don't know if it is ready to use
i only use my own script, but it only updates the prices regularly and does not help with CLI handling

[02-Jan-20 12:52 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I know smk762 mentioned he was working on a gui, but I really like the tui just to help visualize my orders and trades.

[02-Jan-20 12:56 PM] cipi#4502
i guess someone who knows python would be able to fix pytomicdex really quickly...

[02-Jan-20 12:56 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
yeah that isn't me sadly

[02-Jan-20 01:18 PM] Oszy#5734
@Patrick Crypto worked for me

[02-Jan-20 01:19 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
yeah it's not pytomicdex it's an issue with the newer version of mm2 for me... libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.22' not found

[02-Jan-20 01:19 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
to the marketmaker channel i go

[02-Jan-20 01:22 PM] cipi#4502
update `libstdc++6` package...

[02-Jan-20 01:23 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I've tried that

[02-Jan-20 01:32 PM] cipi#4502
btw, if you build your own binary, it will work with the older libstdc++6 too

[02-Jan-20 01:33 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I got it

[02-Jan-20 01:33 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
not sure what I did differently but it's working now
