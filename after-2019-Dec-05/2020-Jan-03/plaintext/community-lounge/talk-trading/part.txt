@Patrick Crypto  I'll test pytomicDEX with an updated binary this week and see if I can sort it out. What exactly is the error?

@Lanii every candle with such a massive wick on kmd 4h chart got dumped right away, just some whale that market buy to a certain price to trigger bots then sell into them

[02-Jan-20 04:56 PM] Lanii#8302
Yes but I like how they test proper before dumping

@Markus is there any merit to chart the tears of traders. TA could mean tear analysis. More tears might signal a bottom.

@joe2x4 i believe we need a final capitulation before a reversal is to occur

[02-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Markus#5464
to get rid of last weak hands

[02-Jan-20 06:22 PM] joe2x4#5987
What level do you see it going down to? ~$.40 ?

[02-Jan-20 06:56 PM] CoinKing88#1540
more like 30-25 cents, 40 is not even that far away ðŸ˜¦

[02-Jan-20 07:11 PM] Markus#5464
@joe2x4 it depends on what btc does and if there will be any buying pressure on kmd/btc pair to hold value up
