[05-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
no

[05-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
lol man I fixed it very hacky way

[05-Dec-19 07:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
json is not string...

[05-Dec-19 07:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yopui broke it

[05-Dec-19 07:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
get_int

[05-Dec-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
what you gave me before fucking off was broken

[05-Dec-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
I made it work, not sure what you've done since

[05-Dec-19 07:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it worked for me the whole time... not sure how you broke it... but an in is not a string

[05-Dec-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 setstakingsplit 5
error code: -1
error message:
JSON value is not an integer as expected
```

[05-Dec-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
you cunt

[05-Dec-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
you literally undid the fix

[05-Dec-19 07:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

[05-Dec-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
lmao

[05-Dec-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
that happens every time for me on every machine I've tried it on

[05-Dec-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
*except* with my code that fixed it

[05-Dec-19 07:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that RPC doesnt work for you like 90% of them wont

[05-Dec-19 07:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
static const CRPCConvertParam vRPCConvertParams[] =

[05-Dec-19 07:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anything listed there is converted to be able to read int instead of string...

[05-Dec-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
give me another example of one that won't work

[05-Dec-19 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
that hacky ass GetAmount thing worked for me

[05-Dec-19 07:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand. how you did it.

[05-Dec-19 07:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works the same as all otehr rpc

[05-Dec-19 07:41 PM] Alright#0419
I'll give you access to a machine that's doing it if you like

[05-Dec-19 07:41 PM] Alright#0419
I've literally not seen it work once on the 6 or so machines I've tried

[05-Dec-19 07:41 PM] Alright#0419
*except with the fix you removed

[05-Dec-19 07:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works on ALL of mine

[05-Dec-19 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
anyone lurking right now?

[05-Dec-19 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
someone try this rpc command please `setstakingsplit 10`

[05-Dec-19 07:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
your fix didnt remove the conversion, so it failed... if you want to do it that way you need to remove `setstakingsplit` from `vRPCConvertParams`

[05-Dec-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
worked on my machine :troll:

[05-Dec-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
that's exactly what you're telling me now btw üòõ

[05-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
```
        std::string strperc = params[0].get_str();
        int32_t perc = std::stoi(strperc);
```

[05-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
what is the issue with this?

[05-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
this is what I found works

[05-Dec-19 07:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
getccdisables 100

[05-Dec-19 07:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that is exacrtly the same as the setstakinsplit

[05-Dec-19 07:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
does that work?

[05-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
```
 komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 getccdisables 100
error code: -1
error message:
JSON value is not an integer as expected
```

[05-Dec-19 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 estimatefee 100

[05-Dec-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 estimatefee 100
-1
```

[05-Dec-19 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
:troll:

[05-Dec-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
again, is there an issue with this? 
```
        std::string strperc = params[0].get_str();
        int32_t perc = std::stoi(strperc);
```

[05-Dec-19 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-Dec-19 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to remvoe the conversion to parse it as a string

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
what is wrong with it

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
it does work as intended, just unsure if it'll break something otherwise

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IT DOESNT WORK

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
lol

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ity says JSON is not string as expected

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
you realize we're saying the same thing to each other over and over?

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-Dec-19 07:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
stop it

[05-Dec-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
