```the new staking algo will activate in about 6.5 hours```Sorry I don't have enough time to read it all.
Will I have to do something special to my staking node?

[05-Dec-19 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
that is in reference to this new CFEK chain, not LABS or any other chain

[05-Dec-19 01:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
wait 7 PM tonight?

[05-Dec-19 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
you'll want to remove any blocknotify scripts prior to fork

[05-Dec-19 01:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
I thought this was Friday?

[05-Dec-19 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
not for the comp

[05-Dec-19 01:21 PM] zatJUM#9924
ok thanks Alright

[05-Dec-19 01:21 PM] Alright#0419

git clone https://github.com/kmdlabs/komodo
cd StakedNotary
./start.sh

could you do this please

[05-Dec-19 01:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
So I can keep my blocknotify scripts for LABS?

[05-Dec-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419

[05-Dec-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419

[05-Dec-19 01:31 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
@LabsAssistant please run the following commands to update NN. We've added a new chain in preparation for the comp tomorrow. The new staking algo will activate at 12/05/2019 @ 7:32pm (UTC) (roughly +6 hours) on CFEKPOS1. I've distributed coins to segid0 address of anyone that has signed up for comp so far. If anyone else wants coins, either POW mine them or ask me. 

```
cd
rm -rf ~/komodo
git clone https://github.com/kmdlabs/komodo
cd StakedNotary
./start.sh
```

Please don't forget to sign up for the comp. ( https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/e5zvki/kmdlabs_is_holding_a_bughunting_contest_on_friday/ ) If we don't get much interest(only 5 people so far), we may have to push it back.

I am remote at the moment - so spinning up a new VM is difficult (for contest) I may get to it in time for tomorrow, or maybe not.

[05-Dec-19 01:35 PM] Alright#0419
Not a huge deal if it needs to be pushed back a couple days, just sooner the better

[05-Dec-19 01:35 PM] Alright#0419
if we don't come close to 20 participants, may as well push it back and just test amongst ourselves for a few days
