Would anyone be willing to walk a fairly new Linux user through setting up the staking process for the contest?

[05-Dec-19 09:52 PM] Alright#0419
Sure, have you built komodod before?

[05-Dec-19 09:52 PM] Alright#0419

[05-Dec-19 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
Have you got a linux machine setup?

[05-Dec-19 09:55 PM] calrb#0451
Yes I do. I‚Äôm running Linux mint distro on a laptop

[05-Dec-19 09:56 PM] calrb#0451
I went to the github and where it says ‚Äúclone or download‚Äù I downloaded the file and extracted it

[05-Dec-19 09:57 PM] calrb#0451
But I‚Äôm sensing that wasn‚Äôt necessary? Lol

lmk when you get that far

[05-Dec-19 09:58 PM] calrb#0451
So I can just copy and paste that into the command line?

[05-Dec-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
after that do 
```
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

if you follow guide line by line and nothing else, the only thing you'll be winning is a bit of knowledge

glad to help anyone for the next couple hours, just ping me here

[05-Dec-19 10:07 PM] calrb#0451
@Alright I'm trying my best to actually take in what I'm doing. Learning how to use the command line in linux has been challenging for me

[05-Dec-19 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
No worries, takes a long while, was a noob myself not too long ago

[05-Dec-19 10:10 PM] calrb#0451
@Alright So, after running the second line of code I get this message:

[05-Dec-19 10:10 PM] calrb#0451
autoconf: error: invalid number of arguments

[05-Dec-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
what is the "second line"

[05-Dec-19 10:10 PM] calrb#0451
autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget

[05-Dec-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419

this is a single line

[05-Dec-19 10:11 PM] calrb#0451
Gotcha. I'll start over

[05-Dec-19 10:11 PM] calrb#0451

[05-Dec-19 10:16 PM] calrb#0451
K when I run this: ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc) It comes back with "No file or Directory"

[05-Dec-19 10:18 PM] dude#6062
those should be two seperate cmds

[05-Dec-19 10:19 PM] dude#6062
make sure u in the 'kmdlabs' folder

[05-Dec-19 10:20 PM] dude#6062
in a single line.... `cd ~ && cd kmdlabs && ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh && ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`

[05-Dec-19 10:22 PM] calrb#0451
@dude thank you for the help. It is worked... I wasn‚Äôt in the kmdlabs folder

[05-Dec-19 10:22 PM] dude#6062
cool

[05-Dec-19 11:00 PM] dude#6062
anyone know what the ac params for the test will be... need to get addresses generated..

[05-Dec-19 11:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
params don't matter for addresses

[05-Dec-19 11:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
address/key pairs carry to most every chain

[05-Dec-19 11:05 PM] dude#6062
yeah, this is a new box, didn't want to necessarily load kmd main chain just to gen addresses

[05-Dec-19 11:05 PM] Alright#0419
```
./komodod -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=222 -ac_reward=100000000000 -ac_staked=90 -ac_notarypay=1000000000 -ac_perc=1000000 -ac_pubkey=026f6ad5601c0e546a52fc202cb390d3f408a777527704694c0b09f4790d7bff3f -ac_founders=10 -addnode=80.240.17.222```

[05-Dec-19 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
that chain is running, is very similar to what the test will be

[05-Dec-19 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
has the new algo activated already

[05-Dec-19 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
Did you try to follow the instructions? That `entercomp.py` script will start a dummy daemon, generate addresses then kill the dummy daemon

[05-Dec-19 11:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`didn't want to necessarily load kmd main chain just to gen addresses`
you don't have to, that's what I'm saying
you could run `komodod -ac_name=JUSTFORKEYS`, gen the keys on an empty chain, and import them to any/every chain at a later date

[05-Dec-19 11:08 PM] dude#6062
gotcha, no i didn't got he route of using pos64staker - trying it from scratch

[05-Dec-19 11:08 PM] dude#6062
but the dummy one would work
