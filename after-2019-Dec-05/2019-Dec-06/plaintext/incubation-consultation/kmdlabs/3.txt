[05-Dec-19 02:51 PM] daemonfox#6136

[05-Dec-19 02:51 PM] Oszy#5734
`./asset-cli CFEKPOS1 addnode 45.32.157.216 add`
worked for me

[05-Dec-19 02:52 PM] Oszy#5734
with dash it's obviously method not found 😉

[05-Dec-19 02:52 PM] daemonfox#6136

[05-Dec-19 02:58 PM] Alright#0419
addnode via cli is a bit wonky sometimes

[05-Dec-19 02:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
it was notarizing and PoW mining to 1 that was bothering me

[05-Dec-19 03:01 PM] SHossain#0007

if you're going to sign up for comp, please do it ASAP or at least say here that you plan to

[05-Dec-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
trying to decide whether or not to push it back

[05-Dec-19 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll participate.

[05-Dec-19 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007

@spousesofblockchain

[05-Dec-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I will, still trying to catch up from the mess I made yesterday sorting out my $PATH issue

[05-Dec-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
i will but i dont have time to spin up a new node yet

[05-Dec-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
has to wait till this afternoon IRL work is calling

[05-Dec-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"work"? who does that anymore? 😕

[05-Dec-19 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
i do still im young and sadly...

[05-Dec-19 03:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
I didnt manage my 4400 BTCD properly or I wouldnt WORK

[05-Dec-19 03:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
id have been retired since dec 2017

[05-Dec-19 03:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
4400 BTCD X ~50 KMD =  220000 KMD in the swap. At $12 peak = $2.6M USD sadface

[05-Dec-19 03:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_never had any BTCD_

[05-Dec-19 03:21 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm up and running. First try, no dramas.
Waiting on a nota and 💤

[05-Dec-19 03:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
```ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host```after `dist-upgrade` and `reboot` 😩

[05-Dec-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
Think it's best to push this back to Sunday Noon UTC. We can get a mention included in the weekly KMD newsletter going out tomorrow if we just wait

[05-Dec-19 03:27 PM] CMaurice#1685
had all the cpus pegged and fans whirring at the pos64 build, but up and running fine

[05-Dec-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
Yep, calling it, pushed back to Sunday Noon UTC, just makes the most sense

[05-Dec-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
if we have issues with CFEKPOS1, we'll have plenty of time to fix and test

[05-Dec-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
and we should get plenty of new participants from newsletter mention

[05-Dec-19 03:31 PM] Alright#0419
All good? Not a bad time for anyone?

[05-Dec-19 03:32 PM] Oszy#5734
nah it's good

[05-Dec-19 03:35 PM] CMaurice#1685
yep, fine

[05-Dec-19 03:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
rebuilding...

[05-Dec-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Sunday Noon UTC`
because, sure, I have nothing better to do @ 6am on a Sunday

[05-Dec-19 04:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
right... iwas thinking the same thing for the Friday time... I had to be up by 6 AM to be prepped for 7 AM ET

[05-Dec-19 04:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
so  ican start IRL work by 8

[05-Dec-19 04:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
at least Sunday I can spend the day

[05-Dec-19 04:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
guess i have to be sober on sunday? 😒

[05-Dec-19 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what's this "sober" thing of which you speak?

[05-Dec-19 04:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
No "reputable" pirate would crypto sober

[05-Dec-19 04:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
who is this imposter?!?

[05-Dec-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
im PoW mining

[05-Dec-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
to help move the chain along

[05-Dec-19 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why always silly rewards?

[05-Dec-19 04:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
why not when its just a test chain?

or whatever you named it 🙂

[05-Dec-19 05:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
`cd pos64staker` that would help

where is your pos64staker repo cloned?

staketest$

[05-Dec-19 05:37 PM] Oszy#5734
doesn't look like it

[05-Dec-19 05:37 PM] Oszy#5734
it should be a folder called pos64staker

[05-Dec-19 05:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
didnt want to overwrite my other pos64staker

[05-Dec-19 05:38 PM] Oszy#5734
