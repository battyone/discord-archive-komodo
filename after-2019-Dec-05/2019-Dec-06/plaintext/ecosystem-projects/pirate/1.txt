[05-Dec-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> rpc api often timeout

[05-Dec-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Oszy> you can increase `rpcclienttimeout` in config

[05-Dec-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Oszy> set it high or  zero means no timeout.

[05-Dec-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> api result return very slowly

[05-Dec-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> it doesnt matter

[05-Dec-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> ?

[05-Dec-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Oszy> if wallet is big it's normal

[05-Dec-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <lc123456> ok  tks

[05-Dec-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> `z_mergetoaddress ["ANY_SAPLING"] <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>`
ANY_SAPLING is literal: do not change it.`
This can reduce the size of your wallet...

[05-Dec-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Which will speed up the general operations of the wallet and reduce RPC timeouts.

[05-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i think the wallet stores all transactions it has ever seen, so merging will speed up processing but the size likely wont be reduced

[05-Dec-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> you could make a brand new wallet, make a brand new address and then send to that address

[05-Dec-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> then the new wallet will indeed be very very small and efficient

[05-Dec-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Sup

[05-Dec-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @lc123456 try doing a `git pull` and rebuild now

[05-Dec-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <0786> @mrlynch its not possible to request rpc calls on lite wallet right?

[05-Dec-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> if you want rpc calls use full node

[05-Dec-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> lite wallet is just a "frontend" sort of speak that issues grpc calls to a light daemon (sort of electrum, but not electrum)

[05-Dec-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Rich> How does this affect pirate?

[05-Dec-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> laws impact exchanges, not decentralized currencies

[05-Dec-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> some currencies work with exchanges to be compliant to some random government/agency

[05-Dec-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I pray we are never intentionally among those

[05-Dec-19 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> yep, I hope we will stay strong, private and decentralized

[05-Dec-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> let exchanges and services bow to regulations if they want / have to

[05-Dec-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Rich> so the real onramp to pirate is contributing by mining

[05-Dec-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> the real "onramp" is just using it
