Hi,
I am a Cointelegraph journalist looking to ask some somewhat technical questions concerning the AtomicDEX platform.
Is there anyone that I can contact to get an official response?

@AngelInHell I tagged Audo for you, but you should search the different channels if you would like to speak to team members, developers, and community members. This channel is mostly for new members to verify in and the bot to keep spam out. 
Try #komodo-team  or #talk-general

You can also try #atomicdex-beta
