I could show you how to manually fix it if you like, but the dev of that project will need to update something

@lc123456 I can show you how to manually edit the code, so it will work, or you can wait until the devs update it

[05-Dec-19 12:16 PM] lc123456#5516
When can they handle it

[05-Dec-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
don't know ask them

[05-Dec-19 12:17 PM] lc123456#5516
maybe wait them is better

[05-Dec-19 12:18 PM] lc123456#5516
how to tell them has problem

[05-Dec-19 12:18 PM] Oszy#5734
will be done shortly

[05-Dec-19 12:18 PM] mrlynch#5735

@mrlynch

[05-Dec-19 12:20 PM] lc123456#5516
can you optimize it.

[05-Dec-19 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@lc123456 you will find I fixed this in Hush already 😉

Hush loves everyone
```Especially CG```

[05-Dec-19 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's because @lc123456 is adding both Pirate and Hush to an exchange and so he didn't run into this problem with Hush, and I was making a joke about that @Oszy

[05-Dec-19 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
now we can kick the dead horse of a joke some more

[05-Dec-19 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Oszy maybe it's unclear that KMD, Pirate and Hush all use that same libgmp code and so I was making a gentle joke amongst friends about having fixed the bug. Maybe that is not clear as you don't work on that part of the code

[05-Dec-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Privatoshi can't love me too much since I was banned over pointing out that duke's previous HUSH "fix" (which was just a dir change on the host) came **after** ca333's PR to komodo
**exactly** like this (where the HUSH "fix" of forking a a repo no one will likely support was a day *after* the Komodo commit to the gnu host)

[05-Dec-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some folks just need to feel validated, I guess 🤷🏽‍♂️

[05-Dec-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
If Pirate needs help solving the problem, they are welcome to use Hush's libgmp mirror on Github: https://github.com/MyHush/libgmp/releases

play nice

[05-Dec-19 05:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
pirate is using official libgmp mirror

[05-Dec-19 11:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
Hush decided to have a stable URL instead
