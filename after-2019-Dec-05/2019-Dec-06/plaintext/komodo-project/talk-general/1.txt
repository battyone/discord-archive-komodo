does anybody know this KMD address: RLJhbCkEQf9sQvfrCg2kiwgmousP9VMFB8? Get some coins and don't know why ...

maybe from notary election revshare?

[05-Dec-19 10:34 AM] OrgiOrg#1001

@OrgiOrg is that address yours?

your question just raises so many questions 游땟

he's asking why someone sent him KMD I believe

[05-Dec-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
which raises the questions:
why monitor an empty address?
why split this "don't know why" amount into many, many vouts (most of which don't collect rewards)?
etc...

[05-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
He got it from that addy

[05-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which is the one madmax prolly used for revshares

[05-Dec-19 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
