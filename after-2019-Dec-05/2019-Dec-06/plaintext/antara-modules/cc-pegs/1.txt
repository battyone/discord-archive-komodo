@NNoperator ^^

[05-Dec-19 06:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c The time slots for signing works like a charm. I moved them to 2 seconds as I had problems with 1 second.And I have made 3 withdraws in same block, they have been processed one by one without problem.

[05-Dec-19 07:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain You can try multiple withdraw now!

[05-Dec-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
what is multiple withdraw?

[05-Dec-19 07:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ah, nothins special. Creating withdrwas in same block and to see if they are going to be processed one by one.

[05-Dec-19 07:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
As withdraws at the same time cannot be done, because of utxos that are not spent until sign i completed. But that could also be optimized...

[05-Dec-19 07:26 PM] Alright#0419
Ah I see the issue there

[05-Dec-19 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
had a thought last night about withdraws. Have you considered just how large of a tx there will be with 15 sigs?

[05-Dec-19 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
or 13, whatever it is

[05-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Alright#0419
on BTC, that might be a pretty significant fee

[05-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well yes, it will be more fee. But it wont be 13, it will be 7 (7of13)

[05-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
But still larger than regular tx.

[05-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Alright#0419
does the gateway consolidate utxos at all?

[05-Dec-19 07:29 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll compile latest and try now

[05-Dec-19 07:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
It was, but I removed it recently as it was making a problem. But as there will be rewards claiming for KMD external chain, that process will consolidate utxos.

[05-Dec-19 07:29 PM] Alright#0419
let's say there are 10 BTC utxos in the gateway, combining these 10 for a withdraw with 7 sigs for each will create a massive tx

[05-Dec-19 07:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, definitely it will be some higher fee with big txs.

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c BTW, initially txfee was hardcoded to 20k sats for BTC I think. We should see how this should change overtime if at some point txfees rise, we would not get the tx confirmed long time if it is lower fee.

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
We should definitely first use txfee per byte

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
correct, maybe use the BTC adaptive fee estimator

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
But then if fee is high we should be able to adjust it

[05-Dec-19 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i forget what it is called, they keep changing the rpc calls

[05-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, so there is some rpc. I'll check it out

[05-Dec-19 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it used to be estimatefee

[05-Dec-19 07:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
`estimatesmartfee`

[05-Dec-19 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007

[05-Dec-19 07:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm mining only with one node so blocks come slowly

[05-Dec-19 07:46 PM] Mihailo#5902

[05-Dec-19 07:57 PM] Mihailo#5902

[05-Dec-19 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007

[05-Dec-19 07:57 PM] Mihailo#5902
when I said processed, I meant on MBTCTEST, so you need o wait for it to be mined on KMD

[05-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Mihailo#5902
I had this problems!

[05-Dec-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
`adaptivepow` is for different issues. when large ASIC mines for a bit, diff goes high and they leave

[05-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Mihailo#5902
I thought it was because some of txs stayed on mempool on nodes where I had some problems before

[05-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, new block

[05-Dec-19 08:07 PM] SHossain#0007

[05-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
or use getunconfirmedbalance

[05-Dec-19 08:09 PM] SHossain#0007
after this i'll do another batch

[05-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok

[05-Dec-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
but, `getunconfirmedbalance` shows only unconfirmed which might be beneficial for GUIs if they don't use `getwalletinfo`

[05-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
BAsically, this problem with mining is also something that adaptive pow could fix maybe. The problem is that with low mining power, there is no block for some time, then the difficulty loweres, then few block comes and difficulty goes up.

[05-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c BTW, which DAA are we using now?

[05-Dec-19 08:11 PM] SHossain#0007
only you were mining. i wasn't. that might be the issue

[05-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
How it showed in zawys tests?

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, difficulty should be adjusted gradually so that there are no spikes.

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
with Zawy's test, it might take few mins for a block sometimes

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
we can test that on the next chain

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
all balances here. i'll issue another 3-4. please monitor

[05-Dec-19 08:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, then I will be AFK

[05-Dec-19 08:13 PM] SHossain#0007
strange. now, my miner didn't crash the daemon

[05-Dec-19 08:14 PM] SHossain#0007
and it mined the block

[05-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Mihailo#5902
Sometimes it crashes

[05-Dec-19 08:14 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll keep it running with `gdb` on the next tests to catch this bug

[05-Dec-19 08:15 PM] SHossain#0007
now it's great that we have parallel multiple withdraws working üôÇ

[05-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think the problem is that input is spent, but same thing with problem I had with tx staying in wallet and added to nodes mempool
