It would be faster, but I added 10 second delay so that KMD tx is propagated before siwtching to next, to not use same utxos

[05-Dec-19 08:20 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll issue few more withdraws

[05-Dec-19 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
did about 10 now

[05-Dec-19 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
before that i stopped mining

[05-Dec-19 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
started mining after issuing those withdraws, couldn't crash daemon

[05-Dec-19 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
they are being validated now

[05-Dec-19 08:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Someone could make a DoS attack by creating a lot of small withdraws and clog up the queue so nobody elses withdraw gets processed. Maybe a limit should be done, but for BTC and high valued coins it shouldn't be high!

[05-Dec-19 08:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain  no more funds to do withdraws!

[05-Dec-19 08:27 PM] SHossain#0007
we need a bash script to quickly withdraw 50 or 100 and broadcast them. would be faster to test than manual

[05-Dec-19 08:27 PM] SHossain#0007
@Mihailo you tagged someone else üòõ

i'll deposit more tonight

[05-Dec-19 08:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, this could also be a problem.

[05-Dec-19 08:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
Balance that is submitted into oracle comes every 10 seconds.

[05-Dec-19 08:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
And these withdraws can be processed before balance is submitted...

[05-Dec-19 08:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'll have to figure out something

[05-Dec-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
i still have balance in my MBTCTEST chain that i deposited
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MBTCTEST importgatewayaddress

  "result": "success",
  "ImportGatewayCCAddress": "RXJT6CRAXHFuQ2UjqdxMj7EfrayF6UJpzZ",

[05-Dec-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
who took ma money? :abused:

[05-Dec-19 08:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
But I think I have accounted the balance for created withdraws, so it shouldn't be...

[05-Dec-19 08:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
üòÑ

[05-Dec-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe the tx fees that were used for withdraws

[05-Dec-19 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, this is an issue

[05-Dec-19 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
actually a big one

[05-Dec-19 08:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
txfee is currently 10k but I think I tested it with 1k so I can lower it. And marker fee is lowered to 1k. So 11k goes per withdraw

[05-Dec-19 08:31 PM] Alright#0419
these chains are going to need APOW

[05-Dec-19 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, we will get apow.

[05-Dec-19 08:31 PM] Alright#0419
need some way to keep blocks moving without stalling with no incentive to mine

[05-Dec-19 08:32 PM] Alright#0419
might be better to only allow signers to produce blocks? These chains aren't likely to have much hashrate and will be subject to censorship attacks

[05-Dec-19 08:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
dPoW and aPoW is a must I think

[05-Dec-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[05-Dec-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
all chains will have dPoW and aPoW

[05-Dec-19 08:33 PM] Alright#0419
apow with little hashrate still vuln to censorship

[05-Dec-19 08:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
@Alright what is censorship attack?

[05-Dec-19 08:34 PM] Alright#0419
mine every block with no transactions

[05-Dec-19 08:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
Aha, so the miner is set not to add txs?

[05-Dec-19 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
yes and reorg any blocks that do

[05-Dec-19 08:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, and how other chains fight with this?

[05-Dec-19 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
hashrate or pos

[05-Dec-19 08:36 PM] Mihailo#5902
aha, ok so every chain with low hashrate has this problem?

[05-Dec-19 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
yes, it requires like 150% of hashrate

[05-Dec-19 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
but with a CPU mined chain, that is nothing

[05-Dec-19 08:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
üëç

[05-Dec-19 08:37 PM] SHossain#0007
then, leave the mining only to those 13 nodes

[05-Dec-19 08:38 PM] SHossain#0007
and, for dPoW, we have 64 nodes of KMD mainnet

[05-Dec-19 08:38 PM] SHossain#0007
guess, they could also mine the chain, if there is value

[05-Dec-19 08:39 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm just typing raw ideas as suggestion

[05-Dec-19 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
I'll mine the BTC chain any day üòÇ

[05-Dec-19 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
don't touch default tx fees

[05-Dec-19 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
ü§£

[05-Dec-19 08:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
I have rebooted the nodes so that they start everything in background

[05-Dec-19 08:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm going to have some sleep. Will continue tomorrow.

[05-Dec-19 08:40 PM] SHossain#0007
cool

[05-Dec-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
Just realized that notarization tx will need to be tweaked for the BTC chain at least

[05-Dec-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright then, we can just limit those mining only to 13 msig-signers. they have to run default original source-code anyway since there is no race at the moment.

[05-Dec-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
would be paying just as much as we do to notarize to BTC

[05-Dec-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c ^

[05-Dec-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
not planning to run BTC backed chain

[05-Dec-19 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
just KMD?

[05-Dec-19 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
tbh that's a bit disappointing, was looking forward to that

[05-Dec-19 08:46 PM] phm87#7395
I was also waiting for BTC baked chain

What if I told you you can download an app off the app store and send BTC using Confidential Transactions /right now/ using a wallet that can run over Tor?

I don t like liquid. I hope the same on kmd

[05-Dec-19 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
nothing stopping us from organizing it @phm87

[05-Dec-19 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
well other than what I just mentioned

[05-Dec-19 08:49 PM] phm87#7395
Ok. I still have things in my to do list (finish apow tests on chips, secret project on mm2 ...) but I agree to look at this after. Thank you alright

[05-Dec-19 09:16 PM] SHossain#0007
i used `0.00000100` as market amount and it worked last time. doing the same with a new deposit

[05-Dec-19 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007

just `sendrawtransaction` shows the error above

[05-Dec-19 10:06 PM] SHossain#0007
`bad-txns-opret-too-big`
i wonder if that has anything to do with the original KMD tx which included a lot of utxos

[05-Dec-19 10:06 PM] SHossain#0007
24 utxos to be exact

[05-Dec-19 10:07 PM] SHossain#0007
https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/80c934e2c96f7d941f9652449ef34dddd78f71409460139f61a0a18fb9295005

[05-Dec-19 10:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, it has.

[05-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
Because we are puting raw hex in AC tx an proof it gets wuite huge and probably over 10k limit

[05-Dec-19 11:54 PM] SHossain#0007
would that be hard or bad to increase that limit? i guess we need a way to import that type of deposits. some user might use more utxos than me.
