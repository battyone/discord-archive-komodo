>>> @molab If those transfers out of your wallet have not been done by yourself your address is compromised, so I suggest these actions:
1) Stop all transfers to this address (change mining / payout address as soon as possible)
2) Transfer all funds in this wallet to a newly created different wallet on another system (like Verus Mobile).
3) Remove this wallet and the wallet software from your system.
4) Check your system thoroughly on malware (which is a likely cause of that address being compromised). Use consequtive sweeps with different Malware / AntiVirus / Rootkit scanners.
5) If you are convinced your system is clean, reinstall Agama to create a new (uncompromised) wallet.
6) Transfer funds to your new wallet and adjust mining addresses to it.
7) make regular backups of your `wallet.dat` and/or WIFs to a secure, off-line device.";"";"👆 (1)";

"636471835642429450";"Arno#3334";"05-Dec-19 09:31 AM";"What's the derivation path of Agama Wallet addresses? The problem is that when you enter the same 24 word seed into Agama and bip39 tools, different KMD addresses are derived. The path of the bip39 tools is m/44'/141'/0'/0/0. So what's the path of Agama? Just want to make sure to be safe just with the seed even without Agama, but if I use Agama's addresses, I cannot find them anymore with bip39 tools, which feels dangerous to me.";"";"";
"423176312354635779";"gcharang#6833";"05-Dec-19 09:42 AM";"Agama address generation doesn't follow bip39
it is something unique for the komodo ecosystem

even if agama wasn't available, all the other wallets in komodo ecosystem support the passphrase

it is even baked into the komodo core daemon itself
```
./komodo-cli help convertpassphrase                                                                                                  

convertpassphrase ""agamapassphrase""

Converts Agama passphrase to a private key and WIF (for import with importprivkey).

Arguments:
1. ""agamapassphrase""   (string, required) Agama passphrase

Result:
""agamapassphrase"": ""agamapassphrase"",   (string) Agama passphrase you entered
""address"": ""komodoaddress"",             (string) Address corresponding to your passphrase
""pubkey"": ""publickeyhex"",               (string) The hex value of the raw public key
""privkey"": ""privatekeyhex"",             (string) The hex value of the raw private key
""wif"": ""wif""                            (string) The private key in WIF format to use with 'importprivkey'

Examples:
> komodo-cli  convertpassphrase ""agamapassphrase""
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{""jsonrpc"": ""1.0"", ""id"":""curltest"", ""method"": ""convertpassphrase"", ""params"": [""agamapassphrase""] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
