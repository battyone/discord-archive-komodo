Maybe it is trying to build the qt version of komodo after building komodod and komodo-cli. A server without graphical interface will  have difficulties to build the qt (GUI version)
If you want, some binaries are available (but it is better to build from source).
About zcash, I don't understand, maybe it is new or something else. Some parameters should be downloaded before running it but","",""

You will need at least 4GB of RAM to build hush from git source, OR you can enable a swap file. To enable a 4GB swap file on modern Linux distributions:

sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile```
