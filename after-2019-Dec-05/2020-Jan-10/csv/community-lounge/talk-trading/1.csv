Since Komodo is billing itself as a platform, more of a focus should be on that. There is much talk here about the price, and what it's going to do, and how to advertise this to other traders. This would suggest that Komodo is simply thought of as a coin. The focus is NOT on being a coin, but a platform. As such any marketing towards being a coin is going to fall flat. Marketing and thought of Komodo needs to be hyper-focused on being a platform. Maybe a monthly hackathon with prize money put up by the community would satisfy marketing and new user acquisition all in one swoop, or something like that.

We have two universities that already worked with; with 2 professors and 2 groups of students. In two countries and languages. This sounds like the right recipe for developing a standardized university pitch. What was the details regarding the scholarship/grants? Was it positive? Where did the funds come from? Are more of these grants available?  And finally, how about running a bounty or refferal bonus for anyone that can get a university to work/develop with komodo. Do you just want anyone to pitch to a University or would you pay a finder's fee for a success?","",""
