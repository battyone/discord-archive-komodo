...and people wonder why so many ask if KMD is a staking coin

[09-Jan-20 05:29 AM] Bitfinger#6245
You guys really think the atomicwallet team doesn't know better? Don't be so naive.

[09-Jan-20 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
less effort to market it as staking rewards by them then to have to explain to everyone that the rewards are actually on chain and not from staking nodes

[09-Jan-20 09:09 AM] Oszy#5734
must be very complicated to say `rewards` you have to claim manually every month
most of the people doesn't even know what staking is, all they see is, `have the coin, do nothing to get more coins`

if you can talk to them like fucking toddlers without having to explain to much, you do well at marketing :p

[09-Jan-20 10:21 AM] Tom.T#6920
The rewards like buy back. You don‚Äôt move your Kmd so you can get kmd as rewards :2561_feelsevilman:

[09-Jan-20 10:23 AM] Tom.T#6920
Staking is just one node can get the block reward, right?:2561_feelsevilman:

[09-Jan-20 10:41 AM] Oszy#5734
yes

I'm sad, I feel like good komodo ecosystem/community projects often die. Just learned barterlly and hyperdex are in purgatory:(

they might die but there's always something new / better taking their place üôÇ

[09-Jan-20 06:11 PM] steinsg8#0288
But I feel people worked so hard on some project. For example, who knows how long heatledger has been trying to make something üòÇ

[09-Jan-20 06:11 PM] steinsg8#0288
Idk if anyone even remembers them anymore

[09-Jan-20 06:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
But if nothing in the KMD system ‚Äústicks‚Äù or succeeds... how long can that go on before the ecosystem is irrelevant?  And what would a 100% project failure rate suggest about KMD as a whole?  We need something that works.

[09-Jan-20 06:16 PM] denio#8067
100% project failure rate? Maybe we are in two different KMD systems... Or can you explain what is 100% failure rate for you?

[09-Jan-20 06:20 PM] steinsg8#0288
I dont agree with 100%; however, probably 80% of ecosystem projects have died. Sure, most crypto projects die in general. But to die without being give a shot? Idk, I feel some of the projects are like this. Marketing very had for some of these projects.

[09-Jan-20 06:28 PM] denio#8067
well, i dont know how big or small this rate is in reality. But i see a bunch of everyday hard working projects here. And i aggree that a few  projects quits/disappears. But maybe you have to check your expectant attitude. We speak about start-ups (if you want to compare it to companies), and start ups have a high rate of failing. I am everyday impressed, what some kmd ecosystems projects do, without any kind of "real" funding!

[09-Jan-20 06:30 PM] denio#8067
so in terms of "i want to be a millionare asap" you are right. But in terms of tech evolution the truth cannot be further away then your statements.

[09-Jan-20 06:32 PM] steinsg8#0288
I'm just upset that it seems to come down to marketing @denio

[09-Jan-20 06:32 PM] steinsg8#0288
Great tech, no marketing. Then the project just slowly dies :(

[09-Jan-20 06:32 PM] steinsg8#0288
I shouldn't say no marketing, perhaps I mean adoption or interest.

[09-Jan-20 06:32 PM] steinsg8#0288
The market is just too saturated.

[09-Jan-20 06:34 PM] denio#8067
Yes its frustrating, i aggree. The better the tech the worser the price it seems. But show me one Blockchain project (maybe beside BTC) with adoption.

[09-Jan-20 06:34 PM] denio#8067
I will buy blind if you find one

[09-Jan-20 06:34 PM] steinsg8#0288
Hahaha, good point.

[09-Jan-20 06:35 PM] denio#8067
The whole Blockchain space is speculation driven, not adoption driven in my opinion

[09-Jan-20 06:35 PM] steinsg8#0288
Yes, maybe 85% speculation. Very sad :(

[09-Jan-20 06:36 PM] denio#8067
i think this will change in the future.It will take time. Maybe we are death before, but thats why i am here. Which ecoystem has so many possible ways for adoption?

[09-Jan-20 06:37 PM] denio#8067
Which has so many volunteers? So many people workin for free on future tech

[09-Jan-20 06:37 PM] steinsg8#0288
True true true

[09-Jan-20 06:37 PM] steinsg8#0288
I actually love komodo

[09-Jan-20 06:37 PM] steinsg8#0288
I'm just crushed to see some great projects die

[09-Jan-20 06:37 PM] denio#8067
i can aggree on that

[09-Jan-20 06:37 PM] steinsg8#0288
But I guess survival of the fittest is a thing

What is the successful KMD ecosystem project?  Like, the premier success story?  One that will really make my nipples hard. Hit me with it.

[09-Jan-20 08:04 PM] steinsg8#0288
I think DEX will be the magnum opus. It isn't there yet tho. I wonder if there are any others.

[09-Jan-20 08:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
That‚Äôs right, it isn‚Äôt there yet so it‚Äôs a big ‚Äúif‚Äù.   And from what I have heard it is a long way from graduating out of beta.  Maybe @denio has a project in mind that would be considered functional and a success...?  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want there to be many success stories. I just don‚Äôt think there are any high profile ones.

[09-Jan-20 08:24 PM] phm87#7395
With some marketing, Labs can be more used/known than trezarcoin. Technically, tzc is very bad compared to labs. Sad that there is nearly no marketing

[09-Jan-20 08:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
Which sort of begs the question, if KMD truly is a superior platform, then why aren‚Äôt developers from other ecosystems migrating over?  Why are clearly intelligent devs with successful projects not seeing what seems so obvious to the KMD chorus in here?  I guess they are just idiots...?

[09-Jan-20 08:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
@phm87 so your example of a successful project is an incubator/testing arena for KMD projects?  Labs is described as ‚ÄúA fully scalable and customizable test bed for testing and developing your Komodo (KMD) based assetchains and Crypto-Conditions contracts, KMDLabs provides an incentivized test network, technical services and a support knowledge base.‚Äù

[09-Jan-20 08:28 PM] phm87#7395
I was thinking about staking. Tzc is successfull because ppl stake it. Labs is way better

[09-Jan-20 08:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
If LABS were successful, it seems by definition, that would mean there are successful KMD projects out there.

[09-Jan-20 08:28 PM] phm87#7395
Once per 6 months, whole network of tzc crashes, including explorers.

[09-Jan-20 08:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ok. But that is totally irrelevant to my question and what we are discussing.

[09-Jan-20 08:29 PM] phm87#7395
I think that marketing is not enough strong. I think that labs is better than tzc but without communication, I can t convince ppl to stop tzc

[09-Jan-20 08:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
I agree that marketing is not good.

[09-Jan-20 08:30 PM] phm87#7395
@meatspoon I don t agree. Absence of marketing is the root cause of the pb

[09-Jan-20 08:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am not saying it‚Äôs a root cause.

[09-Jan-20 08:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am just saying it‚Äôs not good.

[09-Jan-20 08:31 PM] phm87#7395
I had very bad coins on my pool with huge marketing (xvg as example). Coin is full of bugs but price is high. Huge marketing based on lies for xvg

[09-Jan-20 08:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am totally rooting for someone to give a good example. I am not familiar with every single KMD project, so maybe there is something out there that is actually a success. But no one can give an example.

[09-Jan-20 08:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
But I keep circling back to that question... why are no quality projects migrating if KMD is sooooooo much better?

[09-Jan-20 08:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
Why is the industry not recognizing KMD superiority?

[09-Jan-20 08:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yet there are other successful, active, non-scam projects in other ecosystems. Is there anyone on the KMD team actively contacting these other projects and trying to sell them on the benefits of migrating?  If so, what are the reasons given by said devs for declining the invitation?

[09-Jan-20 08:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Most projects don‚Äôt need a full chain or if they do aren‚Äôt in the position to transition , either due to cost, lack of tech personnel .

[09-Jan-20 08:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The grand irony of Komodo is that if we would have just continued the Token model we had on NXT more adoption would be taking place.  However single-chain model doesn‚Äôt work in the long run for numerous reasons

[09-Jan-20 09:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
The projects I am thinking of don‚Äôt seem like they are short on tech personnel, nor funding.  Maybe they are, but that would be surprising.

[09-Jan-20 09:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Which projects built on others do you have in mind

[09-Jan-20 09:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
Then again, I would imagine these projects‚Äô legal departments would shit a brick at the idea of moving off of Ethereum (which is not a security) and onto a network that has no clarity from the SEC.

[09-Jan-20 09:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
BAT, Golem, Storj, etc. or even exchanges that use ETH stable coins.

[09-Jan-20 09:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
Like Gemini

[09-Jan-20 09:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
In our system they would have their own chain,  no legal issues inherited from Komodo.     It‚Äôs clear why they chose to build on Eth ,  lack of development costs.   The cost of fees in the short term is less than the cost of maintaining your own network .  In the long term this switches.   The brand recognition of Eth and the outpouring of investment money from the Eth community is another reason.   But as we have seen this model is only sustainable at a low Eth price and low usage.

[09-Jan-20 09:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
Good answer. But if they can scale....

[09-Jan-20 09:17 PM] phm87#7395
I heard that more projects are built on Liquid, maybe Liquid can be another competitor (I don't like liquid)

[09-Jan-20 09:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
And right now do they need to scale?  We are still so early in the game. They might have plenty of time to figure it out. Then there would be less reason to migrate.

[09-Jan-20 09:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes they need to scale.  Eth is at 1 TB hard drive space ,  DAG is encroaching Ram size of consumer grade GPU‚Äôs .  Slows downs to a halt and becomes really expensive even with one actively used dapp

[09-Jan-20 09:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Sands of that hourglass are dripping.  And Eth 2.0 isn‚Äôt coming for several years

[09-Jan-20 09:24 PM] phm87#7395
9 teams were working on 9 different solutions to scale eth, I didn't follow details. I think that the last eth update (constantinople ?) was related to that but I heard that a big part of eth projects won't be able to move to a shard

[09-Jan-20 09:28 PM] phm87#7395
it can be an important moment for KMD ecosystem: eth projects can move to a shard (if possible), migrate to liquid or a KMD assetchain. At next Bubble, projects still on the eth chain will suffer due to gas price and gas amounts needed. But KMD is tiny compared to blockstream and ethereum

[09-Jan-20 09:33 PM] phm87#7395
Personally, I think that AtomicDEX can be a game changer. Few DEX exist and their volumes are tiny so when coming out of beta, AtomicDEX can take a big part of the market easily.
Many will disagree with the following : There is a subset of DEX, the DEX on second layers (LN and liquid are second layers of BTC, shards of eth will be "soon" second layer of eth). I found less than 5 DEX with LN (or another second layer if any). If LN is added, AtomicDEX will be the biggest DEX with LN on hearth (number of coins). I have a secret plan

@meatspoon crypto / dpow work fine and it's unique, the problem is that many crypto users don't know the importance of their chains being safe.

[09-Jan-20 11:36 PM] costa2439#3771
when I have shown people komodo, the notary nodes seem to them centralization, that can be a problem
