> Win security message saying chrome wants me to log into github for some reason
Is it really a windows security message? I haven't used windows recently, but I don't think windows OS will ask you about this.

it still asked me to allow the connection to the device, which never happened before the last update to the latest firmware. must be that then.

actually it was a windows security message saying chrome asked for log-in to github, and then that the device was unavailable

> asked me to allow the connection to the device

yep, if the swap is ongoing then you'd usually wait till it succeeds or fails
