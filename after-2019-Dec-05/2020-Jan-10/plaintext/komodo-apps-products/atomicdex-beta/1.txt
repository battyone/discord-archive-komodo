is there a list of electrum servers somewhere? I would like to connect BUSD to my mm2 so i can check out orderbook, thanks!

https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums you can find list of electrums there, however BUSD is ERC20 so you need to specify swap smart contract and ETH node: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/ethereum/ETH
Swap contract address is `0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871`

Hi, is there a second stress test planed in next time?

[09-Jan-20 07:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  currently jl is working on developing decentralized order match engine.  After it‚Äôs ready it will be tested internally then another public stress test.  No hard dates yet but will be this year.  Work can be seen ongoing in #ask-jl777

so a little confused on connecting mm2 to an erc20 token (such as busd). 
The BTC based coins are easy I just copy one of the connect scripts to a newly named one, open it and change say for instance KMD to VRSC, save and run and i'm connected.
It looks like BUSD is listed in the coins file already, but it seems there is an additional file that I need to create in order to connect, what file and where do i put it?

[09-Jan-20 07:07 AM] CiPhEr#2091
for instance, this is already in my atomicDEX-API/target/debug/coins file:
  {
    "coin": "BUSD",
    "name": "binance-usd",
    "fname": "Binance USD",
    "etomic": "0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53",
    "rpcport": 80,
    "mm2": 1
  },

[09-Jan-20 07:14 AM] CiPhEr#2091
seems there might be an "Ethereum info file" required that starts out with "swap_contract_address":"0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871" would this address be the same for any erc20 token? Would this file be placed into my atomicDEX-API/target/debug/ folder?
I have no idea what I would put in the url / contact fields, all of this seems more like if I was applying to have a coin listed into adex?

not sure which scripts you are using, but this link might help

Thanks @polycryptoblog

[09-Jan-20 09:41 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Can I make a suggestion to update the github page at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX
I know there is a lot of work going on in the background but github looks a bit dead.
I suggest adding a bit of info in the readme and perhaps a link there to the playstore app.
Also if it's possible, you should be adding the release versions to the 'releases' tab, even if it is just links to the playstore. Perhaps adding what fixes/features etc. have been done.
I expect more serious people will be looking for info on github rather than playstore and at least they can see something is happening.

You could also consider uploading a silent mp3 to that page for users to download so you don't get so many 'noise complaints' üòâ

Thanks  @Oszy, I'd suggest a 30sec file which would be much smaller and also put it on github as I'd imagine most users would prefer to download from the 'official' source

[09-Jan-20 11:11 AM] Bitfinger#6245
That file doesn't seem to work for me  @Oszy, maybe it's too long or something. I still hear coins after choosing it for all sound events

[09-Jan-20 11:12 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Oh wait, that seems to be another sound for action confirmations or something... no sound during swap now üëç

[09-Jan-20 11:19 AM] Oszy#5734
I use this, just fine. ofc it could be shorter, there are loads of files like this online. 630kb is not big :p

[09-Jan-20 08:30 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I have 20Gb/month  @Oszy, every kb counts üòâ

[09-Jan-20 08:54 PM] CiPhEr#2091
I'm getting a bunch of 'swap failed' and 'timeout' today. Are there ways of tracking down the cause of these or are the reasons for either of these problems always the same? Maybe my work internet is terrible? Using android app, latest

[09-Jan-20 08:56 PM] CiPhEr#2091
I can provide uuids or logs if needed

[09-Jan-20 11:30 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
I've seen a number of failed swaps as well and I'm going to look closer into this by the end of the next week, as I'll be experimenting with failure gossip being implemented on top of komodod DEX p2p
