@Cryptoon KMD has funding to keep things going and not let the whole project just die, sure. I'm talking about actual funding required to move the project to a much larger scale - to the point where it all really matters

[09-Jan-20 12:35 AM] richardt#2807
So far, KMD is still like a tiny ant next to some of the other projects/communities out there

[09-Jan-20 12:37 AM] richardt#2807
Then again, probably useless to argue about something that likely won't happen (more funding)

[09-Jan-20 04:08 AM] jspook16#3059
I think we, as a KMD community, need to do more for exposure. Those are just the cards KMD was dealt. The tech doesn't lie though, kmd is capable of a lot. Just need to find people that want build on the platform.

[09-Jan-20 06:04 AM] Bitfinger#6245
You can't force people to 'spread the word', you just look like a bunch of alt coin shills. People need to want to talk about it to come across as genuine. Imo kmd needs a finished product to be taken seriously. Atomicdex needs to move quicker as Agama was 'given away' to another team. I know dev takes time, but this game moves quickly and other projects are moving quicker to get finished products out even if the tech is not what it says.

[09-Jan-20 06:06 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Also think about naming things better for marketing purposes... I.e. dPow could have been named rPow (recycled proof of work) and KMD could be rightly sold as a green coin recycling the 'wasted' electricity used in btc. Delayed just sounds slow.

TSLA doesn't spend money on advertisement and looks at it's price

i like rPoW

[09-Jan-20 06:16 AM] ph03nix#3115
delayed does have a negative connotation

[09-Jan-20 06:20 AM] ph03nix#3115
also, many people confuse it for delegated proof of work

[09-Jan-20 06:21 AM] Bitfinger#6245
That's the difference between advertising and brand building... if you build a 'cool' brand people feel 'cool' talking about it to their friends and advertising is free

great points

[09-Jan-20 08:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@richardt I think what you are referring to is funding to develop more projects? That type of funding will come from the likes of RedFoxlabs and other incubators that develop specific projects on demand for companies.

[09-Jan-20 08:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
KMD itself develops the general framework.

[09-Jan-20 08:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That way also funding needs are split between the people developping 'wordpress' and companies actually making the websites on demand for customers

[09-Jan-20 08:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
contrary to for example EOS I believe, that also has funding to fund specific projects

[09-Jan-20 08:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For ETH, main ETH devs are probably less in numbers compared to Consensys devs

[09-Jan-20 08:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And consensys is where main current funding goes to I believe

[09-Jan-20 09:15 AM] Flint#6435
@Bitfinger You are absolutely rightüëç . I subscribe to each of your words above! People need a ready-made and understandable project today to talk about the project tomorrow! Then advertising will not be needed when it is ‚Äúcool‚Äù not only in theory but also in my smartphone where you can trade anything and create assets yourself by blocking part of KMD, but for now I hear only the nasty sound of coins from the application and I‚Äôll endure as a devoted part of the community this sound but the new user who downloaded the application will delete it to hell

[09-Jan-20 09:20 AM] Flint#6435
@Cryptoon Yes, but we need a killer application today, at least one FULLY working to talk about the project outside of our community! Too many goals are wonderful goals and this is great, but let's not forget that we are not alone and live in a cruel world of competition where others ALREADY released working services from which it will then be difficult to lure people into Komodo because they will already have a working and debugged product.

[09-Jan-20 10:22 AM] Bitfinger#6245
I agree the sounds are irritating  @Flint, but the functionality is there to select your own, so it is a wip. Development is a frustrating game sometimes.

[09-Jan-20 11:28 AM] Markus#5464
@Gordon Komodo tesla doesnt need marketing, enough that elon musk speaks publicly thats enough marketing

[09-Jan-20 11:33 AM] Markus#5464
and elon musk values time, he make something new nobody rly put enough effort into making a reality and he get it out to the public as soon as possible, no time wasted

@Bitfinger KMD is so confusing, it took Ideas by Nature almost a year to design the new website üòÑ

[09-Jan-20 12:17 PM] richardt#2807
And I completely agree with you. Up to this point, the mentality has been "build the tech and they will come".  Well, it's been over two years.... there has to be some kind finished (out of beta) product/service that everyone could use in order for people to talk about

[09-Jan-20 12:18 PM] richardt#2807
Luckily for KMD, the DEX world is not full of competitors yet, but who knows, maybe soon there will be

[09-Jan-20 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think most of the efforts are going into atomicdex mobile/desktop...

[09-Jan-20 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And related plugins like marketmaker/LP/CEX Arbitrage bots etc

[09-Jan-20 12:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hopefully out of beta by Q2/Q3 to start blasting marketing/onboarding around it in full force

[09-Jan-20 12:29 PM] richardt#2807
That's good. That's where the focus really should right now since that'll be what gets more users in and provide more revenue for the team for further development

[09-Jan-20 02:02 PM] Markus#5464
dont think so that true atomic dex's gonna be a massive success, it will be great to trade anonymously without any some kind of limitation but the whales wont use it cause they cant have a edge manipulating the orderbook in matter of seconds

[09-Jan-20 02:03 PM] Markus#5464
but i can see a true dex being highly used to wash stolen crypto

[09-Jan-20 02:09 PM] TonyL#3577
You don‚Äôt control your privkeys in case of CEX usage, that‚Äôs the main point

[09-Jan-20 03:22 PM] richardt#2807
@Markus I somewhat agree. The user experience is what will hinder DEX the most. They're just inherently inefficient. But it's kinda the best bet at this point for bringing in users/revenue.

[09-Jan-20 03:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Imo, just as I see it, that similar to comparison of usual databases with blockchain: in any case usual DB will work faster but clue is in different paradigms and application scope is different for these two pieces of tech

[09-Jan-20 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
@TonyL The whole "not your keys. not your crypto" is way too hard core for the masses.  That sort of responsibility is only appealing to a tiny minority of people (for now).  KMD and crypto in general needs to kind of ditch that hard core attitude if it wants to be approachable by the masses.  Literally every single person who has that mentality is already into crypto...  the rest of the herd doesnt want their keys (yet).

[09-Jan-20 04:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
i think it ends up being counter productive when crypto owners repeat that mantra because it tends to build a barrier between us and "them" and we need "them" to get with the program if we want our moon mission.

[09-Jan-20 04:19 PM] joe2x4#5987
Great brainstorming ideas above. I especially like the idea of changing dpow to rpow. That is brilliant. 

Since Komodo is billing itself as a platform, more of a focus should be on that. There is much talk here about the price, and what it's going to do, and how to advertise this to other traders. This would suggest that Komodo is simply thought of as a coin. The focus is NOT on being a coin, but a platform. As such any marketing towards being a coin is going to fall flat. Marketing and thought of Komodo needs to be hyper-focused on being a platform. Maybe a monthly hackathon with prize money put up by the community would satisfy marketing and new user acquisition all in one swoop, or something like that.


2.The community here that are not devs do need something for us to do in order to help. Maybe there is some tasks for non devs.

Are there enough developer for monthly hackathon? ü§î

[09-Jan-20 04:45 PM] TonyL#3577
@meatspoon My main idea was that usual database trading (CEX) will never equal blockchain (DEX) trading experience because it‚Äôs different things same as usual database differ to blockchain. For sure I believe some more solutions for things speed up and make blockchain trading as user friendly as possible will be found for sure. And this mantra - not sure what barriers it‚Äôs creating for DEX, crypto is designed this way

[09-Jan-20 04:47 PM] TonyL#3577
What the point to trade on blockchain if you store account info in usual DB controlled by central party, right

[09-Jan-20 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
It‚Äôs not a point of DEXes marketing, just a fact. For DEX marketing something interesting and understandable for everyone is needed for sure

KMD in my buy zone... remember I said 52c...

[09-Jan-20 07:24 PM] joe2x4#5987
That would be the point. The platform needs to attract developers more so than traders.

[09-Jan-20 07:27 PM] Bitfinger#6245
To continue from above, I agree with Tony that DEX will not be the same as a CEX and it is a long way off from challenging them so I think we can bin that idea. What does attract me to Atomicdex is the fact that it's P2P which is how crypto should be and that alone should sell itself, not as a laundering machine or similar,but a real use case as a distributed P2P exchange.

[09-Jan-20 07:28 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Also, I doubt there will be any sweeping legislation to close all CEXs. The USSA just wants their piece of the pie through regulation as we see already there are various exchanges operating there legally now.

[09-Jan-20 07:35 PM] Bitfinger#6245
One of the main value propositions of crypto is its ability to cut out the middle man and that's exactly what mm2/ atomicdex etc. will do for those who prefer it that way. You don't need huge volumes from big traders when you can get more from many small traders/swappers

[09-Jan-20 08:04 PM] Bitfinger#6245
@joe2x4 imo it will be difficult to attract developers without a working product in the wild. Theories are just theories until people can see it working.

[09-Jan-20 08:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It took WordPress a decade to be the top CMS,   February begins year 3.    Still very early

[09-Jan-20 08:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And for those who remember , WordPress circa 2006-2007 was clunky and riddled with bugs and holes

[09-Jan-20 08:08 PM] Bitfinger#6245
@polycryptoblog I agree, but you need to get an Alpha release out, even with some bugs so people can see what's going on. Just look at Ethereum and it succeeded, full of bugs and unscaleable, but got out there first

[09-Jan-20 08:11 PM] joe2x4#5987
I believe that there was a suggestion that we first needed examples of what the various cc could do. Well wouldn't that be a good topic for a hackathon?  Are the CC antara modules working and at this point for people to start building on them?

[09-Jan-20 08:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

Now that's cool. I'd love to see more of this, videos of the students talking about their projects and experiences, interview this professor, let's hear what he has to say, suggestions. Will this program be replicated elsewhere?

[09-Jan-20 08:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, currently Marmara University in Turkey is working on a Komodo smartchain,  they have government interest in it as well,  it‚Äôs a post dated check system pretty innovative, actually one of the projects I‚Äôm super excited to see come to fruition.    We plan on reaching out to more universities as well.  If I remember right university of Vienna is doing something to but I can‚Äôt remember exactly what they were working on

[09-Jan-20 08:23 PM] joe2x4#5987
About the post dated check system, am very interested in this as well.

[09-Jan-20 08:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There is a channel in this discord for them ,  mainly their stuff is done in Turkish though

[09-Jan-20 08:27 PM] joe2x4#5987
Well, the original topic was how to encourage this sort of behavior. Is there or will there be any Komodo grant $ or the jl777 prize of excellence type of carrot on stick awards?

[09-Jan-20 08:28 PM] joe2x4#5987
Will there be two universities in the states this year?

[09-Jan-20 08:29 PM] joe2x4#5987
Could always run a fund raiser for prize $. The whole do your part, support the ecosystem prize of excellence

[09-Jan-20 08:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There was a scholarship for the Texas students hackathon given by us, so it‚Äôs incentivized.  Getting uni‚Äôs to hop on board isn‚Äôt easy but we will keep reaching out to them ,  I would like to get something going with CMU, they reject our first proposal a long time ago but we came at it like a currency ,  next time will come at it like a platform.

I don‚Äôt believe he is focusing on uni‚Äôs ,  currently he is working on other stuff.  But any opportunity that comes up , Komodo is agile enough to shift some focus

Main things I‚Äôm hoping to see AtomicDex polished and people using it as comfortably as they do something like Shapeshift, ultimately something that‚Äôs superior in every way. I think with Defi work, pegs and perhaps some other CC cleverness, we could see a highly decentralized trading system where the speed starts to resemble CEX (AtomicDex doesn‚Äôt even have the only mm1.0 zero conf tech implemented yet!), perhaps by using kBTC tokens to circumvent Btc sluggishness. AtomicDex/MM2+Defi/pegs stuff KMD is working I think is going to blow some minds.

[09-Jan-20 09:06 PM] tolken#2655
Lots of cool stuff going on in KMD land, fascinating projects in isolation, but the sum of the parts will be something truly exceptional and we‚Äôre certainly getting close to this convergence of technologies.

[09-Jan-20 09:12 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm also hoping RedFox brings something to the table after the k64 mess. They are teasing blockchain game stuff again, I think that stands the chance to excite a lot of people. What other platform would let you ‚Äòatomic swap‚Äô virtually any crypto right into a blockchain based game? Just load up with Btc, eth or whatever and MM2 could automatically load your game with native tokens. Cash out to your coin of choice. Fucking brilliant stuff.

[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] joe2x4#5987
Is anyone else besides polycryptoblog working to integrate with a university?  Maybe we could cultivate some additional options? Can the people like cryptorich and other bloggers interview the University of Texas Arlington professor please?

[09-Jan-20 11:14 PM] joe2x4#5987
So we have two people (Steve Lee and Polycryptoblog) who have experience with pitching universities. We have two universities that already worked with; with 2 professors and 2 groups of students. In two countries and languages. This sounds like the right recipe for developing a standardized university pitch. What was the details regarding the scholarship/grants? Was it positive? Where did the funds come from? Are more of these grants available?  And finally, how about running a bounty or refferal bonus for anyone that can get a university to work/develop with komodo. Do you just want anyone to pitch to a University or would you pay a finder's fee for a success?

[09-Jan-20 11:27 PM] joe2x4#5987
What information do you need to get the ball rolling to approach a university?
