[dscrdvrsc] <Papaburger> hey guys do u if i can download the verus blockchain from somewhere other than agama wallet ? cause the native Verus coin download will take a millenium to end

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @Papaburger use the bootstrap on the verus webpage

[dscrdvrsc] <cryptokarma> @Papaburger Try an open Web Proxy IFA a download from Github takes to long, Samen happens to me

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Price question. Sorry if it is stupid not an expert here. Would the price of Verus get high like 5-10usd range or does the price have to stay low for usage/mass adoption.

[dscrdvrsc] <á‚ á‚¬á‚£á‚½á›•á›•Â·áµ›Ê³Ë¢á¶œï¼ > the price is what people are willing to pay to get it ðŸ˜‰

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @á‚ á‚¬á‚£á‚½á›•á›•Â·áµ›Ê³Ë¢á¶œï¼  I understand that but if this coin is going to be used for many things if the price is to high would that stop people from using it?

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Let's just say voting for example. If the price of verus was 1000 usd and you need 100 verus to buy an Id people will not do that

[07-Jan-20 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Trust me I want the price to rise. I am just throwing this out there

[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> Price of an ID can be changed afaik

[07-Jan-20 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> and the high price of bitcoin never stopped anyone from using it. Good thing cryptos can be divided by alot

[07-Jan-20 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <á‚ á‚¬á‚£á‚½á›•á›•Â·áµ›Ê³Ë¢á¶œï¼ > @Crypto278 agree what Meyse said, and once there are PBaaS, those can also offer IDs, same functionality, but probably different price.
