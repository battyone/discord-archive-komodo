[dscrd-hush] <Oso> hello all

[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> Id just like to ask, if the details and exact time of the process of transforming HUSH into shielded adress only is yet to be announced.

[07-Jan-20 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Dochteur The evolution of HUSH into shielded adress only will be realized this year. There is no specify date set for now.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Dochteur official time/block height has not been set, we are still working on our Network Upgrade coming on Jan 29th ðŸ™‚

[07-Jan-20 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FYI, no matter what, you can always still access your taddr funds, even after we go fully shielded.

[07-Jan-20 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> After we go full z2z, you will only be able to *send* to a zaddr, sending from a taddr must always be allowed, because mining goes into a taddr.

[07-Jan-20 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, no worries about not being able to access funds in a transparent address. We will always support taddrs in some way. We are just limiting *sending to them*, sometime in the future.

[07-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Disabling the ability to send from a taddr => taddr, is what is usually called "fully shielded" or z2z, also both terms are misleading/incorrectly used

[07-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's pretty close tho! Mining goes to a taddr, and looks like it always will. Mining to a zaddr directly "shielded coinbase" or zcoinbase, has grave metadata implications

Chosen-prefix Collision on SHA-1 with 900 decent GPU's means many mining farms can easily produce them! As an example, they produced two GnuPGv1 keys which have identical SHA-1's, breaking identity certification.
SHA-1 is a Shambles! https://t.co/1GTQEwsWNM

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For the less technical: SHA1 is now even more broken, and cheaper to break, than it was before. Small mining farms could do it as a service, and some probably already are doing that.
