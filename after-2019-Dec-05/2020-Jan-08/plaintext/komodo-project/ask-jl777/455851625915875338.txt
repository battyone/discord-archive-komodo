2  blasters  @  240/sec  Mem 
 @  450 MiB  and slowly rising  CPU @  49%~Intel  Core i3-3220 CPU @ 3.30GHz √ó 4  will go  back  to  1  blaster  if  crash ~

[07-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i added mutex to avoid the crashes after an hour, waiting for the one hour to pass to make sure it solves the issue. but an unexpected doubling in speed happened! usually when you add a mutex, the overhead slows things down. i was careful in where i put them to minimize the slowdown, but a doubling of speed was unexpected!  what that means is that without the mutex, there were a lot of hardware/system inefficiencies due to the overlapped access to the same memory by different threads. i still have txpow active, but it could be that we can achieve 20k/sec now without it

bug is not fixed, so things are still unstable after an hour. this will take a while to solve and i seems better to refactor that code to get a cleaner algo, then debug it if it is still crashing

@jl777c what part of the data blob is changed randomly for calculating txpow ?

[07-Jan-20 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
a nonce is added to the end of the payload

[07-Jan-20 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also a header added, one part for routing, another for the indexing

[07-Jan-20 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
[relaydepth][funcid][timestamp] [index header] [payload] [nonce]

[07-Jan-20 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the [payload] is the hex or ascii that is submitted (or its encrypted form)

[07-Jan-20 09:39 AM] gcharang#6833
got it

[07-Jan-20 11:54 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c for the command `DEX_broadcast hex priority` 
priority is 5
size of hex is 16.1KB

will the hash have 5 zero bits after 0x777 or 5 + 4 = 9 zero bits?

[07-Jan-20 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
9

@gcharang it is missing params to launch  DEXP2P chain.

[07-Jan-20 12:50 PM] gcharang#6833
hmm, will add it
but the DEXP2P chain is only relevant to the current testing
the tech itself can be used on any smart chain

[07-Jan-20 12:51 PM] Mark81#4505
oh, you're right.

[07-Jan-20 12:51 PM] Mark81#4505

@jl777c Still wondering how it is prevented to not spam broadcasts? What prevents to create false data to network?

[07-Jan-20 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
what is one mans false data is another mans valuable data

[07-Jan-20 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
who is to say what is spam and what isnt

[07-Jan-20 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
you can create data at 0 priority and if the network has capacity, it will relay it. if not, it will drop it

[07-Jan-20 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want it to not be dropped you need to increase the priority and also the hashing cost

[07-Jan-20 01:39 PM] Mark81#4505
For DEX orderbooks it will be very valuable to have working messaging system and probably Atomic-API relies to that function.

[07-Jan-20 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
when the minimum txpow is a diff of 12, it will take 1 second per message

[07-Jan-20 01:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill  guess amountA and  B have  to  be an integer and what about  negative values?

[07-Jan-20 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
how exactly do you plan to spam the network then?

[07-Jan-20 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
amountA and B are floating point format. you can put in negative number, but it will be converted to unsigned (big number)

[07-Jan-20 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it is meant to be the volume of what you are selling for what you want to buy. together it creates a price

[07-Jan-20 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
at one second per packet, it would take 10,000 cores to saturate the network

[07-Jan-20 01:43 PM] Mark81#4505
So messages are mined without actual blocks produced

[07-Jan-20 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
no blocks

[07-Jan-20 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
each message has txpow that is configurable

[07-Jan-20 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so if the atomicDEX client notices the network is congested, it simply uses a higher priority

[07-Jan-20 01:44 PM] Mark81#4505
Clever!

[07-Jan-20 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
just going to priority 1 makes it now take 20,000 cores to saturate the network

[07-Jan-20 01:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
got a -1 response

[07-Jan-20 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
lets make it priority of 4, that is the pain threshold of 16 seconds per message to send. but now it takes 160,000 cores to saturate
