but i guess there are cases where we want to use -datadir and it sounds like something is messed up. i will add to list

[07-Jan-20 02:41 PM] gcharang#6833
maybe the bug is not specifically related to -datadir 
it could be because of two daemons on same computer and sharing RAM

[07-Jan-20 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
ram isnt shared between daemons

[07-Jan-20 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you mean it is running out

[07-Jan-20 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
there does seem to be a problem with -datadir daemons

[07-Jan-20 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be low priority for now

[07-Jan-20 02:53 PM] gcharang#6833
got it

[07-Jan-20 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
temporarily changed "one hour" to 5 minutes to speed up the debug cycle for this pesky bug

[07-Jan-20 03:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
think ill  send  an .png image  later  using  base64  and  break it up  into  1024  packets  using  tagA  as  the  image  name  and tagB as  packet number  /  maybe  use  amountA  ....   looks like  images  can  be  sent  in  less  than  64 packets

[07-Jan-20 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is a good test

[07-Jan-20 04:05 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Packet (name / type / number /size)  ----  yeah..  can  decode  this  data

[07-Jan-20 04:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
where to put  total  amount of packets in  complete  file? probably  "size" or  amountB

[07-Jan-20 04:12 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
name  =  "tagA"  type  =  "tagB" packet_total = amountA packet_number=  amountB

[07-Jan-20 04:12 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  got  this

[07-Jan-20 04:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
broadcasting  only  works  while  node  is  on?  the  data does  not  get  saved  on the P2P  network? ---  my eariler  message was  gone  when  I  restarted  node --- OK , so  this is  why you are  not worried  about  spam -- if you dont  look for it it  will not bog you down -- data  is  stored  locally  and  broadcasted

[07-Jan-20 04:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  think

[07-Jan-20 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed temp fix to the crashing after 1 hour problem. now it shouldnt crash, though memory usage will gradually go up

[07-Jan-20 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
need more time for a better solution

[07-Jan-20 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
currently you can only sync to the realtime data stream

[07-Jan-20 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
with remote queries to fullnodes you can get the "historical" data (one hour)

[07-Jan-20 04:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
to  save  the  data  you would need  other  nodes  saving  data  from same  pubkey - eventually  seednodes will store history

[07-Jan-20 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
all the nodes that are online will have all the packets they processed

[07-Jan-20 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you restart your node... the data is gone

[07-Jan-20 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i guess i could make a way to save current state, but not sure it is worth it if we will have fullnodes able to do remote requests

[07-Jan-20 04:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
trying  to  find  a usecase  to  save  swap  files and  other  data  for amnesiac OS

[07-Jan-20 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if we get 1000 per second, the amount of data is quite large... saving it opens up all sorts of issues. of course, a layer on top of the messaging layer can implement any sort of crazy thing, including persistent storage, but that is for another day

[07-Jan-20 04:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yup

[07-Jan-20 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
latest version prevents negative numbers as inputs
