Thank you. No, I was searching for a Tutorial Guide with Docker: learn-kmd. Below Link is just the TUT1: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/beginner-series-part-1.html

If you are still using gnupgv1, maybe don't do that anymore (default on ubuntu 16.x, btw) : https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1214594006551875588

Chosen-prefix Collision on SHA-1 with 900 decent GPU's means many mining farms can easily produce them! As an example, they produced two GnuPGv1 keys which have identical SHA-1's, breaking identity certification.
