It closes after a while it's connected.
It runs for three or five seconds and closes.

@Paro what is `MARMARATEST`?

[07-Jan-20 11:42 PM] Paro#7842
my test blockchain

[07-Jan-20 11:42 PM] Regnar#6164
I just tried that and it couldn't find chain and defaulted to KMD

[07-Jan-20 11:42 PM] Paro#7842
I was using it in my blockchain.

[07-Jan-20 11:42 PM] Regnar#6164
are you also running a full node of your chain?

[07-Jan-20 11:43 PM] Regnar#6164
somewhere else I mean

[07-Jan-20 11:43 PM] Paro#7842
yes

[07-Jan-20 11:44 PM] Paro#7842
"52.150.41.146" works here

[07-Jan-20 11:46 PM] Regnar#6164
does your node have `-nSPV=1`?

[07-Jan-20 11:47 PM] Paro#7842
asset....conf ?

[07-Jan-20 11:47 PM] Paro#7842
I think I need to add

[07-Jan-20 11:48 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not actually sure man, I'm pretty new to nspv. I would assume you have to adjust the conf file to include at least a starter node

[07-Jan-20 11:48 PM] Regnar#6164
<https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins> like these have IPs for nodes under `"nspv":"52.150.41.146"`

[07-Jan-20 11:50 PM] Regnar#6164
but I also think your node needs to be started with the `nSPV=1` param too.

Are you currently using "libnspv" ?

[07-Jan-20 11:55 PM] Regnar#6164
yea i am, I'm seeing the same problem with that after adding it to my coins file
