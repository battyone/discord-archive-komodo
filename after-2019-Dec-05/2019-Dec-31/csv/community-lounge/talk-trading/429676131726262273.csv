The idea of Pirate Chain overtaking Monero was floated as ""probable"" or ""obvious"" by some of the more fanciful personalities in here.  And they were making such predictions on a short time frame as well, like within a year or two.  Heh.  Time may prove my opinion incorrect, but with the hindsight we have, ARRR looks like a thrown together cash grab by the KMD mining community.  Much (if not all) of the hype was projected by the miners (surprise!).","","troll_hmm (1)"
