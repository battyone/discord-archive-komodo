I would like to keep everything encrypted that can be (I realize the address that I use for staking Verus wont be encrypted since it has to be on full node wallet).
I created a litemode custom seed wallet on agama desktop with my seed from atomicdex. It looks like I can only encrypt this seed after creation, not during such as when using a non-custom seed. 
If I go into agama wallet settings and enter the seed under 'encrypt seed', supply an encrypt password, is this too late? Is the wallet already stored on my computer in non-encrypted form? Hmmm, maybe I should have done that step first THEN accessed the wallet in agama...
I believe the atomicdex wallet is encrypted upon creation, correct? If so, that solves that part.","",""

I suppose the answer might be: ""the wallet is decrypted in ram while in use but there is never a decrypted file on the drive""?

Also, I noticed that when creating a wallet in agama with default 'iguana (256 bits)' selected, it generates a 24 word mnemonic phrase (15 word with waves checked and 12 word with nxt checked), yet atomic dex generates a 12 word phrase. Could i create a 24 word phrase in agama and restore it into atomicdex?","",""

yes. Just use the ""Custom seed"" option while restoring the wallet

creating a seed(non-custom) in Agama and restoring it in AtomicDex solves the issue","",""

Yes so I now created an encrypted non-custom 24 word seed in agama and restored it into the atomicdex app. I then exported my verus address in wif format and imported it into my agama native wallet so now i can stake the funds i am trading on atomicdex, sweet!","",""

Does mm2 have that functionality?

Hopefully i'm remembering barterdex correctly, but perhaps i'm getting confused with it just querying its own orderbooks' prices?","",""

so did i: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools
it uses coinpaprika as price source and sets bid/ask-margin according to the settings in mpm.conf.dex","",""

if the version is correct, try shutting down the app completely (might need to use ""force stop"" on android)
if that doesn't help, try reinstalling the app","",""
