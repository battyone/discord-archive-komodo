Hi, I hope everyone had an exceptional year and congratulations to the Komodo team for providing the crypto market, education and training in the new technology which, having a huge impact on the society, I notice that throwing the technological markets is massive towards artificial intelligence and we will see projects that want to collaborate with those at komodo, a happy new year for everyone

My pleasure to follow Komodo from beginning

[30-Dec-19 12:42 PM] CMaurice#1685
I'd like to echo those sentiments: I've really enjoyed coming to a more settled understanding of how the komodoverse progresses and its direction, and looking forward to the next year

[30-Dec-19 12:44 PM] kaks#6612

only 246 Arrr in NAV ...

[30-Dec-19 04:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also interesting byteball is not any more on cmc... not sure usd values are good ?

[30-Dec-19 04:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
obyte is the new name

[30-Dec-19 04:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes

[30-Dec-19 04:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but anyway nav page is not relevant

[30-Dec-19 04:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if there is no liquidity for Obyte 70k USD is just a dream, reality is like 7-10k USD

[30-Dec-19 04:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
judging by mcap chart Obyte looks pretty dead

[30-Dec-19 04:39 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
same with vericoin

[30-Dec-19 04:40 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
syscoin a bit better

[30-Dec-19 04:40 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
heat looks absolute dead

[30-Dec-19 04:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
biggest potential is KMD and VRSC

[30-Dec-19 04:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
KMD needs to push some projects to be actually usable, so manny assets which are not actually worth sth ....

[30-Dec-19 04:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
VRSC should bump value soon so will be good for NAV

[30-Dec-19 04:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
KMD I bet will gain after some other assets representing tech will mature

[30-Dec-19 04:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
like Chips maybe

[30-Dec-19 04:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or DEX

[30-Dec-19 04:44 PM] steinsg8#0288
Tell me one asset in crypto with over 1 mill users and meaningful utility. None to my knowledge.

[30-Dec-19 04:45 PM] steinsg8#0288
I hope dex will be the first.

[30-Dec-19 04:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not sure about others, BOTS, BET PANGEA .. burners ?

[30-Dec-19 04:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
time to finish up some things and have reality check if people realyl want it - if not starting anything new another asset makes no sense...

[30-Dec-19 04:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
maybe people dont want dex and in reality cex are good enough

[30-Dec-19 04:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for sure fees will not be big for dex, even cexes live from listing fees mostly

[30-Dec-19 04:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sell side for DEX should be security, if supported by usability would be good enough, and then fees could be even higher, personally I dont care even when fees are 1%, byuing crypto is like risking 10-50% most of the time

[30-Dec-19 04:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's only for the bots to have low fees with frequent trades...

[30-Dec-19 04:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok an maybe that builds up liquidity

[30-Dec-19 04:49 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but fees dont have to be lower then cexes, might be actually 2x higher

[30-Dec-19 04:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@steinsg8 I think BNB could count as over 1 M users :abusedsmily: maybe ?

[30-Dec-19 04:55 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
when Komodo succeed to produce significant gains of value at least in some existing assets it will attract real money, otherwise the ecosystem will have problem developing

[30-Dec-19 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 the ARRR is visible because someone mined a block to the transparant supernet address in the first or second day

[30-Dec-19 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
iirc

[30-Dec-19 05:24 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ah I see, so Supernet own more Arrr, just it's hidden ?

[30-Dec-19 05:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think the policy was that as long as you cant publically verify supernet holds x amount of ARRR in a Z address it wouldnt buy any pirate

[30-Dec-19 05:34 PM] LocoMB#8593
anyone from KMD team aware of this platform?

[30-Dec-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What the fuck is ccx and how did they get so many votes

[30-Dec-19 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks many said the same about ARRR_

[30-Dec-19 08:47 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what the fuck

[30-Dec-19 08:48 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
when i voted 1 hr ago it was 50/50

[30-Dec-19 08:48 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and now they have like 95%

[30-Dec-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because more than 413 people care about ccx?

[30-Dec-19 09:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because bots

[30-Dec-19 10:15 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
has the pirate team thought of integrating an ID system like conceal has, where rather than an address you use a username for convenience

[30-Dec-19 10:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wouldn't that be against the use case of being the most private coin out?

[30-Dec-19 10:27 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
well the usernames would still be shielded on chain

[30-Dec-19 10:27 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
j like addresses are now

[30-Dec-19 10:28 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
it wld just be so users dont have to copypaste full addresses

[30-Dec-19 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because that 4th mouse click can be such a burden

[30-Dec-19 11:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
@FlyingDutchman you can create zs vanity addresses with the paper wallet but i advise against it

[30-Dec-19 11:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
anything out of "randomness" sticks out like a sore thumb
