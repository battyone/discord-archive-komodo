[30-Dec-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> nice bot

[30-Dec-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> It's probably not a team member doing that

[30-Dec-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> It could be anyone

[30-Dec-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> We had lots of attacks on us lately

[30-Dec-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763

Mocho used the bot, to pit us against each other

[30-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> No?

[30-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> doubt it

[30-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> idk.. ask him

[30-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> it was mostly a joke

[30-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> but anyone could have done it, was my point

[30-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @MOCHO 17 sir, did you manipulate poll? :troll:

[30-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> I bet it was samson

[30-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> I still go with zooko as my first guess

[30-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> zooko only hates me

[30-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Yea anyone could have done it

[30-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Dec-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763

@jiucrypto @TheInfamousKata @cryptomocho I think its easy to see that arrr community has manipulated that at the end when they were getting beat. Why would any project want to win 95 to 5. Bullshit
