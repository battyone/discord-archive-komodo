[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Do they do interiews @+dreamTim  ?

[30-Dec-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> video...

[30-Dec-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> they have blogs and we can get a lot of publicity i think by doing something with them, but sure, I can look also for more straightforward influencers out there :pirate:

[30-Dec-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> Ah yes, indeed. It will be great to have pirate those places. Amazing even!
The hackernoon article (or was it hacked...) was super cool.

[30-Dec-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> So just so i'm clear, I'm trying to send Draeth more places for video.

If anyone has any influencers or media outlets they really like, with less community crossover (out of our echo chamber) that Draeth should go interview on, drop the names here please!

[30-Dec-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ahmed of $ETHO> @Draeth amazing interview

@zcashla The problem is that opting IN to privacy in a transparent ecosystem can even cause suspicion. While it wouldn't be suspicious at all if EVERYONE used it. ZEC would never be my first choice as an ecosystem when I REALLY want privacy. BUT:
