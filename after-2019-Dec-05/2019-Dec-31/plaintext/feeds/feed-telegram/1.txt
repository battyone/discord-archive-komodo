[telegram] <Regnar> Hyperdex definitely has a more "trading" feel with orderbook charts etc. I personally see Atomicdex as decentralized changelly/shapeshift even if that isn't the official approach (re @Suzycrabgrass: I mean hyperdex seems more user friendly)

[telegram] <deftlypoking> I have a fear that hyperdex and atomicdex wont be ready till another 6 months. By then, the DEX market will be saturated:/

[30-Dec-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <iqly_almond> binance will made atomic dex too i guess (re @deftlypoking: I have a fear that hyperdex and atomicdex wont be ready till another 6 months. By then, the DEX market will be saturated:/)

[30-Dec-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deftlypoking> That's not good considering their advantage is offering a listing for high volume coins on their centralized ex. (re @iqly_almond: binance will made atomic dex too i guess)

[30-Dec-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <iqly_almond> Cex is suffering with regulation now
soon they will  shutdown (re @deftlypoking: That's not good considering their advantage is offering a listing for high volume coins on their centralized ex.)

[30-Dec-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deftlypoking> I think no, governments need cexs to track people. (re @iqly_almond: Cex is suffering with regulation now
soon they will  shutdown)

[30-Dec-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deftlypoking> They might hate DEXs though.

[30-Dec-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <iqly_almond> People doesnt wanna be tracked
you see some exchange shutdown bc of kyc (re @deftlypoking: I think no, governments need cexs to track people.)

[telegram] <iqly_almond> Coinexchange, cryptobridge
It was good exchange before but its closed

[30-Dec-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> I think atomicdex needs bots in order for people to reduce slippage by buying over a prolonged period of time. We need good liquidity, still my biggest worry. I've seen HEAT die due to lack of liquidity and interest.

[30-Dec-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> From my understanding in the future it will be easy for anyone to run a LP node and make money off spread

[30-Dec-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> Eventually getting liquidity from all cex through people becoming market makers

[30-Dec-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> Solves the low liquidity issue :P interest hopefully will grow too as people get fed up with cex and realise not your keys not your coins

[30-Dec-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <KomodoWorld> Saturated by what? afaik the only other atomic swap DEX is Blocknet that is far behind in ease of use. The others are Dex mostly in name (re @deftlypoking: I have a fear that hyperdex and atomicdex wont be ready till another 6 months. By then, the DEX market will be saturated:/)

[30-Dec-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
