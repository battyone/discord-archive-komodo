@artemciy_dice I was just looking through the nohup.out to get a feel for what's spit out. I see "[swap uuid=<uuid>] Finished" This looks fairly straight  forward. I shouldn't expect to find any info in logs about the trade specifics, like price, amount etc - the idea is just to look that info up in the DB/SWAP (json) files?

[30-Dec-19 12:47 AM] tolken#2655
Is there anything in the json files that indicates the state (like if its finished?) I see a list of 'states' but not necessarily where its at. It seems like I'd have to look up the TX's to see if they went through or not.

Specifics should be available through the API.

[30-Dec-19 12:51 AM] tolken#2655
Ahh right, or just query the API. Is there a difference between the SWAPS/MY vs SWAPS/STATS ? The data seems very close if not identical, although MY seems to list all attempted trades where stats seems to contain only finished ones. Not terribly important, just curious. I was thinking I shouldn't query the API too often from the remarks earlier, but maybe that's mainly an issue for my_recent_swaps, more so than swap_status?

[30-Dec-19 01:15 AM] tolken#2655
I'd imagine once I identify a state I'm looking for in the nohup.out log, I'll generally only need to query the swap_status once to get the amount/rel/coin info needed.

Also, used setprice and used the volume to limit to 0.5, despite there being 5 total. After what may have been a failed trade, the max volume is showing as 0.4 something. Shouldnâ€™t that 0.5 remain 0.5, or reset after each trade? Is not the idea to limit the max amount a single trade can trade, or is it an absolute session limit?

[30-Dec-19 04:17 AM] tolken#2655
If it were per trade, Iâ€™d imagine it would always be 0.5. This feels like itâ€™s per session. Imagine one has 100btc available on bdex, but wants only a max of 10btc traded per order. If I set volume to 10, I get the impression that after 10btc are transacted nothing will be available for trading, despite there being 90btc left. I suppose one could just re-set it back to 10 manually with setprice if so desired.

And also a mm1.0 request I had, would it be possible to add a minimum order size? Often times exchanges demand $10-20 minimum trades. It seems ideal that mm2 would allow the maker to define/customize this on a coin by coin basis and somehow echo back a clear error back to the taker why the trade wasnâ€™t permitted.

@tolken Hi, `Is there a difference between the SWAPS/MY vs SWAPS/STATS ?` - yes, there's a difference:
1. SWAPS/MY contains only swaps made by your node.
2. SWAPS/STATS contains statistical data of other nodes swaps too if your node is seednode.
`After what may have been a failed trade, the max volume is showing as 0.4 something. Shouldnâ€™t that 0.5 remain 0.5, or reset after each trade?` - when order is partially matched the available order amount is decreased. It's considered as limit order which is supposed to trade no more than the volume set initially. If we allow MM2 to "refill" the order in case of successfull trade it will actually mean that your entire balance is available for specific order: 0.5 is partially filled with 0.1, your balance is 0.9. It partially fills again, your balance becomes 0.8 etc etc. In this case you just may set the `max:true` to make the entire balance available right away and save on miner fees because you have a chance to trade all your coins in 1 swap.
Other exchanges work similar way for limit orders, you may have 100 BTC deposit. When you set the limit 1BTC/1000KMD order it will use only 1 BTC reducing the order amount if it's partially filled.
And yes,when swap fails available amount should be increased back, but MM2 doesn't handle it as of now. It will be implemented later.

`And also a mm1.0 request I had, would it be possible to add a minimum order size?` - yes, it's good request and there's the issue about it already: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/473. Will be implemented.

@artem.pikulin thanks so much for the thorough answers. Great to be back at this!

[30-Dec-19 06:38 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@tolken You're welcome, it's nice to talk to you again ðŸ™‚

[30-Dec-19 06:48 AM] tolken#2655
Same to you. Iâ€™m sorry I kinda went MIA just as all the nitty gritty took place with mm2 testing, just a lot of life happened this past year, not the good kind. But fortunately, things are settled down for now, so I plan to pickup where I left off with a lot more time on my hands, for a duration anyway. Looking forward to it!
