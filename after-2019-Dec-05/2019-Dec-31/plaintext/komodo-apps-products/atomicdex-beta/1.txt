i'm looking at best way to use agama verus wallet for staking verus while using that verus amount to provide some liquidity on atomicdex. 
I would like to keep everything encrypted that can be (I realize the address that I use for staking Verus wont be encrypted since it has to be on full node wallet).
I created a litemode custom seed wallet on agama desktop with my seed from atomicdex. It looks like I can only encrypt this seed after creation, not during such as when using a non-custom seed. 
If I go into agama wallet settings and enter the seed under 'encrypt seed', supply an encrypt password, is this too late? Is the wallet already stored on my computer in non-encrypted form? Hmmm, maybe I should have done that step first THEN accessed the wallet in agama...
I believe the atomicdex wallet is encrypted upon creation, correct? If so, that solves that part.

While on the encryption topic, may i ask- when atomicdex app is open and running on my phone, is the wallet still encrypted? I suppose the answer might be: "the wallet is decrypted in ram while in use but there is never a decrypted file on the drive"?

Also, I noticed that when creating a wallet in agama with default 'iguana (256 bits)' selected, it generates a 24 word mnemonic phrase (15 word with waves checked and 12 word with nxt checked), yet atomic dex generates a 12 word phrase. Could i create a 24 word phrase in agama and restore it into atomicdex?

yes. Just use the "Custom seed" option while restoring the wallet

> I believe the atomicdex wallet is encrypted upon creation, correct?
yes

creating a seed(non-custom) in Agama and restoring it in AtomicDex solves the issue

[30-Dec-19 08:00 AM] CiPhEr#2091
cool, thanks gcharang! Yes so I now created an encrypted non-custom 24 word seed in agama and restored it into the atomicdex app. I then exported my verus address in wif format and imported it into my agama native wallet so now i can stake the funds i am trading on atomicdex, sweet!

question- I remember back in the barterdex days when setting up to be a liquidity provider, the software would query some outside data providers and you can set it up to price your orders for a certain % over or under that value. Does mm2 have that functionality?

Hopefully i'm remembering barterdex correctly, but perhaps i'm getting confused with it just querying its own orderbooks' prices?

[30-Dec-19 12:34 PM] cipi#4502
that functionality is not in mm2 any more, but several people have written their own scripts and tools to do that
so did i: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools
it uses coinpaprika as price source and sets bid/ask-margin according to the settings in mpm.conf.dex

Hello!
Does VRSC actually works on AtomicDex? Can‚Äôt load...

[30-Dec-19 02:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@psyfont can you confirm that you are using the version 0.2.11?
if the version is correct, try shutting down the app completely (might need to use "force stop" on android)
if that doesn't help, try reinstalling the app

[30-Dec-19 03:34 PM] psyfont#8247
Thanks! @gcharang I was using the older version

@cipi thanks! That was exactly what I was looking for:) I'll have to check out your tool and become better aquatinted with all of this soon

Your dex looks pretty cool. There is no clear winner in the dex offering yet. Most are crap but if u include btc + low fees u could be the standout winner. Most dex's use WBTC which is crap.

[30-Dec-19 08:39 PM] OrgiOrg#1001
at the moment the the DEX address holds about 7.000 - 8.000$? Or do i miss out something?

it includes some external coins like BTC, LTC and DASH, but not all of them

Adressviewer showing old balance on BTC DEX Adress - BTC Adress is holding more
