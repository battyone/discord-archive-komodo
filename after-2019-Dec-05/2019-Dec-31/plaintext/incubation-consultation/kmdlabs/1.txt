[30-Dec-19 01:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[30-Dec-19 01:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
FEK!

[30-Dec-19 01:25 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I wonder what happened

[30-Dec-19 01:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I am  reindexed

[30-Dec-19 01:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
OMG -- like gone

[30-Dec-19 01:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
If you have the original wallet just sync it from block 0

[30-Dec-19 01:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
Your coins are there the once you mined staked on the fork will be gone

[30-Dec-19 01:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
pretty sure  I just did

[30-Dec-19 01:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
But you never had those forked coins anyways

[30-Dec-19 01:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I owned 60k LABS

[30-Dec-19 01:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[30-Dec-19 01:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

I have done everything except trace outgoing txs while  I was on vacation

[30-Dec-19 02:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
and this is why i suggested that last param jok3r made for us... so all stakes could return to their original address. o no matter what... your 64 keys hold it all... no random addys losing coins when the daemon goes to shit.

[30-Dec-19 02:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
oh boy -- ill try all my wallet  backups but I just imported all  the dumps ---

[30-Dec-19 02:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
if you had the splitperc set to 100... you were sending stakes and utxos to random addresses

[30-Dec-19 02:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I highly doupt  im  gunna  find them

IDK if the explorer is up to date but you might just check a few addresses there see if the balance is correct
