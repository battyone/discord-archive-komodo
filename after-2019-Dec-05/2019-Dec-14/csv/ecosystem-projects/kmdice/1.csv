I previously bought kmdice at DP and thought gonna buy more when it is added in AtomicDex. Well I'll still hodl strong this coin. ðŸ˜… 

I have few questions here:
1) Can games based on probabilities like roulettes, Sic-bo where players' choice do affect the result be implemented?

2) In case of dealer timeout, could there be refund instead of automatically win?

Sorry for the long post here.","",""
