No fees, and 80% creation of coin. I presume 20% is the safety net / in case coin drops in value the cc will liquidate the holdings? If not then my whole theory is wrong. 

If that is how it works though, say I have $10,000 I want to invest into kmd. Kmd is currently at $1

Option 1: I buy 10,000kmd like normal 

Option 2: I buy 10,000kmd, issue myself $8000 in stablecoins. If komodo rises, ie goes to say $5, I still only repay $10,000 to claim back 10,000kmd so no loss (minus tx fees)

However if komodo drops to say 80c, then my coins will be liquidated and I have $8000 in a stablecoin (holding 10,000kmd would have resulted in $8000 net position)
; but if komodo drops further say to 50c, either the liquidation will have stopped me from losing the funds, or if it doesn‚Äôt work that way, I could choose to keep the $8000 instead of paying it back to claim 10,000kmd as 10k kmd = $5000, and not paying back the deposit is the better option financially","",""

true. but, it is another user who will liquidate your holdings for a 5%(if instantly sold at market price) profit

you only have to repay $8000 to get back your 10,000 KMD if price goes up

> However if komodo drops to say 80c, then my coins will be liquidated and I have $8000 in a stablecoin (holding 10,000kmd would have resulted in $8000 net position)
this is what happens

> if komodo drops further say to 50c
it doesn't affect you as your KMD have already been liquidated

> Would the stablecoin be abuseable?
it isn't abuse if someone uses something as it is intended. What you described is the intended behavior","","PeepoThink (1)"

if you want to hold KMD and still get some fiat for a temperory emergency, you can use the peg
after the emergency is over, and you have the fiat, you get back the KMD

this way, you will escape from the volatility cost that will affect you if you sold and bought","",""
