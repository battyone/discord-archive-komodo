ofc I can't vouch for that. I haven't used the wallet and don't own a ledger

but, from what I know of ledger, it won't allow privkeys to leave the device
the feasible way to  cheat a user is change the displayed destination address on the computer, but  I think ledger has a contermeasure for that too
you have to confirm the destination on the ledger also","",""
