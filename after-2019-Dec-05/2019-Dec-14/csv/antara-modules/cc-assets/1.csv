I had a go of Opensea on eth to create a storefront, like your Pokémon trading aspect.  If you have metamask or opera mobile with crypto wallet support, have a look.

I’d be interested in whether you wanted to make an Opensea for all KMD ecosystem chains of the future?

Opensea has libs to look over how they do things.  They got funding from coinbase & binance labs.

Here’s a blog post of my experience with it: https://hybriddex.com/2019/12/create-storefront-opensea-howto/","",""

I created Komodo-Pokémon just as a proof of concept, I still don't know if I really want to go on & make real products with it","",""
