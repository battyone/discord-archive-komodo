[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Who is responsible for the Pirate Chain Youtube channel?

[dscrd-prt] <Hember> @Cryptofist , I was just wondering as there are people that come into crypto through other platforms than discord and telegram, it would be nice to have more content on a youtube channel.

[13-Dec-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I understand people are doing this somewhat for free, but I was just thinking that when ARRR is taking part in future pirate festivals etc, it might be wise to take some video material to show the world this action.

[13-Dec-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I think there was a poor video of photos from the last festival and this content has been uploaded to some other channel. It might be a good idea to upload on one channel... and also ask the community if someone could edit videos better than that one was edited... I mean it was hard to watch.

Also, there are TWO pirate chain channels on youtube. One channel has one video and the other 4 videos. The channel with the one video is expired. It teaches you to set up Agama wallet from Komodo Platforms page. But after Agama hack people should be using some other wallet. If you can take down the other channels video, that might be a good thing to do.

[13-Dec-19 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> And one more thing: Two last uploaded videos on the channel don't have any custom thumbnail picture. The pic is what sells the video. Might be a good idea to gather pics that the community creates and use those pics as thumbnails. It takes 5 seconds to include a thumbnail photo while uploading content, but it makes the channel look a lot more professional. If you look at the crypto channels that are doing well, they have all included some thumbnail photo to their videos.

[dscrd-prt] <Hember> If needed I can do some editing if I get the material through Google Drive or through some other method.

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> yes

[13-Dec-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Im also learning photoshop, so if I edit a video, I can also provide a thumbnail.

[13-Dec-19 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> By the way, the animations on the channel are great.

@krakenfx Hey krak, you send a lot of spam lately... Please let me know when you finally list KMD, VRSC, ARRR. Trading USDT/EUR is not that much attractive.
