Hi, again. I thought after most of the issues were fixed by jl777, Kmdice is already playable, just missing of GUI. I was waiting for GUI to play it lol.  So the issue was due to CC-Dice not working properly?

I previously bought kmdice at DP and thought gonna buy more when it is added in AtomicDex. Well I'll still hodl strong this coin. ðŸ˜… 

I have few questions here:
1) Can games based on probabilities like roulettes, Sic-bo where players' choice do affect the result be implemented?

2) In case of dealer timeout, could there be refund instead of automatically win?

Sorry for the long post here.
