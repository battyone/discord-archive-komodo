‚ÄùRussian police have raided today the Moscow offices of NGINX, Inc. (‚Ä¶) Rambler Group (‚Ä¶) claiming full ownership of the NGINX web server code. (‚Ä¶) According to the Netcraft December 2019 Web Server Survey, NGINX has market share of 38%.‚Äù https://t.co/XKaF2p9EAk

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> F5 Networks, a US company, recently bought NGINX, Inc, a US company, for $670M USD and now all the founders are under arrest and a Russian company is saying they own Nginx. This is a very interesting story

[13-Dec-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This is a hijacking

[13-Dec-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And the Russian company will probably get away with it

[13-Dec-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Nginx, inc competes for customers with CloudFlare, a Us company

[13-Dec-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am sure it interests RU greatly to have their own CloudFlare, in house, for whatever purposes they desire

[13-Dec-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It does seem the dev wrote code while working at a company, and this company may actually have legal grounds

[13-Dec-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Writing code "in your free time" as a dev is very gray area. When I worked at VMware, they told me I had to fill out forms to work on open source on the weekends, lol. The dev of Nginx, Inc might not have a lot of legal standing, because the code he was working on in his "free time" might be very similar to what he was doing during his day job. If so, it's up to a judge/jury to decide

[13-Dec-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All laws are very grey on this subject, that I know. It's affected me personally so I know a bit about this stuff

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> lol

[13-Dec-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> still not a lot is clear

[13-Dec-19 05:23 AM] kolo#1111
Above about nginx is not fully correct. Thats no form of gov raid, it's Rambler, trillion dollars company where (by location of pc üôÇ nginx was created. Company claims creating nginx was part of dude's daily work, while Sysoev claims he was only sysadmin playing with apache mods to solve load problem. And company was aware about his side project and later used it by agreement. Either side can later prove the point, until than no trust.

[13-Dec-19 05:25 AM] kolo#1111
But sad story anyway. A lot of hijacking can be

[13-Dec-19 05:29 AM] kolo#1111
Wondering what is distance between digging in apache modules, creating own module and porting it to separate project. Can it be sysadmin work or it's a coder work.

[13-Dec-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> @dukeleto  I met a guy that makes Youtube interviews and is interested in privacy coins. He is gaining audience as he just a while ago interviewed Charlie Lee and the CEO of Zcoin. Would you like to be interviewed by this dude? I think I might be able to make this happen. And I could also provide a thumbnail for the video for the dude to help make it look good on youtube search to get more views.

[13-Dec-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Hember I don't think Duke does video interviews. Who knows, maybe..

[13-Dec-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's really awesome that you have those connections. He must be pretty popular, no?

[13-Dec-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Not yet popular as the channel started 4 months ago. I don't understand how he got Charlie Lee on, but he did.

[13-Dec-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Is there a person on the team who would be willing to do interviews at some point? I feel it might be a wise choice as HUSH is now offering real utility with silent dragon and later on with hush droid.

[13-Dec-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> A youtuber us a friend of mine, he had over 20k followers on twitter. Can ask him as well

[13-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <kolo> thanks for the background. And yes, it's not a "gov raid", but it's not clear if it's Rambler.ru calling the shots, or if it's the gov using a company to do their bidding. It's a concerning precedent to set

[13-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain I stopped caring about MTGox proceeding a long time ago, and I suggest you consider all Cryptopia funds lost. They are not even trying to get you your money back, they are trying to pay back investors of the Cryptopia company. You will never see funds again.

[13-Dec-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sucks, but that is the truth with exceedingly high probability

[13-Dec-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hember we have YT people ask this almost every week, usually they want a large some of money and I don't do video interviews. If it was a free interview and just audio, I am not against that in general

[13-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Ok, I'm sure with the dude I know it would be free and as he is into privacy it would probably be OK with audio only.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for fixing our explorer and updating to the latest hush3.git master branch, yay!

[13-Dec-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kolo> @dukeleto it‚Äôs money. Means 650 million dollar company is a good sweet  pie. It has nothing to just own nginx as it‚Äôs open source. They earn on support

[13-Dec-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kolo i never mentioned anything about owning the open source code. This is more subversive. And I have dealt with VMware lawyers, laws do not matter at all

[13-Dec-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What matters is how many lawyers you have

[13-Dec-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> VMware asked me to do illegal things with free software the first day on the job, lol

[13-Dec-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A lot is going on which is not being reported, wheels within wheels. Nginx, Inc is insanely strategic to backdoor

[13-Dec-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if Nginx, Inc is backdoored

[13-Dec-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> derp derp derp

[13-Dec-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the open source code is too

[13-Dec-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, the ability to secretly listen in on TLS connections that Nginx, Inc do as a service you pay for, well, yeah. Metadata goldmine.

[13-Dec-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Nginx had a remote root exploit back in the day

[13-Dec-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What is the value of embedding another one? Maybe $10M or more

[13-Dec-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just a boring CVE is worth $1M USD

[13-Dec-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you had a remote root CVE in nginx, you can own 38% of the web

[13-Dec-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It might be worth much more than $10M. So yeah, there are things happening under the surface. Do not believe anything being reported is even close to reality üôÇ

[13-Dec-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's weird

[13-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just like Uncle Sam and Cloudflare are *best friends*, now Nginx, Inc and FSB are *best friends*

[13-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If they weren't, all the founders would be in jail

One gives remote code execution via "git clone" and others which can overwrite local files:

[dscrd-hush] <kolo> Just recently was announced that Rambler is not side of the conflict. Suit was initiated by foreign (not even Russian !!!) law company who bought right to do all copyright claims to sw projects some time ago

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Nginx, Inc is the service

[13-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kolo> That it‚Äôs related to anyone‚Äôs wish to have backdoor or control

[13-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
