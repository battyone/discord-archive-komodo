@jl777c It seems that combination of aPoW and prices creates some difficulties in mining and node sync. Currently I have 3 nodes i network, only one mining but other 2 nodes won't sync to current chain tip. Also, new blocks need too much time sometimes...

[13-Dec-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
why wont it sync? that seems a bug

[13-Dec-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
what blocktime are you using?

[13-Dec-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe use a 5 minute blocktime?

[13-Dec-19 03:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm using regular blocktime - 1 min

[13-Dec-19 03:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
Now they are synced. I'll monitor it for a while. But definetely when I start daemons they need more time to synce than regular

[13-Dec-19 03:57 PM] Mihailo#5902
And I also have strange node blocking. On one node where I don't mine, I do gatewayswithdraw and then sendrawtransaction and it hangs on send rpc

[13-Dec-19 04:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
Found the blocking reason, my bad didn't do unlock of critical section in gatewayswithdraw

[13-Dec-19 04:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I think the problem with combination of aPoW and pricesCC is that prices reject block if it can't find some correct calc and then aPoW starts again...
```ERROR: CheckTransaction(): invalid script data for coinbase time lock
ContextualCheckBlock failed ht.242```

[13-Dec-19 04:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
I had period with 10 minutes no block

[13-Dec-19 04:47 PM] Mihailo#5902
But also, aPoW seems to run long until it even find block (without prices rejecting it).

[13-Dec-19 04:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
Who made aPoW? Can he checks out what is going on on EURKTEST as I don't have experience with aPoW.

[13-Dec-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
any chain with DTO shouldnt have a blocktime faster than 5 minutes

[13-Dec-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
can you see if the problem goes away with 5 minute blocks?

[13-Dec-19 04:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, how do I set block time to 5 minutes? But block time of 5 minutes will be bad UX with gateways (deposit, claim, withdraw, signing will all last 5 times longer).

[13-Dec-19 04:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
Saw -ac_blocktime, but this will change magic calc?

[13-Dec-19 04:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
I can run another chain without creating oracle, tokens, gateways. Just mine blocks to see how it behaves

[13-Dec-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes ac_blocktime=300

[13-Dec-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
will change magic

[13-Dec-19 05:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
OK, I'll run another chain

[13-Dec-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought you did parallel withdraws

[13-Dec-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so from mempool it does it

[13-Dec-19 05:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, sorry. It won't affect signing as it happens in mempool.

[13-Dec-19 05:01 PM] Mihailo#5902
Let me check if it solves anything, then we'll think how to optimize it.

[13-Dec-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[13-Dec-19 05:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
Another bad thing with 5 minute block would be that for example if external chain is 1 minute block, a lot blocks can accumulate to be submitted in oracle before new block on AC so we'll have to make 10-15 subscribes per publisher in order to be able to submit all blocks and not be to behind external chain.

[13-Dec-19 06:06 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Still same problem even with blocktime 300 (but it may be because chain didn't stabilize yet - blocks were pretty fast), no block for 24 minutes now.

[13-Dec-19 06:07 PM] Mihailo#5902
It seems it was working ok until aPoW kicked in...

[13-Dec-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so apow is not compatible for some reason with a prices chain? this will take a bit to fix. i guess for now skip the adaptivepow, good thing we found this issue

[13-Dec-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
keep that chain alive if you can. i will try to debug it next week

[13-Dec-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but not sure if i will have the time, so best to skip it for this iteration

[13-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
Left it running, if you can just take a look what happens it would be good. I'll also check out when it stabilizes
