I think I have a work around for the zero fees problem.

I think that we can do it by utilizing the reward system (interest).

But first, a couple of words...

People are loss averse. 
Even though transaction fees are very small it can still be irritating (and maybe not so good for accounting purposes but that's another issue).

Daniel Kahneman won the nobel prize on this issue. A loss, even though small, is as twice as painful as a same size gain.

Loss aversion
In cognitive psychology and decision theory, loss aversion refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it is better to not lose $5 than to find $5. The principle is very prominent in the domain of economics. What distinguishes loss ave...

This is how it may work.

When Alice issues a transaction, the fee will be taken from the reward basket instead of the balance.

With that in mind, no one actually took from Alice anything of what she already has. In other words, instead of gaining x interest and losing y fees. Now when she is issuing a transaction she is gaining x-y interest and losing zero! fees.

For some of you it may sound as a small thing but let me assure you that it is not a small matter at all...

It is actually a semantic thing that solves imo the psychological problem. 

Now, lets do some math...
Fees are so small that even if Alice has 100 kmd. By having ~5 kmd rewards per year and assuming 0.0001 kmd per tx,
It would potentially give us ~50,000 txs without taking fees from her own stake. 
I believe that this number is good enough.

Now, from the technical aspect.
I'm not fully aware of the rewards implementation details and learn it  just by watching komodo explorer and trying to understand how it works, so don't shoot me if I'm wrong :)


I see that sometimes inputs are bigger than outputs (positive fee). While in other cases outputs are bigger than the inputs (explorer actually interpret it as negative fee...). 

Let's start with the first case (positive fee).This one should be simple.
In this case there are no rewards for this input address and just like btc, miner does: inputs - outputs = miners fee.

[13-Dec-19 01:17 AM] artik123#2884
.
Now the second case ("negative fee").
So from what I understand is that if:
x - inputs
y - calculated rewards for this input address
z - fee

Alice sends total outputs as sum equals to x + y - z and the miner just calculate (x+y) - {total outputs, which are actually x+y-z} and extracts the difference (z) for himself. Am I right?

So in case of "negative fee" it is actually ambiguous where the fee is taken from (Inputs or rewards) and it is up to our definition...

If so, then we can say that for any tx that has "negative fee" which is practical use, the fee is already taken from the reward!

If all that I have written above is true... 
(which may not be the case...)
Then in my opinion the marketing team should say as follows: "for any real world practical use, fees are taken from the rewards(interest) and not from balance. In other cases (when there is no reward) it will be taken from the balance."

Maybe someone else will find better wording than me. Hehe
