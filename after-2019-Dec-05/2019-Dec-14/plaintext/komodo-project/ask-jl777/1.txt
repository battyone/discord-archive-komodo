Would the stablecoin be abuseable? I‚Äôm not the smartest so please don‚Äôt roast me if I‚Äôm completely off the mark here üòÖ

No fees, and 80% creation of coin. I presume 20% is the safety net / in case coin drops in value the cc will liquidate the holdings? If not then my whole theory is wrong. 

If that is how it works though, say I have $10,000 I want to invest into kmd. Kmd is currently at $1

Option 1: I buy 10,000kmd like normal 

Option 2: I buy 10,000kmd, issue myself $8000 in stablecoins. If komodo rises, ie goes to say $5, I still only repay $10,000 to claim back 10,000kmd so no loss (minus tx fees)

However if komodo drops to say 80c, then my coins will be liquidated and I have $8000 in a stablecoin (holding 10,000kmd would have resulted in $8000 net position)
; but if komodo drops further say to 50c, either the liquidation will have stopped me from losing the funds, or if it doesn‚Äôt work that way, I could choose to keep the $8000 instead of paying it back to claim 10,000kmd as 10k kmd = $5000, and not paying back the deposit is the better option financially

> No fees, and 80% creation of coin. I presume 20% is the safety net / in case coin drops in value the cc will liquidate the holdings?
true. but, it is another user who will liquidate your holdings for a 5%(if instantly sold at market price) profit

> I buy 10,000kmd, issue myself $8000 in stablecoins. If komodo rises, ie goes to say $5, I still only repay $10,000 to claim back 10,000kmd so no loss (minus tx fees)
you only have to repay $8000 to get back your 10,000 KMD if price goes up

> However if komodo drops to say 80c, then my coins will be liquidated and I have $8000 in a stablecoin (holding 10,000kmd would have resulted in $8000 net position)
this is what happens

> if komodo drops further say to 50c
it doesn't affect you as your KMD have already been liquidated

> Would the stablecoin be abuseable?
it isn't abuse if someone uses something as it is intended. What you described is the intended behavior

by borrowing against the KMD collateral, you are giving up the right for its future gain, in exchange for not having to absorb future loss. also, to participate in the system, you give control of the collateral to the blockchain. unlike all the other stablecoin systems i know of, there is no interest to pay for the loan against the collateral. you do give up the right to claim the KMD rewards for the duration. also, not aware of any other system that uses a purely decentralized process to issue new stablecoins. anybody at anytime is able to deposit KMD and issue pegged coins

if you take out a loan on a car and it gets repossessed, then you wont get anything out of that. the repo man does

[13-Dec-19 12:38 PM] bishop#9773
Wouldn't the forgone rewards be considered one of the "costs" of the loan? In a loan situation, where do the rewards go? Never accrue? Back to the network?

[13-Dec-19 12:39 PM] bishop#9773
or do they accrue to 30 days and then once the loan is repaid, you get your capped rewards?

[13-Dec-19 12:39 PM] gcharang#6833
in the current implementation, rewards are used to fund the servers for the multisig signers

the rewards are 5% for a year
if you want to hold KMD and still get some fiat for a temperory emergency, you can use the peg
after the emergency is over, and you have the fiat, you get back the KMD

this way, you will escape from the volatility cost that will affect you if you sold and bought

[13-Dec-19 03:51 PM] joe2x4#5987
How many versions of stable coin concepts did you ponder before settling on this current concept? Has this concept been reviewed by any third party math and economics wizards? (Note: Am not questioning Jl777s intuitiveness and ingeniousness)

[13-Dec-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i cant count how many different concepts my subconscious ponders...

[13-Dec-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the math is pretty straightforward. and in the event of a catastrophic and immediate crash in KMD price, the peg will stretch. and the shortfall will be socialized across all issuers equally. meaning the market price of EURK will likely drop to a proportionate value of the overall equity levels.

[13-Dec-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
under normal bear market conditions, there is time for the liquidators to rebalance the overall exposure. its just if the price crashes so fast and we end up with negative equity situation for accounts. as to the probability of such a fast crash without recovery is... i doubt anybody can predict as it is an unpredictable event that is needed

[13-Dec-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the design can handle a 90% loss of value over a 6 month period, followed by another

[13-Dec-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but if the price drops 60%+ in a day... that would be hard to prevent going negative equity for accounts that only had 20% equity

this might be a dumb question because I havent read the documentation but to do this do you need to have a full running node?

[13-Dec-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
at first, yes. but we plan to enable CC over nSPV, then a superlite client will be able to do all the stablecoin operations

How far along is the enabling of CC over nSPV?

[13-Dec-19 07:13 PM] jspook16#3059
damn, look at what komodo has become since the days of ico.... crazy

[13-Dec-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
@allbits, we have done simple CC calls over nSPV

[13-Dec-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the complex ones will take a while longer as we are still finalizing the last of the foundational CC

once FSM CC is done, then it allows deploying new CC logic, without a new chain. almost as flexible as ETH smartcontracts, but of course with all the benefits of antara

[13-Dec-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to get this completed and verify we can transform the existing CC to an instance of FSM

[13-Dec-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
then we will know what exactly needs to be supported over nSPV. I dont expect any surprises between now and then, but nothing like having a concrete set of things to know for sure

[13-Dec-19 07:30 PM] jspook16#3059
Assuming Komodo becomes dominant in the market, do you plan to stay anonymous till the end?

[13-Dec-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

Maybe one should think about using formal verification of each new FSM instance in order to avoid risk of infinite loops
