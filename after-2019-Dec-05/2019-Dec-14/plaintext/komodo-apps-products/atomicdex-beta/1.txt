Hi
Who can I talk about listing on Atomic Dex?

[13-Dec-19 12:25 AM] jspook16#3059
@Semptly  you can probably start with @ca333

Thank you!

Any plans for Nano support on atomicDEX?

[13-Dec-19 02:28 AM] lost_souls_club#8354
Probably would be hard to code as I presume the architecture is quite different from BTC or ERC tokens.

But if there is no fatal flaw hiding it seems like a really good crypto sans privacy.

iOS AtomicDEX 0.2.8

@antropov083 the coins will return to you automatically in about 4 hours time
the app needs to be open or in background

if they don't come back automatically, you will see a button to initiate the refund

Hi, I can't make a single trade on atomicDex beta, all my trade are stuck at step 0/3 "Order matching". I even tried to accept my own trade offer, it doesn't work.

[13-Dec-19 08:15 PM] phm87#7395
@BlockTech you can t trade with yourself, it is not possible. I had to setup 2 mm2 to be able to trade with myself (2 different passphrases)

[13-Dec-19 08:18 PM] BlockTech#6895
ok thanks, but even with other offers it doesn't work. Still 0/3 on Order matching and doesn't moove from here. If i leave the orders window without closing the app, it even delete the current order i'm trying to do like it never happend.

[13-Dec-19 08:26 PM] BlockTech#6895
I'm trying to do KMD <-> VRSC (1 just worked, but the other 20 i tried failed and desappeared, don't know why).

[13-Dec-19 08:31 PM] BlockTech#6895
Maybe it's just my orderbook that's out of date. And i'm seeing old offers the app can't match.
