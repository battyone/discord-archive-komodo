Later I skipped around and came across one of his older tweets.

It reminded me the idea of whitelabel dex.

I think that Komodo is positioned better than any other cryptocurrency for dex democratization.

And by listening to an interview I happen to see that it is a real pain point since smaller cex's doesn't have the resources to secure themselves as well as the bigger guys.

Merely sending a transaction that meets certain rules allows you to earn this reward. Staking requires you to actively produce a block. These are completely different things. The user rewards don't ""come from"" x or y, they are created with the transaction at the time of the transaction. The amount that users get as a reward does not exist before the user gets the reward. The rewards are created by the protocol as a form of emission.","",""
