If you perform a tx with KMD, if you wanted few hours/days before moving/sending the coin, you won't pay tx fees (and you gain some tiny amounts because the active user reward is above tx fee). In some cases, the KMD user won't claim his active user reward (ledger users that don't use the special tool to claim rewards) then the value will go in the tx fees for miners (miners will gain this amount not claimed)","",""

@CoinKing88 Part of the problem with you understanding how it works is not understanding the terminology behind it and the terminology you are using.
There is no staking in KMD.
KMD does have a ""usage reward"" where you get a bonus reward for *using* it.
Merely sending a transaction that meets certain rules allows you to earn this reward.
Staking requires you to actively produce a block.
These are completely different things.
The user rewards don't ""come from"" x or y, they are created with the transaction at the time of the transaction.
The amount that users get as a reward does not exist before the user gets the reward.
The rewards are created by the protocol as a form of emission.","",""
