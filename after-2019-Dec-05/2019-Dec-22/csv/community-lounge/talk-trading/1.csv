If BTC drops it will eventually rise. Doesn't that make TA in sat value very vulnerable because it only tells half the story? For example in the chart there is a big ""supply zone"" in august and september where the sat price stays stable in that area, yet BTC dropped 20%, so KMD price dropped 20% in USD yet on your graph it shows a stable picture.","",""
