"474206298427097099","ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004","21-Dec-19 12:42 PM","the key is not to confuse or conflate atomicdex the GUI with atomicdex/mm2 the system
listing in the system, and being available to any GUI maker, is in fact free (there's an entire repo dedicated just for usable coins and their use params)
however, this ""official"" GUI is under a different structure and the team charges for things they don't have a vested interest in having on there","",""

"448777271701143562","smk762#7640","21-Dec-19 03:31 PM","Confirming mm2 compatibility is quite simple, and there are a few open source options and great docs for anyone wanting to. With much open source tools available, it's fair enough for developers to add a cost to further development, and given the docs available, for other projects to do their own development if they have the capability. 
Look at the ecosystem projects which have been around for a while (like LABS/PIRATE).  Apart from having a well defined use case, they do thier own dev, and often also contribute / participate within other ecosystem projects.
Komodo has so many modules that are language agnostic that one bloke, with enough time and motivation, can build a few things in their spare time while working a day job (as long as they are prepared to ignore passive recreation like watching TV etc). Basically it boils down to: do you want to learn and build, or do you want to pay someone else?","","💯 (3)"
