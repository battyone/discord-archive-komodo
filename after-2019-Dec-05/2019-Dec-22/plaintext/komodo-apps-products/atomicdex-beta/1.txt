[21-Dec-19 03:14 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe it was a smash and grab

[21-Dec-19 04:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
not  sure how they  got  on Adex

[21-Dec-19 04:30 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
thought it was an inside position and was going to   get yuge

@Oszy They wasnt able to pay for antara service. i guess its too expensive for hoppy projects.

[21-Dec-19 11:48 AM] Mark81#4505
One quiet moment. @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ We maded to 10 million club but never got on to shore.

[21-Dec-19 11:49 AM] Mark81#4505
why this keeps happening all to projects that touch kmd platform?

[21-Dec-19 11:49 AM] Mark81#4505

Happens to most projects in general

[21-Dec-19 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not just kmd üôÇ

[21-Dec-19 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you look at the hyped projects of 2017/2018 most of them no longer around

`why this keeps happening all to projects that touch kmd platform?`
because, "Joe Average" cannot afford the corporate-level prices?

[21-Dec-19 12:26 PM] Mark81#4505
Its slso joe averages that invest into these projects. Now they must be kicking them selves that coin is delisted. And same time a lot of coins get atomicdex support for free.

[21-Dec-19 12:35 PM] Mark81#4505
Wouldnt it be easier to get kmd name out with low level entry to it? Of course there must be costs to kmd team with rented hardware from AWS but could that market be decentralized to users providing base layers for such service and get paid from that?

[21-Dec-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the key is not to confuse or conflate atomicdex the GUI with atomicdex/mm2 the system
listing in the system, and being available to any GUI maker, is in fact free (there's an entire repo dedicated just for usable coins and their use params)
however, this "official" GUI is under a different structure and the team charges for things they don't have a vested interest in having on there

[21-Dec-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
imo, the system and the "reference/official GUI" should never have the same name (but I said this with "BarterDEX" too ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

[21-Dec-19 01:02 PM] CoinKing88#1540
It is confusing i agree, i would like to see the mm2 system to be named to something like DEX Market Maker 2.0 or something and let the GUI Atomic DEX stay the same (has made some name for itself now).

[21-Dec-19 01:03 PM] CoinKing88#1540
If it confuses people, you lose business

[21-Dec-19 03:31 PM] smk762#7640
Confirming mm2 compatibility is quite simple, and there are a few open source options and great docs for anyone wanting to. With much open source tools available, it's fair enough for developers to add a cost to further development, and given the docs available, for other projects to do their own development if they have the capability. 
Look at the ecosystem projects which have been around for a while (like LABS/PIRATE).  Apart from having a well defined use case, they do thier own dev, and often also contribute / participate within other ecosystem projects.
Komodo has so many modules that are language agnostic that one bloke, with enough time and motivation, can build a few things in their spare time while working a day job (as long as they are prepared to ignore passive recreation like watching TV etc). Basically it boils down to: do you want to learn and build, or do you want to pay someone else?
