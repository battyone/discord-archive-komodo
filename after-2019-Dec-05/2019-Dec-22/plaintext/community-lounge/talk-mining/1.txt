Is there a guide to staking KMD on the new platform 6.5

KMD the coin/chain doesn't have staking (never has)

Komodo 5% Active User Reward - All You Need to Know
What is the 5% Active User Reward?     Any Komodo address holding an unspent transaction output (UTXO) of value greater than 10 KMD will begin earning a¬†reward once the lock time is set about 1 hour after a transaction that creates the UTXO is mi...

How about that 5% annual staking reward, how does that work then?

[21-Dec-19 04:05 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Who pays that KMD? Miners or dev fund?

[21-Dec-19 04:08 PM] phm87#7395
I think that it is printed out of thin air

[21-Dec-19 04:09 PM] jorian#4555
math üòÑ

[21-Dec-19 04:13 PM] phm87#7395
I see the KMD active user reward as a negative transaction fee. If you perform a tx with KMD, if you wanted few hours/days before moving/sending the coin, you won't pay tx fees (and you gain some tiny amounts because the active user reward is above tx fee). In some cases, the KMD user won't claim his active user reward (ledger users that don't use the special tool to claim rewards) then the value will go in the tx fees for miners (miners will gain this amount not claimed)

[21-Dec-19 04:21 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I still don't understand it. Where does the KMD i claim come from? There is a fixed supply of 200M of which 110M is mined and in circulation. I hold amount x, who pays for my extra 5% * X?

[21-Dec-19 04:22 PM] phm87#7395
it is added to the circulation and it comes from nowhere (thin air) or math. If someone wants to have some KMD, he can mine it on a pool or he can claim his reward regularly. Both are new coins added to circulation

[21-Dec-19 04:22 PM] phm87#7395
there is no KMD fund or miner fund that pays the active user reward

[21-Dec-19 04:23 PM] phm87#7395
the current supply is changing, it can be calculated

[21-Dec-19 04:23 PM] phm87#7395
but due to this active user reward, it should be calculated based on blockchain

[21-Dec-19 04:24 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So its written in the protocol that every moment somebody claims rewards a portion of the tokens that a not mined yet come into circulation without mining?

[21-Dec-19 04:24 PM] phm87#7395
yes sth like this

[21-Dec-19 04:25 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Does it affect mining rewards or are they 2 seperate processes?

[21-Dec-19 04:28 PM] phm87#7395
that's what I tried to explain here above, these 2 processes are not separated, your guess is right

[21-Dec-19 04:29 PM] phm87#7395
if the user funds are eligible to claim their reward, user moves funds but without claiming (it can happen using ledger or similar devices if you don't use the proper tool), then the unclaimed reward is added to Komodo reward for the miner (or the notary node)

[21-Dec-19 04:30 PM] phm87#7395
Notary nodes are mining KMD blocks, around 75% of blocks. About 25% of blocks are mined by equihash mining pools

[21-Dec-19 04:30 PM] phm87#7395
if you search through the KMD explorer, you'll see some blocks with higher block rewards

`How about that 5% annual staking reward, how does that work then?`
@CoinKing88 Part of the problem with you understanding how it works is not understanding the terminology behind it and the terminology you are using.
There is no staking in KMD.
KMD does have a "usage reward" where you get a bonus reward for *using* it.
Merely sending a transaction that meets certain rules allows you to earn this reward.
Staking requires you to actively produce a block.
These are completely different things.
The user rewards don't "come from" x or y, they are created with the transaction at the time of the transaction.
The amount that users get as a reward does not exist before the user gets the reward.
The rewards are created by the protocol as a form of emission.

Allright, i learned a little bit again today üôÇ
