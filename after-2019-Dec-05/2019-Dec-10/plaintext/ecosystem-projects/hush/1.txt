[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This was a big week for us

[09-Dec-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi yes it was!

[09-Dec-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I just merged really important code for the DragonHead to our hush3.git `dev` branch, too. Week isn't over yet

[09-Dec-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No, no it's not over yet

[09-Dec-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also busy merging a huge amount of updates from KMD 0.5.0 release

[09-Dec-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Nice

[09-Dec-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Ethereum just had a hardfork

[09-Dec-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And I think it included some code, to make Ethereum & ZCash work together

[09-Dec-19 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Interesting stuff

[09-Dec-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> wallet updates,
SilentDragon v0.8.3
SilentDragonLite 1.1.3

[09-Dec-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no, it's not to make ETH+ZEC work together

[09-Dec-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's that ETH is adopting the internals of ZEC

[09-Dec-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zk-snarks

[09-Dec-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zero knowledge math

[09-Dec-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they are not trying to make ETH + ZEC "work together" but many of the researchers in zk-world are doing ETH stuff lately

[09-Dec-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But they do seem very friendly, tbh

[09-Dec-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ZCash trying to get into DeFi

[09-Dec-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is a large overlap between JPMorgan, Zcash Foundation and Ethereum people

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They're doing some ZKSnarks stuff

[09-Dec-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's individual uses for this or that

[09-Dec-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They like the technology

[09-Dec-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hush price isn't boring lol

[09-Dec-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> price is way oversold haha

[09-Dec-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> but the price is boring in terms of increase

[09-Dec-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Dec-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> How do u figure?

[09-Dec-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> what do you think about the price? Coin is waaaaaayy undervalued

[09-Dec-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Very undervalued

[09-Dec-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But still doing well.m

[09-Dec-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Look at ARRR and VRSC

[09-Dec-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> arrr is relatively new. and ATH/current price ratio is not a lot compared with our pirce

[09-Dec-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> price*

[09-Dec-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Exactly

[09-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We are kicking aise

[09-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> lol not in terms of price üòõ

[09-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And look at how much we have done, since we moved onto the new chain

[09-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> yeah we have major improvements in tech

[09-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We damn near 3x, in 2 weeks in November

[09-Dec-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And we have held that price

[09-Dec-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It wasn't a pump

[09-Dec-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And dump

[09-Dec-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It pumped and it has held up

[09-Dec-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> we'll see how it goes

[09-Dec-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We will see how it goes when we drop this new BCT ANN

[09-Dec-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> bct?

[09-Dec-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bitcointalk

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Miners gonna mine

[09-Dec-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You'll see kek

[09-Dec-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> what I don't get is that the hush trading volume on graviex higher is then what they show at coinmarketcap

[09-Dec-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> CMC is wrong with the data or Graviex is not projecting the right volume

[09-Dec-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Oh really?

[09-Dec-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That can be addressed

[09-Dec-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Sup ladies

[09-Dec-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> sup mate

[09-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain CMC shows the volume of all exchanges, Graviex is just showing the volume of *their* exchange

[09-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, there is a data lag,  CMCprobably only updates every few hours, since they support so many coins+exchanges

As the global war on cash escalates so does the need for an alternative.

‚ÄúGreeks will be hit with a hefty fine if they do not spend almost a third of their income electronically... Individuals that fail to meet the target will be hit with a 22% fine‚Äù

[09-Dec-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 22% fine or just buy Bitcoin?

[09-Dec-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Dec-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> somebody study that for me, plz

[09-Dec-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 ^

[09-Dec-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mobile app which is a btc full node and has lite mode support and LN support

[09-Dec-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c this is almost a competitor to nSPV/superlite, or close to it. Interesting code that might have some nice things KMD ecosystem can emulate

[09-Dec-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I will have a look, thank you

[09-Dec-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Warning: for many btc maximalists, I am the puppet of jl777 while many lizards think that I am manipulated by blockstream. Fun is that in reality, I strongly disagree most of the time with jl777 and blockstream.

[09-Dec-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 that means you are doing things right, if both sides dislike you üòâ

[09-Dec-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 and we welcome you with warm arms in the Hush community

[09-Dec-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Thanks a lot buddy. I feel good in Hush community (open minded guys)

[09-Dec-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @phm87 I have no prejudice towards you on my side. (Except that you are the king of the #off_tropic channel :shush: üòâ )

[09-Dec-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> But whatever I disagree with both sides (jl777 and bitcoiners), I continue to discuss a lot, both sides help me but indeed, I feel that some ppl dislike me at both sides. Honestly, I like to discuss and disagree, it helps to learn

[09-Dec-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> In most conversations, I learn more to discuss with people who don t agree with me

[09-Dec-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a good talent

[09-Dec-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio i put a fix in `dev` branch

[09-Dec-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it compiles, so it must work!

[09-Dec-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> doing a full sync test on a faster machine now, on latest `dev` branch

[09-Dec-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yay, it's syncing
