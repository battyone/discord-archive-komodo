that only works if winning doesn't require consolidation (which we did in the past)

[09-Dec-19 12:14 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
once consolidated, all txes can be tracked back to 1 and/or 2 (in which case the cheat becomes obvious)

[09-Dec-19 01:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
12 UTC?

[09-Dec-19 01:11 AM] smk762#7640
time for phase 2 not yet set

CFEKPOS64 chain seems to be okay now, looks like there was no fork, but too many orphan blocks due to stakes competing with each other on every block

I thinkI uncommented a dumb thing in my  conf

[09-Dec-19 05:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
Quick question @LabsAssistant  can i just drop my config.ini into a fresh StakedNotary clone and go on or is there more to it?

[09-Dec-19 05:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
My node is busted since the competition

[09-Dec-19 05:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
and last time a clean didnt help... and had a hell of a time redoinf it from scratch

[09-Dec-19 05:41 PM] phm87#7395
Iguana port to open ? Maybe I forget something

[09-Dec-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
Might take this opportunity to use 18.04

[09-Dec-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
the firewall script is there

[09-Dec-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
is based off assets json

I had issues on my kmdlabs notary node because I used an unknown key. When mylo gave me his key, it should work but it did not. Many guys helped me.
Finally, it began to work after a rpc call (unlock wallet).
On a new server with fresh install, I did not had this issue anymore

[09-Dec-19 05:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
good info ty

[09-Dec-19 05:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
going to spin up an 18.04 and try to get this up today

this is prob the tamest of the shit posted in my WoW guild's NSFW channel

_sees no fork_

[09-Dec-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
spent a few hours yesterday trying to figure out why it was forking

[09-Dec-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
am pretty convinced it was people running with testnode=1

[09-Dec-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't make sense otherwise

[09-Dec-19 06:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
Start a new 100% chain... give params to NN and just enough coin to notarize for 400 blocks... and only POS on your nodes. Make notarypay 1 sat so no one can POS with you... its a test chain so NN wont care about it being 1 sat of fake coin.

[09-Dec-19 06:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
then send competitors som staking weight on segid0 to do a confirm run before opening the competition. Set a blockheight for comp start.

[09-Dec-19 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
there is an issue with using KMDLabs/komodo right now

[09-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
need to use komodoplatform/komodo, and it's *really* annoying to get this to work with StakedNotary

[09-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
Joker basically sabotaged this contest by being belligerent and argumentative instead of trying to help

[09-Dec-19 06:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
i happen to be compiling that master branch on my staking node right now

I'll try to sync with other komodod. ...it kind of makes sense....

[09-Dec-19 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im not crazy, you asked me to make a CFEK chain... That means its LABS, if you wanted to test KomodoPlatform stuff you should have said that..

[09-Dec-19 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I spent 3 days redoing StakedNotary into LabsNotary to fix all the stupid bugs it had, and even had a chain up with a pool ready to go.

[09-Dec-19 11:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
I think a lot of us went on min to no sleep over the weekend... we should better prepare for contests.

[09-Dec-19 11:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
I was typing up omething earlier but deleted it... maybe worthwhile to put it out there anyways...

[09-Dec-19 11:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
As NN ops for LABS and competition participants, i think we need to draft a set of rules for these contests...

[09-Dec-19 11:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
Not rules for competitors...

[09-Dec-19 11:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
Rules for the devs, preparing whats needed, minimum time before each step leading to the competitions...

[09-Dec-19 11:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
lay out exactly what we require, give each step a minimum amount of time to announce and set up, then a defined time gap of readiness until the competition starts

[09-Dec-19 11:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
Just a basic guidelines and SOP for getting ready so we can rinse repeat and the new participants can see we have our shit together

[09-Dec-19 11:44 PM] daemonfox#6136

[09-Dec-19 11:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
^^^ but better defned

[09-Dec-19 11:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
we as NN ops should be held accountable to NOT be dicks before the competition starts...

[09-Dec-19 11:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
and we can easily do that

[09-Dec-19 11:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
some can :troll_lol:

[09-Dec-19 11:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
@blackjok3r  if you feel its worthwhile... my node is dead... gotta redo it anyways... id like to give your repo a try... iim not scared lol I already emptied by NN balances

[09-Dec-19 11:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
being a bit of a dick myself but I had to share... WWJL777D

[09-Dec-19 11:55 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
everything I have touched has  broken  this week  -- I can break something else with no problem --- I am not  scared   ----Im not even a NN op and I am a dick  too!!... Admiting it is the first step

[09-Dec-19 11:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol not gonna scare us off easily no sir!
