[29-Dec-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> actually yes, but on HyperDex you will see it - in the future this will be optimized (re @Suzycrabgrass: Also, I can't see the order book without loading funds? Is that correct?)

[29-Dec-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Why would anyone use atomic dex if it's not as user friendly? (re @Acura360: actually yes, but on HyperDex you will see it - in the future this will be optimized)
