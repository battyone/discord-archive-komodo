Seems like I've been missing a big conversation.

The above summary of your though has some good ideas worth implementing, imo, @artik123 .

With the goal of having your ideas provide true benefit I have a question.

I'm curious, what are you going to contribute (**do**) to start putting these ideas into practice?

---
Here is an example of what I mean:

I also would like to see more people build on the modules.  I recognize that for many devs this can may take more resources and skills they have at the moment.

As steps towards having more people start building on the platform I have been actively approaching both projects that have the resources and devs that have the motivation to start working on this.  There have been enough minor successes to continue down this path.

Also, I have found that actively participating in testing and using the various tools has given me the chance to see some of my (small) suggestions implemented.

My technical skills are very low, but even so I have found many areas where I am able to **do** things that contribute towards seeing my ideas becoming reality.
---

I'm not suggesting that this is the path you should take.  Just giving an example of **do**ing what my current skills and situation allow to see my ideas bring concrete results.

With your technical skills I imagine that your contributions would bring everyone great benefit, as your ideas are realized.

Although I shouldn't be replying in this channel I felt a strong need to.  Apologies ðŸ™‡

I'll head over to #dev-general after suggesting that others, who are interested, follow the full discussion in the other channels.

@CrisF My situation is very unique (i don't wish to elaborate more on that). In the past I have made a project or two for this community and also been a x4 notary node operator for a year and a half. If these ideas go through, it's worth x100 more than I could ever possibly do.

[29-Dec-19 03:25 AM] artik123#2884
Business development is not considered **do**ing?

[29-Dec-19 03:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Understand, and remember seeing you as a NN.
Would like to see `how, who, what, etc`. Not expecting big ideas like that to be done by one person.
Yes, business dev is not just ideas and thoughts though.  It's also putting them into action by making a concrete plan, implementing those plans, etc.
I'm very curious on your ideas on implementation and am willing to put some time into  this.

Let's first wait for jl response

[29-Dec-19 03:31 AM] CrisF#3405
I saw that he, and others, have responded in the other channels where this was discussed.

[29-Dec-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you put words into my mouth, as we do not want to have 100s of CC core devs, we want to make the reference implementations and show what is possible.

[29-Dec-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
also there is nothing that prevents a solidity CC, other than the relatively large amount of work it would take

[29-Dec-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and i have nothing against such middleware

[29-Dec-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
also, i will repeat that the marketing guys are working on getting consulting companies up to speed along with our training docs so that projects can hire a CC dev when they need one. realistically a funded project will need a spectrum of resources, including a CC dev (relatively small amount of work), GUI dev (more work), systems, etc. so i dont think the problem is the funded projects

[29-Dec-19 06:01 AM] Mylo#8306
this is the key, _a funded company_ that is producing a new service.   they'll be looking to implement some customization.  this funded company / start up will have maybe one or two coders that know what they are doing, will need to get up to speed or get assistance.

it's the same model parity uses with substrate.  it's all a timing (when ICO was) & budget (bear market) related thing.  all the pieces are in place, are still being built etc.

another 6-12 months, plenty more tech to build on & a flagship GUI trading network (atomicdex api) with the flagship security application (dpow) which offers an IoT solution with nSPV.

[29-Dec-19 06:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it is clear that steps are being taken to this end.  
The amount of docs and resources for developers and users have exploded over the last year!
Been doing what I can and am glad to find other things that I can do to maximize my usefulness.

[29-Dec-19 06:02 AM] Mylo#8306
the stablecoin solution is another interesting fintech innovation for the ecosystem.

[29-Dec-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
any project would be able to launch their own algorithmic stablecoin, via commandline and no coding

[29-Dec-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i am wrong, but that seems to be a unique thing

to put into perspective the bear market ðŸ‘†

[29-Dec-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and it is an example of bash scripts + existing CC being able to do what otherwise needs a lot of coding

`solidity CC`

[29-Dec-19 06:10 AM] artik123#2884
@CrisF If it would be on a virtual machine, with an account based contracts then yes.

[29-Dec-19 06:11 AM] CrisF#3405
What would the first step in getting that done be?
