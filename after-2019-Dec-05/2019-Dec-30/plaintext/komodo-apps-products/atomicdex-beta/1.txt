its not recommended to use same address on multiple devices

@smk762 wasn't going to actively trade on both, just wanted to use one to generate/verify the passphrase. Thanks for the heads up.

Will there be any benefits for $kmd in the atomic dex?

[29-Dec-19 08:15 AM] Panho#7078
In the Atomic dex the beneficiary is the DEX coin, 1,000,000 pcs - part of the Komodo ecosystem

@jl777c Can you say roughly when and how much the next dividend will be?

[29-Dec-19 11:18 AM] hastrup#8742
@wolzie you can watch it yourself :)

When the Addy have around 1 mil in usd they will be paid out to asset holders

[29-Dec-19 11:26 AM] wolzie#2866
It's a little complicated for me. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[29-Dec-19 11:37 AM] Bitfinger#6245
@wolzie when the DEX address above holds $1mil worth of crypto, it will be sold for KMD and each DEX will receive $1 worth of KMD. As far as I've understood it.

[29-Dec-19 11:43 AM] wolzie#2866
@Bitfinger $1, okay. Thank you. 
Is it possible to calculate, if things continue as they are, when that will be, roughly at what intervals?

[29-Dec-19 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@wolzie this might help explain: <https://webworker.sh/assetchains>

[29-Dec-19 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there is no real way to tell "roughly at what intervals", value happens when it happens

[29-Dec-19 02:45 PM] Bitfinger#6245
@wolzie as CG says, it is difficult to tell at the moment. The USD price of each crypto affects the overall value and atomic dex is still in beta, one would expect things to pick up once we move out the test phase

[29-Dec-19 02:58 PM] richardt#2807
It'll most likely happen at the top of a bull market. So whenever that is üòâ
