Hi  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢, yeah that's the process I'm interested in :) which app are you referring to? I did this with Agama before but then I couldn't keep the coins in my ledger. I wish them to remain there

are the apps folks seem to use
I've never owned one so I don't have any advice to offer as to which is better 🤷🏽‍♂️
