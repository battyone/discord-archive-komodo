most difficult thing in the world is the platform business. 
I admit that blockchain is needed to break the absurdity of the existing platform business monopolized by a company, but at least no one will use it without logic to convince consumers of it. 
exactly balancing demand and supply is the core of the platform, and frankly I dare not imagine how difficult it would be to maintain that balance without easy control. 
reality is that even strongly and strategically controlled platforms are going to collapse.

I believe #Bitcoin got swallowed by the fiat system when it became an Industry. Its revolution was quietly, neatly bribed and tribed into alignment.
#Bitcoin didn't fail though. It simply didn't (and probably won't) take us all the way on its own.
I believe anon coins will.
