Happy New year!!!
I'm very proud of the Komodo Team.
I gained even more respect, if that was possible, for
how the Agama Hack was handled--during & after.
AtomicDex, too!!!!!

[01-Jan-20 09:58 PM] c2k#4915
does anyone know if dexstats is still functional or is there just something wrong with the site?

[01-Jan-20 10:00 PM] phm87#7395
it should work, sometimes one explorer is down but most part of the websites are working fine each time I need it

[01-Jan-20 10:01 PM] phm87#7395
mmhhh whitepage on the homepage from my computer now ... maybe the mm2 feature added by @CHMEX are using too much ressources

[01-Jan-20 10:01 PM] c2k#4915

@CHMEX About mm2 data, how do you retrieve it ?
If you use the dexfee address RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf, you may overestimate the number of swaps (some failed swaps already paid the dexfee). If you use Alright scripts, it can be fine (if you restrict the swaps counts to swaps with dexfee paid, otherwize, you'd take into account swaps of other DEX'es)

[01-Jan-20 10:33 PM] c2k#4915
anyoen know if OURC is still alive or no?

[01-Jan-20 10:36 PM] c2k#4915
and ZEXO too...anyone know if that alive or dead?

[01-Jan-20 10:45 PM] cipi#4502
@phm87 the data is from the seed nodes (json-files of MAKER and TAKER stored there)
i parse that data and write it into an SQL database
if one of the event types of the swap is of type `error_events`, the data is written into a separate table (for further analysis)

[01-Jan-20 10:47 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you, I though that dexstats was using Alright's script (I'm reading it but I'm poor at python)
