@mrlynch yes I can configure it in 32 or 64 bits but I installed the 64 bits preimage of ubuntu and I did some config to be sure that it runs in 64 bits. I tried your command:
```uname -a
Linux ubuntu 5.3.0-1014-raspi2 #16-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 26 11:18:23 UTC 2019 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux``` I was able to run, sync and stake WLC21, then I synced LABS on a external hard drive. I wonder if I can compile and launch mm2 on such device, it can be cool

does dexstats not work anymore or is there an issue with the site?
