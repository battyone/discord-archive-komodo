let's say a trader doesn't want to let his/her app running in the background. I wonder if it can be done in a way that a trader send his coin to a smart contract that would automatically trade the trader's coin for the targeted coin once the smart contract found the right/lower price target? then automagically send the traded coin to the trader address

@Gordon Komodo who controls the smart contract address? Anything custodial then you have the AML/KYC issues

now my 10 test nodes are able to sustain 2000 tx/sec (capacity is 8192/sec)
CPU usage of 15% on a receiving only node, bandwidth between 2MB and 8MB/sec, using 1kb datablob size. RAM usage is whatever amount of data in an hour with a half GB overhead.

i think these are sufficient performance for DEX orderbook usage, assuming it can maintain this level of performance as the network size scales up.

[01-Jan-20 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind this is just the low level transport layer for the datablobs. it uses a fully decentralized p2p network and current tests show the datablobs are 99.99% in sync across the nodes. at this rate of order flow, the bandwidth usage was about 4MB/sec, with peaks of 12MB/sec. not that much for any decent bandwidth provider

[01-Jan-20 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if this survives a burn in test, then i will be ready to add an api wrapper for the querying of the datablobs. this can be used by mm2, or any other dapp that needs a mostly synchronized set of data across all nodes. think of it as a UDP level instead of TCP. so it will always be fast, just that if you oversaturate things, it will drop some packets

Hi everyone!

[01-Jan-20 07:25 PM] scott#5457
@kmdkrazy would love to chat with you about portis and Komodo

[01-Jan-20 07:25 PM] scott#5457
I hardly ever use discord- (feel free to chat with me on LinkedIn or TG.) I‚Äôll check back in a couple days on discord.

I know nothing and see nothing @scott

[01-Jan-20 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ongoing testing discussion for the decentralized orderbook is in #ask-jl777

[01-Jan-20 08:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
If you need a DEV for Portis MM2 integration or need to understand it more ...I suggest #dev-marketmaker  @scott

@CHMEX Hi. Happy new year!
Which scripts did you use about mm2 ? Alright's scripts ?

[01-Jan-20 09:15 PM] Alright#0419
he's using seed node data

[01-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
@phm87 working on that script right now, had to rewrite it entirely. Just pushed the initial version after the rewrite. Checking it against seed node data now

[01-Jan-20 09:17 PM] phm87#7395
If info is coming from blockchain itself, how to distinguish an atomicswap of atomicdex with a swap of another system ? You raised the question recently I think

[01-Jan-20 09:17 PM] Alright#0419

Does seem to work. Right now just grabbing and associating the txes. Making it grab useful info now

I will read, thank you

[01-Jan-20 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
possible this version would pick up other DEX protocols, but I really doubt it

[01-Jan-20 09:56 PM] hastrup#8742
@CHMEX wow that is amazing!

[01-Jan-20 09:57 PM] hastrup#8742
And happy new year to everyone üéâ
