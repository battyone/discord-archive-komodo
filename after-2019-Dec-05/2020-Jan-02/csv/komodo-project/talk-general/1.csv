I'm very proud of the Komodo Team.
I gained even more respect, if that was possible, for
how the Agama Hack was handled--during & after.
AtomicDex, too!!!!!","","KMD (6)"

If you use the dexfee address RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf, you may overestimate the number of swaps (some failed swaps already paid the dexfee). If you use Alright scripts, it can be fine (if you restrict the swaps counts to swaps with dexfee paid, otherwize, you'd take into account swaps of other DEX'es)","",""

i parse that data and write it into an SQL database
if one of the event types of the swap is of type `error_events`, the data is written into a separate table (for further analysis)","",""
