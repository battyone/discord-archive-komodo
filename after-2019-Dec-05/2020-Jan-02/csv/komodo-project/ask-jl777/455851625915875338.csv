Now, I‚Äôve read more of the ticket but not all, I have a question about the p2p orderbook and the order matching as separate items.

1) from my understanding that the orderbook data structure is an array that can be used by front ends, is the orderbook data structure (essentially a look up directory) re-usable in other real-time P2P data applications that are not orderbooks.  Can this be put on the roadmap?

2) the ordermatching is two parties agreeing to execute ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.  In the Dex app, a trade.  However in another P2P app it could execute another something, eg signal to open a comms channel with other software like VoIP - is the execution some data structure/protocol  instruction, eg json ?

3) going back to orderbook network, can a node connect to specific caretaker nodes like with -addnode or -connect?  This question is more related to (2) for uses in other apps rather than trading, but maybe it‚Äôs already doable with nSPV in the coins.json file?","",""

Something to ```circumvent the issue of having a single point of view (a single full node) to view the chain``` as mentioned in this article `https://medium.com/the-arcadia-media-group/building-lightweight-block-explorers-using-pokt-46baf668625e`?","",""
