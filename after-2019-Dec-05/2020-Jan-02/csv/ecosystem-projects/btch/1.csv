I don't think it's on any active exchanges currently unfortunately. Regarding Altsbit, when Hush was listed there, formerly known as digitalprice, they asked money to do simple wallet updates to keep the coin online(should be free since that's the way they generate money with transactions/trades) and just the way they handled things generally with Hush made it so that we have no interest to get BTCH or HUSH on altsbit/digitalprice currently.","",""
