Sometimes if unconfirmed output is reused the entire transaction chain gets stuck unconfirmed for long time. The b address is empty because MM2 refunded the payment in this tx: https://explorer.utrum.io/tx/90c9d04f6209825e2d42973e894d976cae0936514fd44cedd37fefac2359a449 The protocol failed because payment was unconfirmed, so refund has been issued after locktime expiration.
@smk762 @TonyL 
Have you experienced similar with unconfirmed transactions? Is there a way to workaround it?","",""

MM2 is designed to work with single UTXO without splits so it gets reused even unconfirmed to allow several concurrent swaps for the coin.

I see, maybe we should just wait and check how likely it will happen in the near future. If it happens rarely we can handle it manually, will not take much time for tech team.
