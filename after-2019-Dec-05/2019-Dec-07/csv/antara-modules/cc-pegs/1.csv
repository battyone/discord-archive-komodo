Note: Before depositing, make sure you have very low number of utxos in your wallet. Ideal to have 1 to 5 utxos. You can find how many utxos you have by issuing `listunspent` call on the source chain. If you have a lot of utxos, try consolidating them using `sendtoaddress` call to same wallet address before doing the `z_sendmany`. Otherwise, you might run into issues when importing them into destination chain. The daemon might complain with `bad-txns-opret-too-big`.

Too many stuff can go wrong and funds could be lost so only someone 100% sure what he is doong should be using it manually (this is for production). In GUI the consolidation of utxos can be done and whole deposit tx which is big will be on a button click.";"";"";
