There is a saying that the bank will give you an umbrella on a sunny day, but when the first drop of rain starts they will take it back. Some people get in trouble sometimes, and it's part if life.
Back to our issue. It doesn't always mean that when someone issued a loan he doesn't have the resources to repay it. It can also mean that at the time he wants to liquidate it he doesn't have them, and there is a big difference.

Regardless of what we spoke, I think that the ""close account"" option is in many cases a very convenient way to redeem a  loan. Even if he does have assets to redeem the loan, he wouldn't have to sell them in order to buy usdk to support the withdrawal (and then possibly to sell the kmd that they got to buy back the assets). It's just a hustle free option.

Without a ""closing account"" option, it could possibly lead to a systemic problem where, over time, more and more loans would never be redeemed and an ever-increasing amount of usdk will be floating around. I'm not sure what the consequences of it will be...";"";"";

This is the risk of putting up collateral.  It is secured credit, not a credit card.
CDPs are used for loans to get liquidity for other opportunities with the hope of making the effort worthwhile.

If you have a mortgage to 90% of the value of your house, and the market goes down by 20%, the lending policy of your mortgagors (lenders) may be to foreclose on your loan.  It is the way secured credit works for lower interest.

In this case it is 0% loan.

In the event of DGB falling in value, it is unfortunate market conditions and whatever the initial 5500USDK loan was used for hopefully was used for good opportunities to outweigh the liquidation of the smaller asset.  If the market is screwed, what else is there to do?  Ask for a bailout?";"";"";

But you will understand it very well when someone designs a GUI with lazy registration and low activation energy (no long EULA scrolling and no seed phrase to set at the registration... he could skip it if he wants and only get a friendly reminder after the user had experienced the app and feel comfortable) and take the market.";"";"";

And about having a loan in fiat baked on cryptos, I know few companies that make that. It have some risks (in case of market dump). Usually, ppl make that to buy real estate and pay way less taxes.";"";"";

in real life, if you make a loan with some collateral (real estate, company shares, cryptos, ...) for anything and you burn/loose the money, whatever any collateral gained value, bank will sell everything at a stupid price to get their money. In the case of KEUR, some math can't be worth than bank rules for selling your stuff. I know ppl who were seized for thousands of ‚Ç¨ for small unpaid bills of few hundreds because it is sold at very low price (but unpaid bills is a little bit different)";"";"";
