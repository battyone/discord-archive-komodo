we need to make the gui consolidate utxos to fit

[06-Dec-19 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
what if somebody has 100,000 utxo? do we need to make it work with that?

[06-Dec-19 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810
better to make sure user has a sane number of utxo for the deposit

[06-Dec-19 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, GUI consolidation of utxos would be good. 100,000 utxos sounds a lot ðŸ™‚

[06-Dec-19 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i didn't think 24 utxos would create issues. could consolidate them before depositing

[06-Dec-19 10:07 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll put the consolidate part in the guide

[06-Dec-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe that should be a standard thing to do, send to self desired amount + txfee

[06-Dec-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
then it will always just be one utxo

[06-Dec-19 11:30 AM] SHossain#0007
i added this on the guide
```
Note: Before depositing, make sure you have very low number of utxos in your wallet. Ideal to have 1 to 5 utxos. You can find how many utxos you have by issuing `listunspent` call on the source chain. If you have a lot of utxos, try consolidating them using `sendtoaddress` call to same wallet address before doing the `z_sendmany`. Otherwise, you might run into issues when importing them into destination chain. The daemon might complain with `bad-txns-opret-too-big`.

Basically, the best use of sidechains and pegs would be using GUI. Too many stuff can go wrong and funds could be lost so only someone 100% sure what he is doong should be using it manually (this is for production). In GUI the consolidation of utxos can be done and whole deposit tx which is big will be on a button click.

Thanks. yes, this would be a must to do for GUI

[06-Dec-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
did couple of withdraws, worked fine

[06-Dec-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
will deposit more

[06-Dec-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
also withdrawn my mined funds ðŸ˜›

[06-Dec-19 06:46 PM] SHossain#0007
queued 7 withdraws

[06-Dec-19 06:49 PM] SHossain#0007
seems all are working

[06-Dec-19 06:51 PM] SHossain#0007
the only current issue we know of is, msig address might run out of funds. txfee needs to be lowered or use 0 fee for txs. 0 fee should work fine as it works with KMD and other smartchains

[06-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Zero fee would be great
