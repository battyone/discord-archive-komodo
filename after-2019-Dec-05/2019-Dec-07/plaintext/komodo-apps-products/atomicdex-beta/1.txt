Is it going to be an app or something with charts representing the swaps and the orders on AtomicDex, like the exchanges have?

[06-Dec-19 05:34 AM] criptobear#6402
It would be massive to have the possibility to create an order directly on the chart

[06-Dec-19 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi! If your funds were locked in a failed swap you'll get it back eventually. Please note that if you're on iOS you need to keep the app opened / screen turned on for some time (mm2 can't work on this OS in background yet but it'll be improved in one of the coming updates)

@Torankoku it is in development

[06-Dec-19 05:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@Oszy sound notifications playing if you have maker order up or if you have swap in progress. Also there is custom notification on swap finishing.
 It was implemented mostly for iOS (will allow mm2 to work in background). In AtomicDEX settings you can minimize the sound volume of these notifications

[06-Dec-19 05:02 PM] Oszy#5734
Tony that is not the problem

[06-Dec-19 05:03 PM] Oszy#5734
On the coin activation screen, there is this coin drop sound, right?

[06-Dec-19 05:03 PM] Oszy#5734
and it doesn't ever stop playing

[06-Dec-19 05:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Coin drop sound playing non stop now if you have maker orders up

[06-Dec-19 05:04 PM] Oszy#5734
why?

[06-Dec-19 05:04 PM] Oszy#5734
just for ios?

[06-Dec-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe should have different behavior for iOs vs androind

[06-Dec-19 05:04 PM] Oszy#5734
if I mute the coin drop, I mute everything else

[06-Dec-19 05:05 PM] Oszy#5734
which i prefer not to

[06-Dec-19 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
To keep mm2 alive on iOS mainly. 
`maybe should have different behavior for iOs vs androind` sure - it's quite experimental feature and users feedback is important for the next patch üôÇ

[06-Dec-19 05:05 PM] Oszy#5734
take my feedback, it's annoying üòÑ and i'd still ike to hear the swap in progress sound

üìù 

[06-Dec-19 05:05 PM] Oszy#5734
so can't mute just one of them

[06-Dec-19 05:06 PM] Oszy#5734
i can hear it even if i switch it off in settings

[06-Dec-19 05:07 PM] Oszy#5734
how about that?

[06-Dec-19 05:07 PM] Oszy#5734
or that's not an off switch?

[06-Dec-19 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
"switch off" actually set volume level of it on like a 1/10

[06-Dec-19 05:08 PM] Oszy#5734
meh

[06-Dec-19 05:08 PM] Oszy#5734
ok.. so i have to mute my phone

[06-Dec-19 05:09 PM] Oszy#5734
men can't listen to spotify like this üòÑ nor when his media audio is muted because of the app üòÑ

[06-Dec-19 05:09 PM] Oszy#5734
no point keeping it in the background if it just annoys you

[06-Dec-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like we need to play sounds that are silent

[06-Dec-19 05:12 PM] TonyL#3577
yeah, we might disable it by default on Android and play silence when it turned off in setttings so mm2 will not die on iOS

thank you üôÇ

[06-Dec-19 05:15 PM] ca333#0118
for android we can certainly implement a "silent sound" - for iOS we simply can't. However, we can work out a sound/format that isn't annoying. Maybe being able to chose the sound will be an improvement: "Female with irish accents" vs. "Male with scotch accent", "Beeps", etc.

[06-Dec-19 05:15 PM] Oszy#5734
a beep every minute would still be less annoying than a continuous sound

[06-Dec-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant have a very low volume (close to inaudible) sound on iOs?

[06-Dec-19 05:18 PM] ca333#0118
you can - but the goal is to get the app approval from apple - so we had to declare the application as an app which needs sound-notifications (key-feature) since that is one of the few options we had to be able to keep the app running in the background. If there is no sound it will be interpreted as a bypass of the "no app can run in the background" rule - and that would bring us back to the old situation.

[06-Dec-19 05:19 PM] Oszy#5734
_so glad he sacked his iphone_

[06-Dec-19 05:19 PM] phm87#7395
Sounds above some frequency are not heard by adults (or very rarely). Sth above 20 kHz

[06-Dec-19 05:20 PM] Oszy#5734
only your dogs will go crazy üòÑ

[06-Dec-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
can you have sounds for some aspects that are normal, and just have a keep alive "sound" that is very low volume

[06-Dec-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
24khz at the lowest volume that is still a notification would indeed not be heard by most people

{Reactions}
üëç 

[06-Dec-19 05:23 PM] ca333#0118
the "mute" config setting basically sets the volume to a very low level where it still can be heard minimally - and that "still can be heard" is very essential for the way we presented the DEX app to apple.

[06-Dec-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i understand apple can have some strict rules

[06-Dec-19 05:24 PM] ca333#0118
our plan B would be a VOIP integration - basically a OTC feature so that DEX clients can have VOIP calls with each other based on pubkey. But this would be an overkill at this stage since the sound solution seems to work well so far...

[06-Dec-19 05:25 PM] ca333#0118
(VOIP apps are another classification that allows execution of background process on iOS)

[06-Dec-19 05:25 PM] ca333#0118
yea - Apple has some strict rules. The reason is that otherwise apps could drain the battery and let it look like poor apple device/tech...

[06-Dec-19 05:25 PM] Oszy#5734
it's pretty loud on "mute" on my phone

[06-Dec-19 05:26 PM] ca333#0118
you can turn down phone audio level too @Oszy

[06-Dec-19 05:26 PM] Oszy#5734
yes but that turns down everything else i'd like to hear

[06-Dec-19 05:26 PM] Oszy#5734
not very convenient

[06-Dec-19 05:37 PM] Flint#6435
I can‚Äôt remove the sound of ringing coins in the settings after the update, I remove the sound in the settings but the coins still ring constantly without stopping
