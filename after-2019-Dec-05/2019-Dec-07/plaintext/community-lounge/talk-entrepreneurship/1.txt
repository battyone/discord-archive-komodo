I am interested (but not keen yet) in testing small application implementations with the community in a micro loan setting over the next 6-12 months starting February 2020.  It is related to the collateralized lending system discussed in the #ask-jl777

The idea is to pilot some micro loan examples in units of 10KMD for *random internet jobs* like writing a blog or doing a graphic etc.

Plz contribute to conversation here or DM me your interest in the project if you prefer.  Cheers!

I already do something similar for a blog at HybridDEX.com 
Currently this is done using shapeshift to send an advance for some work.

Using the new tech, it would allow me to not exchange my KMD (eg I can hodl), and extract the value of KMD into EURK/USDK etc.

Replacing shapeshift as I currently use it, the payee (person receiving the advance/micro loan), can use atomicDEX to convert the EURK/USDK to a stablecoin supported by their local money changer.

Simple example.  Thanks for reading
