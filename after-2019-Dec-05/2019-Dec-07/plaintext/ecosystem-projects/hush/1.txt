[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you want to compile the latest release, there it is

[06-Dec-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUGE amount of work went into it, thank you to everybody!

[06-Dec-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This release is recommended for use with the SDA in Google Play, but older releases will work

[06-Dec-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `Now SD is translated into 13 languages!`

[06-Dec-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `New language translations: Finnish (FI), Croatian (HR), Serbian (SR), Dutch (NL)`

[06-Dec-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> epic work, to all involved. Thank you.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> üî¥  First 3 people that send a screenshot of the the new SDA Google Play app to Twitter and post it here get 100 Hush. Make sure to avoid showing any zaddrs!! The "About" or "settings" screen should be safe

This bug to the $KMD mempool handling code of zaddrs was actually discovered by the $HUSH community, let the record show. Thanks to various Komodo devs for helping debug the situation and come up with a proper fix. The latest version of Hush already contains a fix for this...

[06-Dec-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe because it is in beta

[06-Dec-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are a brand new app, it took a few days to approve it. Also, it can be a caching bug

[06-Dec-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Dec-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then click on the same link, maybe on the same computer or another, you could be getting an answer from a different server that doesn't have that data yet

[06-Dec-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just something to keep in mind. Not sure which it is
