There is indeed a little tech run going on, but we don‚Äôt see a real competition because at the end of the day, we are all aiming for the same goal - this ultimate freedom which is based on #cryptography and #trustless systems.

I talked about the benefits of multi-chain architecture versus the still popular single-chain #platform model at #OKEx Cryptour event in Kyiv.

[telegram] <Craig> I wonder what's the thought process behind going with the euro
Euro stable coins are widely available but I believe traders prefer USD +99% of the time, why go against the grain? 
Regardless this is a nice feature for the ecosystem to have

[06-Dec-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Euro is just the first,  will be a lot easier to get a fiat gateway between euro and euro-kmd started than a usd to usd-kmd.
