[06-Dec-19 04:34 AM] besudo#9750
ETH to KMD

[06-Dec-19 04:34 AM] besudo#9750
on Android

[06-Dec-19 04:34 AM] gcharang#6833
leave the app in background
it should auto refund you in 3 to 4 hours

no funfs were sent for 92a153a7-294d-4ec4-94ca-4ea0290a51d0, it timed out with `TakerFeeValidateFailed`, so not even the dexfee was sent

Latest Agama wallet (Version 0.5.9-2-Tech-Preview-02 (0.5.9-2.164)) is stuck for me on block 1635295 (Native KMD mode). It shows balance and transactions correctly. I've deleted the blockchain data and resynced three times. So is something out-of-date? Don't know what else to check.

[06-Dec-19 03:38 PM] Oszy#5734
KMD daemon is not updated in that version yet

[06-Dec-19 03:38 PM] Oszy#5734
you can use #wallet-ocean-qt for the time being

[06-Dec-19 03:38 PM] Oszy#5734
@endymionjkb

[06-Dec-19 03:39 PM] endymionjkb#3854
Ok; thanks! Thought it was something like that. What about the 12/20 upgrade? Does that affect the wallets in native mode? No emergency; I can just wait for Agama to be updated, assuming it will be?

[06-Dec-19 03:42 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[06-Dec-19 03:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Ocean QT already has Obsidian Dragon KMD hardfork compatability

[06-Dec-19 03:43 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
We expect to have Agama updated before 12/20.

[06-Dec-19 04:23 PM] zafar177#6208
I've had the same problem as @endymionjkb I was told by @oink to just download the bootstrap which is the wrong information because versus agama 0.5.9.2 has not been updated.

[06-Dec-19 04:35 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Let me put it this way: after installing the bootstrap, my Agama synced and showed all up-to-date information. The bootstrapping was actually suggested in this channel.

[06-Dec-19 04:43 PM] zafar177#6208
Fair enough. Impending forks always brings the worst out of the current software.ü§™

[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Very true... I'm also anxiously waiting on all new functions...

[06-Dec-19 09:59 PM] dael4#1861
just dloaded and ran 0.5.0 and it does not run? iS THERE A SYS REQ. for memory?

[06-Dec-19 10:06 PM] Oszy#5734

[06-Dec-19 11:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Have you already downloaded zcash params?

[06-Dec-19 11:28 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
With this hardfork what do we have to do in regards to ac nodes on a server? Running a few chain params atm

[06-Dec-19 11:28 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
How does one update üòÖ

[06-Dec-19 11:28 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Ubuntu

[06-Dec-19 11:28 PM] Oszy#5734
it wouldn't start loading it if it wasn't downloaded

[06-Dec-19 11:29 PM] Oszy#5734
@Crabby Paddy  update daemon then restart chains

[06-Dec-19 11:29 PM] Oszy#5734
stop chains, clone latest repo, replace komodod, start chains again

[06-Dec-19 11:31 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I low how to stop chains, how do we clone and replace? üòÇ complete Linux noob sorry. 

Also with the changes coming to pos, will pos64staker still continue to work?

[06-Dec-19 11:32 PM] Oszy#5734
same way you first did üòõ clone from github, follow readme üòÑ

[06-Dec-19 11:32 PM] Oszy#5734
it will work but you'll only have to use it to genereate addresses and split funds

[06-Dec-19 11:32 PM] Oszy#5734
later, not even that.

[06-Dec-19 11:33 PM] Oszy#5734
```
git clone https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
#This can take some time.```

[06-Dec-19 11:33 PM] Oszy#5734
new `komodod` will be in komodo/src

[06-Dec-19 11:34 PM] Oszy#5734
start the chains with the new daemon
