hi. what about supernet? how it transformed last 2years?

Looks like Coinpaprika's new mobile wallet supports `1989 coins and tokens` but not KMD... Maybe we can reach out to add it, or at least get some Twitter pushes

Only the Ledger vs Trezor support?

[06-Dec-19 11:05 AM] SHossain#0007
the first link supports both Ledger and Trezor. the second link only supports Ledger

[06-Dec-19 11:14 AM] farl#9964
Ok, that's it?

[06-Dec-19 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The first one is a copy of the second one üòõ

for the ledger claim that is

[06-Dec-19 11:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is also https://dexstats.info/ledger/ now. This one is using the same code but pointing to a different block explorer, so a good alternative just in case the block explorer is down.

looks like pbca26's `hw-kmd-reward-claim` was forked from atomiclabs's `ledger-kmd-reward-claim` , but with 30-ish commits ahead to add support for trezor <https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-reward-claim/commits/master>

Hmmm, missing the part where it claims AtomicDEX `runs a full P2P node in the user‚Äôs web browser`.

[06-Dec-19 03:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Does that need a correction, or am I misunderstanding ‚òùÔ∏è

[06-Dec-19 03:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, because p2p...

[06-Dec-19 03:24 PM] CrisF#3405
I was confused by `P2P Full Node` in title.  In story it says `full peer-to-peer (P2P) node`.

[06-Dec-19 03:25 PM] CrisF#3405

Good job getting cointelegraph to write an article about kmd, the marketing pill must be kicking in. I remember a time not so long ago that kmd was continually ignored by crypto news. üçª

[06-Dec-19 04:55 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
is arrr listed on bilaxy just now ?

[06-Dec-19 05:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs not open yet but yes arrr will be on bilaxy

[06-Dec-19 05:51 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
@polycryptoblog any idea when ?

[06-Dec-19 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
best place to ask that would be in Pirate discord

[06-Dec-19 06:44 PM] Oszy#5734
we don't know yet @Offshore Crypto

[06-Dec-19 06:48 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
do lite wallet users need to do anything for the update?

[06-Dec-19 06:49 PM] Oszy#5734
no

[06-Dec-19 07:39 PM] zafar177#6208
Will Komodo try to get official adoption by Trezor?

Anyone know the link to this browser dex? @SHossain

Hey beautiful peeps. Jeff from PIVX here again! doing my part

[06-Dec-19 07:59 PM] phm87#7395
Do you have ideas how to industrialize this process ? As malware lists and bad IP lists

[06-Dec-19 07:59 PM] Jeffrey#2716
I'm going to blatantly tell you this. Discord doesn't care.

[06-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Jeffrey#2716
My communication with them falls upon deaf ears

[06-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Jeffrey#2716
They even checked an imposters conversation with me, Using my username and still didn't ban him

[06-Dec-19 08:00 PM] phm87#7395
I was thinking about a unique channel to tag spammers and a bot that use this information but also other sources of infos (other discords or else)

[06-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Jeffrey#2716
Yes

[06-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Jeffrey#2716
There is a bot we use

[06-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Jeffrey#2716
Check in the PIVX masternode channel if you in our Discord. Just banned him there.

[06-Dec-19 08:01 PM] phm87#7395
does it retrieve data from several discords ? I mean if I receive spam from one discord account, there is a huge chance that you want to ban it

[06-Dec-19 08:01 PM] phm87#7395
thank you for the info I'll check

[06-Dec-19 08:02 PM] Jeffrey#2716
Honestly i'm not the one that installed it or manages it but that is a good question, I do see it ban users automatically as well

[06-Dec-19 08:03 PM] phm87#7395
I just received a DM giveaway spam in DM coming from another discord while we were discussing ... lol

[06-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Jeffrey#2716
Tell me about it, I got about 9 dms in a few seconds just yesterday

[06-Dec-19 11:16 PM] farl#9964
@Jeffrey Send me the long ID and I will ban them. Activate Developer settings to copy the long ID.

[06-Dec-19 11:29 PM] phm87#7395
I banned him 3 hours ago, he shared these infos few messages above @farl

[06-Dec-19 11:32 PM] phm87#7395
But I'd like to automate this process and use infos from other known discord servers (Hush, KMD, zpool, ...)

[06-Dec-19 11:37 PM] phm87#7395
spammers are experts in automation but they also use some humans to perform some actions, then a DM spammer may be able to suceed in the KMD discord entry test (in #introductions ). A human may also be able to fail the test. I'll first have a look at the tool that Jeffrey suggested
