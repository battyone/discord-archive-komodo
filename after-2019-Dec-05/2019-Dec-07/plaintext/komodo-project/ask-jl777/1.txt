So for example, I have 1 BTC, I need ‚Ç¨ so I collateralize it for 7500 USDK, send them to kraken, change them to ‚Ç¨, do what I need and then I return 7500 USDK back I get 1 BTC? without paying any fee?

[06-Dec-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we are planning a KMD backed EUR stablecoin. so you would purchase 1BTC of KMD and deposit it, that allows to issue up to 80% worth of EURK, let us approx to 5000 EURK. these EURK are freely tradeable. you can use it on atomicDEX and once we get on a fiat exchange, can then deposit the EURK and then withdraw the EUR via SEPA.

[06-Dec-19 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
at anytime, you can payoff the 5000 EURK you issued and recover the KMD that was locked

[06-Dec-19 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be only be fees (tx, gateway, etc) but no interest rate you need to pay back

[06-Dec-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody is lending you the EURK, you are actually creating them yourself

[06-Dec-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a it different than all the other stablecoins as far as i know

even without the fiat integration, using atomicdex to trade EURK to a stablecoin that is available in your jurisdiction/fiat-on-ramp opens up whatever is around.   just need the stablecoin/stablecoin liquidity also.

[06-Dec-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is demand for it, marketmakers will arise that will create the liquidity, but with some bid/ask spread

yeah i had someone enquire about stablecoin marketmaking on this discord a few months ago.   they'll definitely pop up for stable 0.25 - 1.5% spreads.   
awesome news!

[06-Dec-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
of course to do a SEPA transfer you will need to KYC, but that is up to each user and the exchange. the cc pegs will operate fully decentralized, no specific manager of the stablecoin. each person controls their own share of the overall stablecoin supply

[06-Dec-19 06:24 AM] Mylo#8306
cool thanks for pointers in the description of it over the last few days üôè

[06-Dec-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the DTO allows each node to validate the price and that is really what allows it to be decentralized as each node will know the price of KMD/EUR

Wow great thanks for thinking about ‚Ç¨ too

[06-Dec-19 06:54 AM] criptobear#6402
So maybe there will be some lending solution like makerdao and others are doing, so I collateralize and lend the ‚Ç¨ sum to get some interest?

[06-Dec-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the pegs CC implements a blockchain enforced decentralized stablecoin issuing. there will be ways for people to "mine" accounts in default and make 5%. to do this you will need to have EURK already, so it wouldnt be interest but rather liquidation fees that you can earn. personally i am not so fond of charging interests, the big problem is where do the funds for the interest come from. if we are dealing with a pegged value, we cant just issue more coins. which means people will need to pay it

[06-Dec-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, there are plenty of such systems out there, EURK probably will be the only interest free loan system. this way, if you really need some EUR and dont want to sell any KMD, you can lock the KMD and borrow against it. as soon as you repay it, your KMD is released

[06-Dec-19 07:11 AM] Lennart#9331
does it have any effect when the locked-in KMD fluctuate in fiat-value?

[06-Dec-19 07:11 AM] Lennart#9331
could someone else release my KMD ?

If your collateralization  falls below the threshold

[06-Dec-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have less than 10% equity left, it is allowed for anybody to liquidate it and gain a 5%+ arbitrage profit

[06-Dec-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but you can add EURK or KMD to your address to avoid this

[06-Dec-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
at scale, this effect creates demand for KMD as the price of KMD falls

[06-Dec-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
and of course having KMD locked, removes it from circulation for the time being

[06-Dec-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD would allow people to either get 5% rewards, or an interest free loan against collateral for a EURK coin (that hopefully can be used for SEPA transfers when going through a gateway). it has been pointed out that losing the 5% rewards is an opportunity cost, but at worst it is a 5% and for a short term loan it is not a major issue

[06-Dec-19 08:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The biggest differentiator is when it comes to txfees,  other stablecoins require parent chain currency to move around the stablecoin.

@jl777c as kraken being biggest euro exchange wouldn't it be natural choise for EURK exchange?

[06-Dec-19 01:05 PM] Mark81#4505
Am i understanding correctly that one that hold EURK coins can redeem them back for kmd from smartcontract? This is quite new consept but very intresting. Who will receive newly isuued EURK coins after original peg creation if kmd price rises later on?

[06-Dec-19 01:07 PM] Markus#5464
It might be a natural choice but considering they have not listed KMD yet i would not get too big hopes on that to happen

[06-Dec-19 01:11 PM] Mark81#4505
How about ECB? Are they intrested? They would might want their currency to be pegged to something.

[06-Dec-19 02:03 PM] artik123#2884
As far as I know, in the real world you can always liquidate a loan that was taken against hard money (for example a savings account).

Many people will take loans because they think that the collateral will raise in value and they meanwhile wish to spend the loan in the real world...

What happens, for example, if the collateral has doubled or tripled in value but the borrower doesn't have anymore usdk to replay the loan? He is "stuck". I think that it's a useful use case to have a mechanism to "save" him. For example, a third party in a trustless manner could repay the loan in usdk just to get back the equivalent kmd plus a nice fee and the borrower could get the difference.

[06-Dec-19 02:32 PM] bitcoinsfacil - pedro [MYCE]#0336
@jl777c I would check BitShares that has been dealing with the dynamics of running a stable coin on-chain for almost 4 years already. Nothing against Komodo but a lot of data could be taken in from their experience.

[06-Dec-19 03:39 PM] mobipoi#5774
A video explaining the way the stable backed platform works would be nice

[06-Dec-19 03:39 PM] mobipoi#5774
Not sure how it works I turn my kmd in usdk but why?

[06-Dec-19 03:40 PM] mobipoi#5774
As if the value of kmd drops that my usdk will have more value

[06-Dec-19 03:40 PM] mobipoi#5774
Who is taking the hit

[06-Dec-19 03:41 PM] mobipoi#5774
A clear video explaining this will be helpful

[06-Dec-19 04:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@mobipoi   Why turn kmd to usdk : 1) hedging 2) fiat access without liquidating your kmd 3)  further pegging ( for derivatives ) .    When the value of KMD drops,  you will have to deposit more KMD and/or pay back usdk or else risk account being liquidated.  When accounts get liquidated 5% goes into a reserve for amelioration of debts and the liquidator makes 5%.   Debt holder loses 10% . In @artik123   Situation where price of collateral goes up the user either needs to acquire usdk from other users to redeem their collateral  or extract more usdk from account to cause liquidation to ‚Äúunstick‚Äù collateral and consequently sell the stablecoin on the open market for kmd

[06-Dec-19 04:46 PM] artik123#2884
@polycryptoblog I know that this is what he can do, but I'm talking about the use case where he doesn't have the resources to to buy usdk to repay it. 
Think about the real world. You took a loan which was based on a (collateral) saving account (and the collateral is is all the money you have!), now you have spent the loan and you don't have money to repay it. You're stuck even if the collateral goes 10x.

[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if the value goes up, you can issue more stablecoins

[06-Dec-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
of course if you borrowed 80% to begin with, there isnt much equity left to gain in value

[06-Dec-19 04:54 PM] artik123#2884
You had 100 kmd as collateral for 50 usdk (x). And the 100 kmd is all you had.
Now lets say collateral kmd goes up 10x. How can I repay it? Even it you choose to issue more usdk (y) because the kmd price appreciate you still need to repay  x+y usdk to liquidate the loan

[06-Dec-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
true, if you go all in, you could get stuck

[06-Dec-19 04:56 PM] artik123#2884
Unlike the real world....

[06-Dec-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
how is it different

[06-Dec-19 04:56 PM] gcharang#6833
@artik123 your loan is 50 usdk
regardless of the price movements of KMD, (within limits)
you always need to repay 50 usdk

in your example if KMD value goes 10x up,
you can withdraw even more usdk

[06-Dec-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
you are still able to extract value out of it, in the form of stablecoins, just not in KMD

[06-Dec-19 04:58 PM] artik123#2884
In the real world you can liquidate the collateral even if it gain money. The and the saving account  could split between you and the company that made the loan. Here with usdk you're stuck

[06-Dec-19 05:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
In the real world you pay interest on loans and the amount of the loan is fixed. Assuming that someone else out there also had a usdk debt to pay, the additional usdk generated will be bought up

[06-Dec-19 05:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The system is more like a line of credit than a loan

[06-Dec-19 05:07 PM] artik123#2884
If I get you right, that's exactly what I'm talking about here.... a third party that will pay it. (Regarding the interest it's irrelevant for this discussion)

[06-Dec-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i believe the implementation will allow a third party to pay off the pending debt for a redeem (withdraw) of unrelated stablecoins. there is no penalty to the account holder in this case

[06-Dec-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the selection of non-defaulting account will be in reverse order, so the least leveraged would be selected first and this seems like a good way to unwind people that are stuck due to an all in situation

[06-Dec-19 05:14 PM] artik123#2884
I think that the solution could also be done without third party, but maybe programically more complex

[06-Dec-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that the account has an unpaid debt and external funds are needed to clear it and you are saying this user went all in and has no other funds. i cant see how to unwind this without a third party

[06-Dec-19 05:18 PM] artik123#2884
The contract sells his kmd on the open market for usdk, repay the debt in usdk and give him back the rest

[06-Dec-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is more than 50% equity, it seems this is possible

[06-Dec-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is less than 50% equity, it seems not

[06-Dec-19 05:21 PM] artik123#2884
Yes. I was initially talking about possible big apprciation if the underlying collateral. 2x, 3x etc

[06-Dec-19 05:22 PM] artik123#2884
So the 50% equity shouldn't be a problem

[06-Dec-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case, we should be able to make a "close account" rpc call to free up the equity (KMD)

[06-Dec-19 05:25 PM] artik123#2884
Yep

[06-Dec-19 05:26 PM] jspook16#3059
Would it be optional to have the account closed?

[06-Dec-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you invoke the close account, it wouldnt be closed

[06-Dec-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a chance your account is randomly chosen to support a withdraw

[06-Dec-19 07:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Is there plans to do other major currencies like USD/AUD/GBP etc?

[06-Dec-19 09:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That is the hope .  Euro should be a good test run though for fiat gateway acceptance.  I think how it is structured as an interest-free mechanism also greatly sets it a part from other platforms which are loan-like in nature. This may help in acceptance in other more stringent jurisdictions.

[06-Dec-19 09:52 PM] Mylo#8306
Great to see ppl ask about this collateralized lending system.  It is a phenomenal (re)development.  Plz read #talk-entrepreneurship

[06-Dec-19 10:33 PM] artik123#2884
I would like to add a couple more words and sum up my thoughts.

There is a saying that the bank will give you an umbrella on a sunny day, but when the first drop of rain starts they will take it back. Some people get in trouble sometimes, and it's part if life.
Back to our issue. It doesn't always mean that when someone issued a loan he doesn't have the resources to repay it. It can also mean that at the time he wants to liquidate it he doesn't have them, and there is a big difference.

Regardless of what we spoke, I think that the "close account" option is in many cases a very convenient way to redeem a  loan. Even if he does have assets to redeem the loan, he wouldn't have to sell them in order to buy usdk to support the withdrawal (and then possibly to sell the kmd that they got to buy back the assets). It's just a hustle free option.

Without a "closing account" option, it could possibly lead to a systemic problem where, over time, more and more loans would never be redeemed and an ever-increasing amount of usdk will be floating around. I'm not sure what the consequences of it will be...

[06-Dec-19 10:38 PM] Mylo#8306
There seems to be a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù option to lock up other coins besides KMD to generate USDK, which can be used to close account of a previous loan.

[06-Dec-19 10:41 PM] Mylo#8306
Eg
10000KMD for initial loan of 5500USDK
You only have 5200 USDK to pay back, but have 4000 DGB.
Lock up the DGB, extract the value in USDK of say 300USDK.
Pay back the 5500 initial loan, unlock KMD.

Is this a suitable scenario for the close account with other assets?

[06-Dec-19 10:44 PM] artik123#2884
What happens when at the time you wish to liquidate the kmd your DGB has already depreciated to zero?

[06-Dec-19 10:54 PM] Mylo#8306
What if....
This is the risk of putting up collateral.  It is secured credit, not a credit card.
CDPs are used for loans to get liquidity for other opportunities with the hope of making the effort worthwhile.

If you have a mortgage to 90% of the value of your house, and the market goes down by 20%, the lending policy of your mortgagors (lenders) may be to foreclose on your loan.  It is the way secured credit works for lower interest.

In this case it is 0% loan.

In the event of DGB falling in value, it is unfortunate market conditions and whatever the initial 5500USDK loan was used for hopefully was used for good opportunities to outweigh the liquidation of the smaller asset.  If the market is screwed, what else is there to do?  Ask for a bailout?

[06-Dec-19 10:57 PM] Mylo#8306
I re read your question.  It is a market condition scenario.  The idea is to get a loan and pay it back quickly imo.  It is not designed as a multi year investment.....unless there is a huge bull market.

[06-Dec-19 11:01 PM] artik123#2884
It seems that your response is irrelevant to what I wrote... I'm not sure how to respond.

The loan should be taken to any period... Long or short. What are you going to tell to a person who took a loan and got stuck? "Sorry, It was meant for short periods" :)

[06-Dec-19 11:18 PM] crumb#2550
volatility is volatility. no ways around that. you cannot have "risk free" loans, there are always risks involved. 

of course it makes sense to have as many options available when having loan crypto products. to cover as many scenarios as possible

but risk **always** exists

[06-Dec-19 11:19 PM] artik123#2884
@Mylo What you're actually suggesting that if he spent his usdk or just made failed investments with them, he should also get screwed with his kmd redeem. Even if they appreciated in value. It's nonsense.

[06-Dec-19 11:20 PM] artik123#2884
@crumb we are talking about the up side not the down side

[06-Dec-19 11:23 PM] crumb#2550
still unexpected things can happen. like i said earlier, it is good to plan (programmatic) ways into the loan solution, to close the loan and keep some of the original collateral that had huge upswing in price

@Mylo It seems that people here are not user oriented. Just the same as the discussion we had about the AtomicDex GUI a couple of weeks ago. But you will understand it very well when someone designs a GUI with lazy registration and low activation energy (no long EULA scrolling and no seed phrase to set at the registration... he could skip it if he wants and only get a friendly reminder after the user had experienced the app and feel comfortable) and take the market.

[06-Dec-19 11:51 PM] phm87#7395
@artik123 the mechanism of how it works is similar to DAI. And about having a loan in fiat baked on cryptos, I know few companies that make that. It have some risks (in case of market dump). Usually, ppl make that to buy real estate and pay way less taxes.

[06-Dec-19 11:56 PM] phm87#7395
``What you're actually suggesting that if he spent his usdk or just made failed investments with them, he should also get screwed with his kmd redeem. Even if they appreciated in value. It's nonsense.``
in real life, if you make a loan with some collateral (real estate, company shares, cryptos, ...) for anything and you burn/loose the money, whatever any collateral gained value, bank will sell everything at a stupid price to get their money. In the case of KEUR, some math can't be worth than bank rules for selling your stuff. I know ppl who were seized for thousands of ‚Ç¨ for small unpaid bills of few hundreds because it is sold at very low price (but unpaid bills is a little bit different)
