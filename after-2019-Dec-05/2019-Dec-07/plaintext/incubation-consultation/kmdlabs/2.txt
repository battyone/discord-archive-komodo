pip 19.3.1 from /home/daemonfox/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip (python 2.7)

[06-Dec-19 05:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
im not sure how to clean this up...

[06-Dec-19 05:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
but the error seems to be PATH related cuz pip can be installed incorrectly

[06-Dec-19 06:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i  installed  python 3.8

[06-Dec-19 06:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[06-Dec-19 06:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[06-Dec-19 06:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i just  read  that  last  week

[06-Dec-19 06:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think you  just  need to install 3.8  a  certain  way

[06-Dec-19 06:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
but  there  was  also an uninstall  reinstall  instruction  i  followed

[06-Dec-19 06:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
it  fixed  my  path problem

[06-Dec-19 06:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i  am not sure which  thing I did actually  fixed  it

[06-Dec-19 06:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
dont forget  apt-get update

[06-Dec-19 06:11 AM] daemonfox#6136

[06-Dec-19 06:15 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i didnt  feel like fixing  the old  versions  or installation  ---  I said fek it

[06-Dec-19 06:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

[06-Dec-19 06:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and  that

[06-Dec-19 06:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
pip3

[06-Dec-19 06:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
pip3 install

[06-Dec-19 06:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Now you have a functional Python 3.8 setup on your Ubuntu 18.04 machine. If you want to install something system-wide, make sure to use pip3.

[06-Dec-19 06:18 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
pip3 install base58

[06-Dec-19 06:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
sudo make altinstall

[06-Dec-19 06:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
this is the line

[06-Dec-19 06:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
that makes the difference

[06-Dec-19 06:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
make altinstall is used to prevent replacing the default python binary file /usr/bin/python.

[06-Dec-19 06:19 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[06-Dec-19 06:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
