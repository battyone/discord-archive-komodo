[06-Dec-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
im literally following the steps listed here... so any outsider using 16.04 server LTS is going to have the same issues

[06-Dec-19 02:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
pip install secrets

[06-Dec-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[06-Dec-19 02:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
do i need to change something for bash PATH to use a specific py?

[06-Dec-19 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ sudo update-alternatives --config python

[06-Dec-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

when I do Ubuntu, I do the newest LTS that's behind the newest release (i.e., 18.04.3 LTS < 19.10)

[06-Dec-19 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just uise bash`
because you haven't written one yet? 😛

[06-Dec-19 03:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
