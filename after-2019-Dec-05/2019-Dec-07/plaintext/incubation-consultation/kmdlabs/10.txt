not really an issue, we'll never have an ac_notarypay ac_perc chain

[06-Dec-19 11:13 PM] Alright#0419
can't think of any reason we'd ever have that

[06-Dec-19 11:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
what kind of silly cuk answer is that?

[06-Dec-19 11:16 PM] hastrup#8742
how do i get a pubkey?

[06-Dec-19 11:17 PM] Oszy#5734
`./komodo-cli validateaddress "address"`

[06-Dec-19 11:18 PM] hastrup#8742
is it from the pos64staker folder?

[06-Dec-19 11:18 PM] Oszy#5734
what? why do you need a pubkey anyway?

[06-Dec-19 11:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Alright 
<https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commit/435d7de48ac253b96567d2f6b9018f642ac0a727>
is in the pos64/src, so that's obviously *not* the fix

[06-Dec-19 11:21 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[06-Dec-19 11:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[06-Dec-19 11:22 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
seems not, because I went to manually apply it and it's all already there

[06-Dec-19 11:23 PM] Alright#0419
yea he didn't properly fix it

[06-Dec-19 11:26 PM] Oszy#5734
