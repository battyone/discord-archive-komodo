[06-Dec-19 09:38 PM] Alright#0419
yep definitely does not work @blackjok3r

[06-Dec-19 09:38 PM] Alright#0419
unstuck btw

[06-Dec-19 09:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol how you do that?

[06-Dec-19 09:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
using you founders key to force a block?

[06-Dec-19 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
no just restarted my staker node with `-minrelaytxfee=99999` then staked a block

[06-Dec-19 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
the problem is that you have a notarization in mempool and the next block is paying founder's reward

[06-Dec-19 09:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
so needs more fee to move?

[06-Dec-19 09:40 PM] Alright#0419
no that makes my node not add any txes to the block

[06-Dec-19 09:40 PM] Alright#0419
minrelaytxfee

[06-Dec-19 09:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh

[06-Dec-19 09:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
got it

[06-Dec-19 09:40 PM] Alright#0419
that is saying, don't mine any txes unless they pay 99999 coins in fees

[06-Dec-19 09:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok its confirmed doing the TUI again

[06-Dec-19 09:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
```make a selection:2

Are you happy with these?(y/n): y
Please wait....
```

[06-Dec-19 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
use the `sendmany.py` script from master branch, I need to fix that

[06-Dec-19 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
can't determine why it happens, the code is spaghetti

[06-Dec-19 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
it's stuck in a while loop that will never end because of joker's first attempt at writing python code

[06-Dec-19 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```diff

- coins
+ satoshis```

[06-Dec-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
no

[06-Dec-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
thought that too

[06-Dec-19 09:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok reconsolidating

[06-Dec-19 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`src/main.h:87:static const unsigned int DEFAULT_MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 100;`
if it were coins, you'd never mine anything

[06-Dec-19 09:44 PM] hastrup#8742
im getting stuck. cant find komodod and komodo-cli. the folders i have is kmdlabs and .zcash-params

[06-Dec-19 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_might actually know a thing or 2 about mining, just maybe_

[06-Dec-19 09:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
cd kmdlabs

[06-Dec-19 09:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
run the build scripts

[06-Dec-19 09:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
komodod and cli will be in src dir

[06-Dec-19 09:46 PM] hastrup#8742
i have run this

[06-Dec-19 09:46 PM] hastrup#8742
git clone https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
