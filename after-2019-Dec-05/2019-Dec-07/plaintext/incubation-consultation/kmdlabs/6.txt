I have been goign though the code for this poroject and most of it is so old, I knew nothing... can fix but if it works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

the 1st element in an array is 0 (and has a feken value ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

[06-Dec-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
at least in VB they shifted the elements and use "0" as the count and element 1 is array[1]

[06-Dec-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[06-Dec-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the more code you write the more bugs there will be

[06-Dec-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[06-Dec-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
could have made it it's own repo, but it took me 10 minutes instead of 2 hours

[06-Dec-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, entire project here seems to be like that... Never any time.. .

[06-Dec-19 03:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[06-Dec-19 03:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[06-Dec-19 03:42 PM] Alright#0419

[06-Dec-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
daemon is fine, mostly fixing non consensus shit that has annoyed me... Liek the miner minng when the chain is syncing etc

[06-Dec-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems like most issues are with the python scripts

[06-Dec-19 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
I'll strip it down today

[06-Dec-19 03:58 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
probably dont need to strip it down - just use old code that worked fine for blocknotify and basic operations --not sure what new code implements anyway

[06-Dec-19 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
there is no new code in pos64staker other than the entercomp code

[06-Dec-19 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
in fact, pos64staker will be deprecated for everything besides generating addresses and splitting to them

[06-Dec-19 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
which will in itself be deprecated soon enough

[06-Dec-19 04:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
AHHHHHHHH i may have FINALLY fixed it
