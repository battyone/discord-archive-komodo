@daemonfox ?

[06-Dec-19 06:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
--branch pos64

[06-Dec-19 06:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
from earlier notes

[06-Dec-19 06:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
sorry my bad ont hat first one

[06-Dec-19 06:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
notes? who's got time to read those? 😛

[06-Dec-19 06:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
once I changed it to that branch it synced that chain properly

[06-Dec-19 06:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
so wouldnt be suprised since thats the branch with the new algo

[06-Dec-19 06:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
and likely why getblocktemplate failed on master without that

[06-Dec-19 06:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the sync bits haven't been 100% right 100% of the time in a long long time (better now than was, but still not always 100%)

[06-Dec-19 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```                    if (result.error) {
                        emitErrorLog('getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance ' + result.instance.index + ' with error ' + JSON.stringify(result.error));
                        callback(result.error);

🤣

[06-Dec-19 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
had to put that in the pool as a "work around"

[06-Dec-19 06:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
lmao 4 error handles?

[06-Dec-19 06:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, there are 4 reasons (that I've come across) it comes back dinked

[06-Dec-19 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2 & 4 are uber rare, but they do happen

[06-Dec-19 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so rather that halt/crash the pool, it just retries

[06-Dec-19 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pos64 branch has a diffrent HF timestamp to master so they are not compatible

and no stakes, ever

[06-Dec-19 08:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
in the TUI what does this mean??? Enter percentage of variance:

[06-Dec-19 08:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
its the expectation of a squared deviaion of a random variable from the mean.

also STAKE MORE my utxo split is waiting

_can't stake period, it's broken_

[06-Dec-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 joker fixed that yesterday

[06-Dec-19 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then he should have pushed it yesterday 🤷🏽‍♂️

[06-Dec-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
it's because you have notarization in mempool and next block is ac_perc block

[06-Dec-19 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
ac_notarypay + ac_perc in same block no bueno

[06-Dec-19 09:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
what is an ac_perc block?

[06-Dec-19 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
founder's fee

[06-Dec-19 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
genie are you sure you're on latest?

[06-Dec-19 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that he didn't push a fix yesterday doesn't help me today

[06-Dec-19 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
if it is, not properly fixed

[06-Dec-19 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
he did?

[06-Dec-19 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
said he did at least

[06-Dec-19 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`genie are you sure you're on latest?`

[06-Dec-19 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
you're saying this doesn't fix it?

[06-Dec-19 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm saying that's on a different branch (one that coincidentally wouldn't sync this chain)

[06-Dec-19 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
which chain?

[06-Dec-19 09:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
master DOES NOT SYNC CG is correct

[06-Dec-19 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
-ac_name=CFEKPOS1

[06-Dec-19 09:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
we all had to swap to pos64 branch for CFEKPOS1

[06-Dec-19 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
it won't work on any other branch

[06-Dec-19 09:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
nope

[06-Dec-19 09:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
not that I saw... last night mine wouldnt sync cuz master... swap this AM and its fully in sync with NN

[06-Dec-19 09:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
just sent coins from NN to TUIstaker

[06-Dec-19 09:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
they there... just awaiting the split to finish

[06-Dec-19 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
stuck at Please wait....?

[06-Dec-19 09:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
stuck at block 632 i think?

[06-Dec-19 09:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
on master

[06-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
I mean when you told TUIstaker to split your coins

[06-Dec-19 09:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
right now its just waiting on a PoW block it sounds like

[06-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
is it stuck

[06-Dec-19 09:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh yes

[06-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
yea it's broken

consolidate coins then do it again

[06-Dec-19 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
something to do with joker's while loop in that func

[06-Dec-19 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`right now its just waiting on a PoW block it sounds like`
diff is too high for PoW, it's still in PoS mode

[06-Dec-19 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
it's waiting for a while loop to end that will never end @daemonfox

[06-Dec-19 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
stop it, do `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 sendtoaddress $(komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 getnewaddress) $(komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 getbalance) "" "" true`

[06-Dec-19 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
then do it again after that tx confirms

[06-Dec-19 09:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok... TUI again or rerun that same command a second time?

[06-Dec-19 09:32 PM] Alright#0419
TUI split again

[06-Dec-19 09:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
gonna be a while until a block is found...

it is active in the background yes

[06-Dec-19 09:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
CG... is there a pool you using for CFEKPOS1?

[06-Dec-19 09:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill throw my z9 mini at it if I need to...

[06-Dec-19 09:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
cuz we wont be getting it through PoS since its ac_perc like Alright said... founders fee block...

[06-Dec-19 09:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
we need to PoW it

[06-Dec-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
has nothing to do with pow vs pos

[06-Dec-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
is the chain stalled right now?

[06-Dec-19 09:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
YES

[06-Dec-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
will fix, hold on

[06-Dec-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r that fix didn't work apparently

[06-Dec-19 09:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats what Genie posted... multiple PoS failures to mine 1790

[06-Dec-19 09:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
but noted diff of PoW is too high for CPU hash to find it anytime soon
