[06-Dec-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still dont understand why it needs that.. Millions of lines of code we didnt write lol.

[06-Dec-19 06:55 AM] Oszy#5734
new stakerlib uses it i think

[06-Dec-19 06:56 AM] Oszy#5734
```
from bitcoin.wallet import P2PKHBitcoinAddress
from bitcoin.core import x
from bitcoin.core import CoreMainParams```

[06-Dec-19 06:56 AM] Oszy#5734
for pubkey check and base58 check

[06-Dec-19 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont need it though....

[06-Dec-19 06:57 AM] Oszy#5734
yeah validateaddress does that

[06-Dec-19 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[06-Dec-19 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once you get a VM that works copy it man.

[06-Dec-19 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have like 10 here all copied from the same one

[06-Dec-19 07:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
should put in the readme IGNORE POP3 STATING YOU NEED TO UPDATE! ITS A TRAP!

[06-Dec-19 07:02 AM] Oszy#5734
why? never had a problem with latest pip

[06-Dec-19 07:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
pip site says dont do it unless you installed pip manually... if you apt or it came with your distro use that package manager

[06-Dec-19 07:03 AM] Oszy#5734
😕

[06-Dec-19 07:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 19.3.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.

[06-Dec-19 07:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
^^^

[06-Dec-19 07:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
pip site says dont do that unless you manually installed it

[06-Dec-19 07:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
thats what breaks the wrapper not using the correct python and pip

[06-Dec-19 07:04 AM] Oszy#5734
you on 16.04?

[06-Dec-19 07:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
and all the posted stackoverflow questions about it get closed pointing to one solution page talking about it

[06-Dec-19 07:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
yes

[06-Dec-19 07:05 AM] Oszy#5734
consider 18.04 that only has python3 pre-installed so you won't end up with 2.7 at all

[06-Dec-19 07:05 AM] Oszy#5734
i've been trough this 😄

[06-Dec-19 07:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
may try that... last time i couldnt get 18.04 to work for anything with this

[06-Dec-19 07:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
so past my bedtime...

[06-Dec-19 07:06 AM] Oszy#5734

[06-Dec-19 10:59 AM] hastrup#8742
taking a sas/sata conveter to an sata/usb converter did not work and a pci/usb converter you know them from mining. to an usb/sata converter also did not work.

[06-Dec-19 10:59 AM] hastrup#8742
is it possible to just run it on a sd card for this test?

[06-Dec-19 11:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if the card is large enough, yes

[06-Dec-19 11:02 AM] hastrup#8742
64 gb?

[06-Dec-19 11:03 AM] hastrup#8742
shxc 80-90 mb samsund clas 10

[06-Dec-19 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for a 1 week chain, that should be big enough with some to spare

[06-Dec-19 11:04 AM] hastrup#8742
ok thx

[06-Dec-19 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, if that drive is known good then you need to start looking at your BIOS settings

[06-Dec-19 11:07 AM] hastrup#8742
what bios setting should i look out for? they are both brand new so i doubt both of them are faulty

[06-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Oszy#5734
@hastrup have you configured the RAID controller?

[06-Dec-19 11:10 AM] hastrup#8742
no i have not but does that also need to be configured  if i only have one disk in?

[06-Dec-19 11:10 AM] Oszy#5734
proliant comes with a P420 controller, unless you set that up windows installer won't see your drives

[06-Dec-19 11:10 AM] Oszy#5734
https://techzone.ergon.ch/HP-DL360-G8-RAID

[06-Dec-19 11:10 AM] Oszy#5734
check this

[06-Dec-19 11:10 AM] Oszy#5734
you need to have a logical drive in your controller

[06-Dec-19 11:10 AM] Oszy#5734
otherwise it's like you don't have any drives
