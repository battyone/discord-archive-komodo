keep in mind that i expect things can crash after an hour, i need to add protection against that, so if it crashes after an hour, then just restart for now. i will work on that after i increase the 64 tags total limit.

please ask questions, the DEX_broadcast and DEX_list have quite a few parameters","","üëç (3)"
