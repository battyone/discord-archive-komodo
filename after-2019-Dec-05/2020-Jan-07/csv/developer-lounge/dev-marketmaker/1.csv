However we might still have to increase the locktime especially when 2 notarized coins are swapped. E.g. if on DEX/KMD swap DEX payment (4h locktime) takes 80 minutes for notarization and then KMD payment (2h locktime) takes 80 minutes for notarization the KMD payment will be refundable right away. So it should be 40/20 hours (same as BTC) or bit lower as we have a request to decrease BTC payments locktime.","",""
