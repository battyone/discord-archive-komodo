There is a constant issue of coins by miners and stakeholders with lack of demand from large investors, as there is currently no REAL use of the coin, so at least until the launch of DEFI on the platform and the KMD credit system with freezing, we will not see any growth and demand and the price will remain wallow close to the bottom!","","ðŸ‘† (1)"

Celsius Network is trying to add staking/reward coins and it supports a lot of stable coins too...  it would be a small step, but one in the right direction and one that shouldnt be too hard to make.","",""
