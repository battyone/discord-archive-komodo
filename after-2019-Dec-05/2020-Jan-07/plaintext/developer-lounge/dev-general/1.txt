@Oszy are you talking about KMD price app or atomicdex exchanges num?

[06-Jan-20 04:01 AM] kolo#1111
Seems you re the only user of both except me and @Decker :lol:

[06-Jan-20 04:08 AM] kolo#1111
I now fixed AtomicDEX app to show actual number again, but beware it's grabbing stats from dexstats.info (totalSwaps) and I'm not sure if it still works, seems number is too old.

it's updating again and I imported all the swaps cipi had

i have an issue regarding locktime on multisig addresses on an assetchain. I'm using VRSC Agama and it creates a tx which i decoded on the left side of the screenshot. on the right side, it is the manually created one on the command line, witihout a locktime set (but with expirytime set, as i see now)

i checked the locktime of the left transaction and it is the current time, so after the creation of the tx, it has elapsed and it should be unlocked to be broadcasted. However, when trying to broadcast, it shows me a `code: 1, the transaction was rejected by network rules. non-final code -26` error. 
can anyone tell me why the Agama VRSC created tx is non-final?

i have successfully done multisig transactions on Agama VRSC before, so i'm not sure what is going wrong here

[06-Jan-20 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
how long ago was 8 blocks ago?

[06-Jan-20 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
locktime uses median time

[06-Jan-20 04:36 PM] jorian#4555
So this would be fixed if we don't use locktime at all

[06-Jan-20 04:37 PM] jorian#4555
we = i

[06-Jan-20 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
then it would be final. usually setting the locktime to current time has a chance of being rejected

[06-Jan-20 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
set it to 10 minutes ago

@jorian this has some background history related to why it exists: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/doc/bitcoin-release-notes/release-notes-0.11.2.md#bip113-mempool-only-locktime-enforcement-using-getmediantimepast

oh thanks

[06-Jan-20 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
since KMD has different block times, some of the values (such as 1 hr) are not correct from that BTC relnotes, but I found it educational to read. I have read all the code, but that doesn't quite tell the full story

[06-Jan-20 04:57 PM] jorian#4555
ok. well it doesn't really serve a purpose other than locking coins to the future, so at default locktimes could be disabled for assetchains, right?

[06-Jan-20 04:58 PM] jorian#4555
i'm digging the agama source to find out where it sets the locktime

[06-Jan-20 04:59 PM] jorian#4555
seems to be it, but it's in `electrum` folder, where i am signing it using agama native

[06-Jan-20 05:00 PM] jorian#4555
i'll go bug the verus community with this tomorrow

[06-Jan-20 05:07 PM] akshaynexus#3840
hey guys,question,what does cryptocondition do?saw a bounty for it,trying to understand how it differs from a normal tx or other op codes

hmm, apparently Agama already sets the locktime to 15 minutes ago, but it's still giving me non-final

[06-Jan-20 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
when was 8 blocks ago?

[06-Jan-20 05:44 PM] jorian#4555
Right, sorry

[06-Jan-20 05:44 PM] jorian#4555
On demand chain

[06-Jan-20 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
generate 10 blocks, then it will work

[06-Jan-20 10:33 PM] riemdelhi#7234
Hello World, I have a question to the Tutorial stuff. I have really low programmer skills, therefore sorry for stupid questions.

Q: I can't find the Website-Link to the Tutorials 2-5 for trying on Docker like TUT1. Is there a guide for this?

Thanks for your help! üôÇ
