are you the one that tries to sell VRSC for KMD?
if so... `taker_swap:541] Started_at time_dif over 60 123`... looks like the clock on your device is off, so no swaps will start

[06-Jan-20 12:12 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
yes

[06-Jan-20 12:12 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
oh

[06-Jan-20 12:13 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
i set it up to automatic i close the app and retry

[06-Jan-20 12:14 AM] cipi#4502
ok, give me one minute to restart the maker node before you retry... my node banned your pubkey

[06-Jan-20 12:14 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
ok thanks

[06-Jan-20 12:16 AM] cipi#4502
ok, done... pubkey unbanned with restart

[06-Jan-20 12:16 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
ill try now

Order Matching step 0/3

[06-Jan-20 12:18 AM] cipi#4502
looks like another maker catched that trade... can't watch it live... but i will see the error on the seed node if it happens again

[06-Jan-20 12:18 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
i cancel that one?

[06-Jan-20 12:19 AM] cipi#4502
no, let it run

[06-Jan-20 12:19 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
ok thanks

[06-Jan-20 12:19 AM] cipi#4502
if the clock is fixed, it should finish successfully

[06-Jan-20 12:19 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
it says the same time

[06-Jan-20 12:19 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
but its automatic now

[06-Jan-20 12:20 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
and i could see the list of orders now while before i couldnt

[06-Jan-20 12:21 AM] cipi#4502
i don't know what the tolerance is, maybe you haven't noticed the change

[06-Jan-20 12:21 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
no the hour is the same on my phone

[06-Jan-20 12:21 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
it was just set manually

[06-Jan-20 12:22 AM] cipi#4502
i think the problem will be there even if the difference is only couple of seconds

[06-Jan-20 12:22 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
ok

[06-Jan-20 12:28 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, problem can also be that the other nodes banned you too
i have an ask with price 0.15something in the orderbook, which is more then the cheapest offer... but if the node with the cheaper offer banned you, the swap will not make it... i you only want to try it out, you can buy a tiny amount of my offer, just to test

[06-Jan-20 12:28 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
maybe i find the error is in my router time?

[06-Jan-20 12:28 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
can this affect it?

[06-Jan-20 12:29 AM] cipi#4502
sure, if the device you are swapping from is using the router as time source

[06-Jan-20 12:30 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
i don't see your order

[06-Jan-20 12:31 AM] cipi#4502
```
    {
      "coin": "VRSC",
      "address": "RT9MpMyucqXiX8bZLimXBnrrn2ofmdGNKd",

      "age": 2,
      "zcredits": 0
    }
```
i can see this ask on CLI from another node

[06-Jan-20 12:31 AM] cipi#4502
and i see the cheaper offer is gone üôÇ

[06-Jan-20 12:32 AM] cipi#4502
oh wait, you are trying to sell VRSC, not buy... my fault

[06-Jan-20 12:32 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
yes

[06-Jan-20 12:33 AM] cipi#4502
ok, on the buy side, there are many offers... mine is this
```
    {
      "coin": "KMD",
      "address": "RT9MpMyucqXiX8bZLimXBnrrn2ofmdGNKd",
      "price": "0.1113104977717413748536836029221458948453000078993720953671701492413642485759277194864056605947394919",

      "age": 3,
      "zcredits": 0
    },
```
and is the best offer, so if your node sees it too, it should pick that one up

[06-Jan-20 12:34 AM] cipi#4502
ok it started
`negotiation@197525cf-a953-4576-991d-53ed99a33953`

[06-Jan-20 12:34 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
step 1/3

[06-Jan-20 12:34 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
ill let it run

[06-Jan-20 12:34 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
i think i am on the right order

[06-Jan-20 12:35 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
yes

[06-Jan-20 12:35 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
thanks a lot for the first time

[06-Jan-20 12:35 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
it went to step 2/3

[06-Jan-20 12:35 AM] cipi#4502
cool... and i see makerpayment... should complete... the clock was the problem

[06-Jan-20 12:36 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
thanks

[06-Jan-20 12:36 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
that helps a lot

[06-Jan-20 12:53 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
yes it still not going thru üò¢

[06-Jan-20 12:54 AM] cipi#4502
it takes long, but it advanced
your node just sent TakerPayment: `06 00:52:00, maker_swap:492] Received 'taker-payment@197525cf-a953-4576-991d-53ed99a33953' (242 bytes, crc 921026258)`

[06-Jan-20 12:54 AM] cipi#4502
now my node waits for 2 confirmations of the tx 2861fc2c9479aafba7abd5d80978f7a5ce91589cf31f08f5c1a539ffd1b18d01 on VRSC chain

[06-Jan-20 12:54 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
nice

[06-Jan-20 12:55 AM] alcestecaulfield#9377
trade completed

[06-Jan-20 12:55 AM] cipi#4502
```

hi there just slowly learning more about and using atomicdex, have a question (thanks for the answers yesterday by the way)
As far as the transaction fee in a transaction (aka network fee that goes to miners on chain) which side pays this, the maker, taker or both? 

Am I correct in assuming it is both, of which the fee is taken from each leg of the transaction's journey? i.e. tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade, tx fee #2 from taker sending to hold address, tx fee #3 sending from hold address to maker, tx fee #4 from maker to holding address and finally tx fee #5 from holding address to taker.

In this case, for the transaction fee that is displayed in app when setting up a trade (for instance 0.00006038 btc for a btc trade right now) is that amount an estimate for total needed for all 5 payments to go through, or is that the fee for each tx (so for maker would be the above fee * 2, the taker would be the above fee * 3?)

correct
>  i.e. tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade, tx fee #2 from taker sending to hold address, tx fee #3 sending from hold address to maker, tx fee #4 from maker to holding address and finally tx fee #5 from holding address to taker.

it should be tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade (chain A),  tx fee #2 from maker sending to intermediate address(maker payment, chain B),  tx fee #3 from taker sending to intermediate address(taker payment, chain A) , tx fee #4 maker claim (chain A), tx fee #5 taker claim(chain B)

[06-Jan-20 08:47 AM] gcharang#6833
> for instance 0.00006038 btc for a btc trade right now
it is for the dexfee and taker payment

[06-Jan-20 08:50 AM] CiPhEr#2091
ok so in my app it lists 0.00006038 btc for tx fee separately from 0.00001596 for trading fee (1/777) dex fee

[06-Jan-20 08:50 AM] CiPhEr#2091
so i guess the 0.00006038 i as a maker would pay twice and the taker would pay it three times

[06-Jan-20 08:51 AM] CiPhEr#2091
and i (as a maker) wouldn't pay the trading fee as only takers pay that fee i believe

[06-Jan-20 09:05 AM] gcharang#6833
not quite
you see, taker pays tx fee twice(dexfee and taker payment) on chain A, once(taker claim) on chain B (I think, the fee for taker claim is taken from the amount maker has already locked)
maker  pays tx fee once(maker payment) on chain B, once(maker claim) on chain A

I really like the music in the AtomicDEX during an order (IOS). What kind of song is that.  I would like it.

@wolzie , "during an order" is ambiguous. as of now the following modes are in place: when we've just created an order we're in a "taker" mode, after 30 seconds and no match we switch into a "maker" mode, and if we've matched and the swap is ongoing then we're in an "active swap" mode. the sound files where provided by various members of the team so we'll need some investigative work to pinpoint the origin.
