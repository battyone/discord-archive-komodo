@richardt True. Unfortunately there are even less people willing to spend money to make their investments more valuable, or support efforts to do that.

I'm a little surprised. Last month, you guys seem pretty confident that Hyperdex would be released in December. How did it go from that to now needing volunteers to move the project forward or "let Hyperdex die"?

we can't release it as is, it needs active people to offer support, work out bugs and do some marketing. if none of that is available, it just stops being an option

I see. Hope you guys find the help you need. Hyperdex looked promising

I'd encourage anyone interested to read the code and learn / contribute if they have the time or inclination - especially prospective notary node candidates heading into the next election. Contributions like this are worthy of earning some votes and demonstrating capability. Maybe you dont get paid directly working on a community project, but investing your time pays of in skills growth and future opportunities.
