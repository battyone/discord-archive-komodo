trading volumes are very low last six months and you are talking about some kind of pumps and until we see an increase in trading volumes following an increase in prices, this is not growth, but the speculation is ridiculous to see something in it! There is a constant issue of coins by miners and stakeholders with lack of demand from large investors, as there is currently no REAL use of the coin, so at least until the launch of DEFI on the platform and the KMD credit system with freezing, we will not see any growth and demand and the price will remain wallow close to the bottom!

I think all it takes is 1 big social media personality or page mod to see potential and start sharing komodo around

[06-Jan-20 10:19 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Those type of things usually cause big chain reactions and bring a loot of new investors and attention in

Usually it tapers and dies down after a few months or year due to vapourware or unkept promises / no development

[06-Jan-20 10:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But with komodo. I think one day it will happen, and new people who come into Komodo will see the dev and stay ðŸ˜‚

KMD should get Tether to issue USDT on a smart chain, i watched a interview with the CTO from Bitfinex/Tether and he said that they already have issued or are issuing USDT on Omni, Eth, Tron, Eos and Liquid and he also mentioned that they are constantly looking to expand

KMD (3)

that would be great given USDT  trading volume and its actual use would be a good promotion for Komodo

our project lacks only marketing but marketing not at the level of my and your repost on twitter or like on facebook, but marketing of that level when people recognizable not only in the crypto party but also outside it associated with the generation of millenials talk about it, therefore convince the creators of snapchat or Jack Dorsey and the like, that Komodo technogy is not an alternative to Bitcoin, but his assistant and a great thing for their applications and that such people sometimes mention Komodo

Could usdt be used to make usdt-k? Essentially using a stable coin to make a loan into a Komodo stable coin.

one of the team members recently  mentioned working with Celsius which i think would be a good thing and within the scope of possibility.  Celsius Network is trying to add staking/reward coins and it supports a lot of stable coins too...  it would be a small step, but one in the right direction and one that shouldnt be too hard to make.
