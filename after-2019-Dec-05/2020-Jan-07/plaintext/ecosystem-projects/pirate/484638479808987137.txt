[dscrd-prt] <mineyourbiz> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ your manners are fine. I beg your pardon- I should have phrased it differently: SAFE is a direct fork of KMD.

[06-Jan-20 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mineyourbiz> A variant of dPOW was being seriously evaluated by Jeff & his team as far back as Sept/Oct 2018, so I took for granted he was at least on friendly terms with the KMD team.

[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> Sietch is a good mitigation by increasing the combinatorics needed to extract the transaction graph. also making all transactions look the same, it is a good measure. it would only have significant value to a z->z chain. while it would still be theoretically possible to brute force the transaction graph, at some point it becomes impractical. its not just how big your anon set it, it is how you use it that also matters

[06-Jan-20 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> You guys should see my anon set!

[06-Jan-20 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> but you can't, it's private

[06-Jan-20 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> someone make a classy meme about that

[06-Jan-20 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> @mineyourbiz yes, it was "a direct fork", far more than they wanted it to be and that was Jeff and Jeff's first thing they were mad at Komodo about.

[06-Jan-20 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> who knows what needs to be done is technically difficult to add ledger nano to a cold wallet and is work being done to resolve this issue?

[06-Jan-20 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> that was a great mention from John McAfee and I have a feeling not the last. :pirate: 

Perhaps everyone is starting to understand now, even those lowly ppl that cannot calculate an anonset understand that the only possible privacy is BY DEFAULT.

[06-Jan-20 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> end of story

[06-Jan-20 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> and it is good that after several years, other ecosystem projects, are waking up to that fact

[06-Jan-20 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> If you want to find the most anonymous and private cryptocurrency you have to consider the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Is it protected by zk-SNARKS encryption technology? (which is the strongest)
2Ô∏è‚É£ How large is the anonymity set?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Does it offer privacy by default as standard?
4Ô∏è‚É£ Are ALL the transactions private?
5Ô∏è‚É£ Is the blockchain protected from attacks and how?
6Ô∏è‚É£ Is mining private?

[06-Jan-20 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> thats how it is man. the coins with the most markets are the ones who break free from btc first

[06-Jan-20 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> im guesssing one or two more dominant cycles for BTC

[06-Jan-20 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> then its break free time for those who have a lot of markets

[06-Jan-20 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> yes, because I distinctly recall reading in history books that every viable currency began with centralized trading markets

[dscrd-prt] <Hember> here in finland it is better to just go into the cold showers especially in the winter. If you don't take them your body doesn't adapt to the coldness outside and then you hate the outside... and that isn't ever a good thing.
