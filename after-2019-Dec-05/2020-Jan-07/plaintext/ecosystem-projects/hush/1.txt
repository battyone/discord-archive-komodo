[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I get  connection error in SDL 10061

[06-Jan-20 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @Captain Choose `lite.myhush.org`under settings as server and restart. This should help

[06-Jan-20 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> How does Sietch work? It adds a burn address output to all transactions with 0,0001 going to that addr?

[06-Jan-20 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @scubapanda No it adds no burn address (a burn would make this mitigiation useless). It adds transaction with amount=0 to Sietch zaddr in a very special way. But there is no burn. In fact it stay on these addresses maybe forever

[06-Jan-20 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jan-20 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Good read, thanks! So if I understood correctly, the cpu time (and diskspace?) requirement per single z->z tx is roughly 3x after Sietch? Does the user hold the keys to the sietch addresses, ie could one use the memofields in the 5 sietch tx to store some useful data onchain?

[06-Jan-20 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Yes, you have a increase in cpu time, and due to bigger blocksizes the Blockchain will get bigger then now. Speedwise we talk about 2-3sec a transaction needs longer now (depends on your cpu).

[06-Jan-20 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> No the User does not hold the privatekey to the sietch zaddr pool. In fact he has no benefit to hold them, since you send no amount to this addresses (amount=0 transactions). Its necessary that this addresses will not be touch (or spend any nullfiers).

[06-Jan-20 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> The Memofield feature you mention in interesting, and in fact we develop atm a Chatgui for our Wallets, who will allow that

[06-Jan-20 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Ok, so how are the sietch addresses generated so no-one has the keys after the tx is sent?

[06-Jan-20 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> the sietch addr, is in fact a big zaddr Pool (in SDL 10.000 zaddr) which duke and i create and put in. This Addresses will shuffle for sure over time (we can easy replace them). So we have the private keys, but its necessary for our mitigation to not spend any nullfier from this pool zaddr (and they have Amount 0 anyway). So they are just "Dust" addresses

[06-Jan-20 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> As you can imagine, we generate a great deal of fog. To see through this fog would cost a fortune in analysis. So from a certain point on it makes no sense for these companies to analyze our data

[06-Jan-20 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Sietch deprives this analysis of one of its most important fundamentals, the economic efficiency of it

[06-Jan-20 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> So you control addresses/priv keys where you'll receive 5 tx of 0 hush every time I send z->z and that increases my privacy.

[06-Jan-20 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> we add 7-9 extra 0 amount tx, to increase privacy, yes exactly

[06-Jan-20 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> it will increase both. Your privacy for every tx you make, and the privacy of the whole blockchain

[06-Jan-20 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> ..and if you would decide to publish the private keys you hold?

[06-Jan-20 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> and then?

[06-Jan-20 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> what could we do with a addr with 0 amount?

[06-Jan-20 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> The whole idea of Sietch is, to not touch this zaddr. It would destroy the fog

[06-Jan-20 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> I understand the last part, yes. What I don't understand is that could the sietch pool private keys be used in an 'evil' way if given out ie. is there trust involved in this.

[06-Jan-20 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @scubapanda What are you thinking about ?

[06-Jan-20 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> no i could not use them in a evil way. In fact it needs the same trust as before. When you send a transaction the receiver will know your taddr. This leaks some Metadata.

[06-Jan-20 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> So you will know every zaddress that sent a tx?

[06-Jan-20 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> explain this please

[06-Jan-20 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> `When you send a transaction the receiver will know your zaddr.`

[06-Jan-20 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> sorry, i mean taddr

[06-Jan-20 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> zaddr are unknown

[06-Jan-20 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> ok

[06-Jan-20 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> thats why Hush will go z2z full in future

[06-Jan-20 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> taddr is not the best choice for privacy

[06-Jan-20 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> And your private keys couldn't be used in ITM anaysis to exclude the sietch transactions from the analysis?

[06-Jan-20 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Every Privatekey you give out to Analysis company will decrease the privacy. But you hold your own privkey. We dont hold them.

[06-Jan-20 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Every piece of data they can get, will increase privacy. Its all about linking data for them

[06-Jan-20 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> I meant these private keys: `the sietch addr, is in fact a big zaddr Pool (in SDL 10.000 zaddr) which duke and i create and put in. This Addresses will shuffle for sure over time (we can easy replace them). So we have the private keys, but its necessary for our mitigation to not spend any nullfier from this pool zaddr (and they have Amount 0 anyway). So they are just "Dust" addresses`

[06-Jan-20 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> They would just tell that a transaction to a sietch addr happend. It tells not from which zaddr, it tells not to which zaddr you send, It shows no amount if z-z

[06-Jan-20 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Ok, I don't pretend to understand all this but I thought ITM analysis could use this info if they had the keys.

[06-Jan-20 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Thanks for your time! Got to go now, back later.

[06-Jan-20 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Sietch is brand new. We appreciate questions about it üëç Everyone should understand, why this increase the amount of privacy for Hush, and why its important for every zprivacy coin to prevent Meta Data leaks

[06-Jan-20 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> actually scubapanda is onto something

[06-Jan-20 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> anybody who has the global zaddr privkeys, could make viewkeys and then all tx with these zaddr can be directly seen

[06-Jan-20 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it seems better to locally generate a set of burn keys that is not added to the wallet

[06-Jan-20 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c @scubapanda these are good questions I can add some explanation to. You are right that the larger the zpool, the more that people use their own custom one, the better

[06-Jan-20 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My original plan was every full node to dynamicaly generate and manage their zpool, but that was not viable for this "v0"

[06-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So we have a few different interacting bits of info here

[06-Jan-20 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> @denio changed it to lite.myhush.org, now sdl just keeps crashing after restart

[06-Jan-20 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> oh yes, one sec. One server is down i see

[06-Jan-20 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Firstly, with help of @denio that I didn't know I needed, there is no "global zpool privkeys", because hushd and SDL use different sets. I didn't realize it, but SDL uses raw transactions, which mean it doesn't use hushd z_sendmany, which means @denio wrote his own Sietch implementation, with his own zpools!

[06-Jan-20 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I call the current code we have "Sietch v0" and it definitely takes some shortcuts that will be improved, I am getting lots of good feedback, especially from jl777

[06-Jan-20 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You will notice my sietch documentation does not talk about the specifics of "sietch v0", it kept changing. The current code of sietch v0 is just one possible way, and I can already see many improvements

[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I always wanted to have dynamic zpools and that will come with the next version

[06-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tip.cc> :HUSH: @dukeleto sent @scubapanda **25.00 HUSH** (‚âà $1.20).

[06-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for good questions and point out valid issues

[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `I understand the last part, yes. What I don't understand is that could the sietch pool private keys be used in an 'evil' way if given out ie. is there trust involved in this.`

[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The answer is yes, either Duke can become evil and de-anon Hush or the wallet can be stolen from me and others could try!

[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Let's examine how bad this would be, it's fun.

[06-Jan-20 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And to preface, I knew of this issue, but didn't have a performant solution to it (until recently). It will be fixed, because we want to make things as optimal as we can. Also, this attack would basically bring us back to pre-Sietch privacy, kind of like turning off DPoW brings you back to no dpow security

[06-Jan-20 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, people trust the genesis block I mined and the codebase I maintain, so me becoming evil is possible, but it's not quite interesting.

[06-Jan-20 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If I was evil, I could much more easily backdoor Hush code. The much more interesting case is evil people stealing this wallet.dat and de-anon'ing Hush in secret.

[06-Jan-20 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What could they do? How bad is it?

[06-Jan-20 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Well, as I saw @denio explain a bit, very very little metadata can be extracted from *received* Sietch xtns. You won't know what address sent them, and they will be amount=0 and have an empty memo field. BUT there are probably a dozen unique identifiers in the deep zcash internals of the transaction, and it's timestamp and fee (which is transparent)

[06-Jan-20 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, you couldn't immediately say "Oh wow, zaddr X sent A to B", none of that data is there. But you could collect all sietch xtns and "subtract" them from all xtns on the chain!

[06-Jan-20 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not even transactions, but you would need to go inside every xtn, and subtract out the variable amount of zutxos in that xtn to sietch zaddrs

[06-Jan-20 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This would be easy with the stolen wallet.dat, basically a blockchain analysis company would take that wallet.dat as input and then know how to subtract all sietch zutxos in real-time

[06-Jan-20 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> (No remember, currently hushd uses 200 sietch zaddrs and SDL uses 10,000, so that is 10,200 zaddrs they would need to get access to currently

[06-Jan-20 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, with both of these stolen wallet.dats, somebody would need pretty large resources still, to launch an ITM-style attack

[06-Jan-20 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is a long way of saying: `TLDR`: Current worst-case for Hush sietch zaddr privkeys being stolen is being reduced to pre-Sietch privacy, not anything worse. The same as every other coin currently has üôÇ

[06-Jan-20 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Thanks for the explanation! One more question... Why not just send all the sietch 0 value ztx to a single burn address? If no private key exists no-one can tell the difference?

[06-Jan-20 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda it seems safer for every node/wallet to generate dynamic throwaway burn addresses (as many as it needs to hit the minimum zout requirement of 7 in Sietch)

[06-Jan-20 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda malware or a bad person could steal the privkey to that single burn zaddr, somehow, against our will

[06-Jan-20 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But if every node/user makes new ones constantly, and never stores the privkey in a wallet.dat, I think that reduces the attack surface greatly

[06-Jan-20 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I always wanted to do something like this. My idea is each node/wallet would maintain it's own set of sietch zaddrs. Making them in every xtn seems even better

[06-Jan-20 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also was just told that @denio used a paper wallet to make the 10K zaddrs in SDL-Sietch, so there is no wallet.dat to steal! üéâ

[06-Jan-20 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @denio 100 hush

[06-Jan-20 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jan-20 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for doing stuff better than me üòâ

[06-Jan-20 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda just as an example, if there were only 1 global privkey, there is no way I can prove it to say, Monero Core devs, that I actually deleted it

[06-Jan-20 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They would never believe me!!!! ü§°

[06-Jan-20 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> I agree with the above you wrote. I was just wondering if was possible to create a zaddress that provably doesn't have a private key and send the sietch ztx to that address.

[06-Jan-20 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda the answer is yes

[06-Jan-20 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have talked about this exact edge case with James for hours üôÇ

[06-Jan-20 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda there is risk that it would be possible to tell this "unspenabled" zaddr from a valid one, perhaps only in the future do to things we don't know

[06-Jan-20 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So in theory, yes, I think I could make a list of zaddrs, and make one unspendable and I don't *THINK* anybody could tell which was unspendable

[06-Jan-20 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But I don't have 100% proof of that.

[06-Jan-20 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> üôÇ

[06-Jan-20 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So James and I concluded valid zaddrs are safer, there is 0% chance a blockchain analyst could say "this is not a valid zaddr", because it is valid

[06-Jan-20 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> I'm happy with that üôÇ

[06-Jan-20 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's great to get constructive feedback that improves Sietch, I couldn't be happier

[06-Jan-20 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I knew Sietch v0 was not perfect, I didn't know it would be improving so fast!
