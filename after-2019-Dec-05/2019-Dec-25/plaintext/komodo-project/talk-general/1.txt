My Komodo is in Agama mobile wallet is this ok to leave there for this update?

mobile uses SPV (lite mode). Only full nodes need to update.

backup your seed tho, its just good practice. Then checkout  AtomicDEX

[24-Dec-19 06:59 AM] gcharang#6833
@StrikerBurns backup your seed phrase and switch to using the AtomicDEX mobile or the Verus mobile wallet 
Agama mobile isn't supported anymore

[24-Dec-19 09:45 AM] StrikerBurns#3846
I use Agama desktop

[24-Dec-19 10:38 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, you can use your Agama Mobile's seed directly in Agama desktop to access your address
<https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed>
use the latest version of Verus Agama from here: <https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html>

can anyone point me to a guide or an article with the info on removing the kmd full node from linux via cli

[24-Dec-19 11:03 AM] gcharang#6833
you just want to delete komodo full node?

just delete the drectory you might have cloned. It should be named "komodo"
and the blockchain data files will be in `~/.komodo`
you might want to save the wallet.dat file. It contains your private keys

just delete those two directories after backing up your wallet.dat
note that, deleting the `~/.komodo` directory also deletes wallet.dat and blockchain data of all the Komodo Smart Chains too

@gcharang exactly, thanks man! I haven't updated like in ages, and I recon better to start clean after the recent upgrade

[24-Dec-19 11:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@NedBGQ you really don't need to delete everything to start over

[24-Dec-19 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you don't ~~want~~need to delete data to update daemon

[24-Dec-19 11:07 AM] NedBGQ#8462
ok, I haven't found any info on this on my own, I'm grateful for any tips and how-tos

[24-Dec-19 11:07 AM] gcharang#6833
do you have a directory named komodo in your Home directory?

[24-Dec-19 11:07 AM] NedBGQ#8462
yes, sure

[24-Dec-19 11:09 AM] gcharang#6833
ok,
```
cd ~/komodo
git checkout master
git pull
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
that should give you the upto date komodo daemon

FYI

[24-Dec-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, do one thing
don't delete the "dot komodo" directory, but delete the `~/komodo` directory
and follow the installation instructions here: <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/installing-from-source.html#linux>

[24-Dec-19 11:14 AM] NedBGQ#8462
ok, will do, thanks for the help !

[24-Dec-19 11:15 AM] gcharang#6833
