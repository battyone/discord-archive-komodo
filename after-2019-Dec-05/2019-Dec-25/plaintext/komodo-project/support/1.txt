Heya.  I put a swap in for vrsc in the Android wallet, ended up cancelling the order, and now the vrsc is nowhere to be found.  Further, there

[24-Dec-19 04:30 PM] icusu#5683
The vrsc wallet isn't even showing up in the assets page.  Are the funds just gone?

[24-Dec-19 04:46 PM] gcharang#6833
@icusu they are not gone
if you leave the app open, you should get the coins back automatically in about 4 hours

[24-Dec-19 04:53 PM] icusu#5683
Closing the app change that?

[24-Dec-19 04:55 PM] gcharang#6833
if you close the app, it might take around half an hour the next time you open it for the refund to happen (assuming 4 hours have passed)

[24-Dec-19 04:56 PM] icusu#5683
10-4.  Any idea why vrsc isn't showing in the assets page even if I try adding it again?

[24-Dec-19 05:01 PM] gcharang#6833
there has been a network upgrade for VRSC and maybe the SPV servers aren't responding properly
the issue should be fixed in sometime

> 10-4

[24-Dec-19 05:02 PM] icusu#5683
