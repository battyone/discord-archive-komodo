@blackjok3r @jl777c I made the priority of tx with setting max priority to 1e16. But something seems to be chaning the priority of the tx. I put this priority on two places, in miner.cpp and in main.cpp AcceptToMemoeryPool (view.GetPriority()). Are there some other places where the priority of tx can be changed?

At some point I have priority to 1e16 but then it changes, sometimes some big number sometimes 0.

I've put this in miner near the end of parsing a tx in block:
```cpp
// Priority is sum(valuein * age) / modified_txsize
            unsigned int nTxSize = ::GetSerializeSize(tx, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION);
            dPriority = tx.ComputePriority(dPriority, nTxSize);

            uint256 hash = tx.GetHash();
            mempool.ApplyDeltas(hash, dPriority, nTotalIn);

            CFeeRate feeRate(nTotalIn-tx.GetValueOut(), nTxSize);

----->>>    if (tx.vout.size()>0 && tx.IsPriorityCC()) dPriority=1e16;```

[24-Dec-19 03:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
And in GetPriority() called from main in AcceptToMemoryPool:
```cpp
if (tx.vjoinsplit.size() > 0 || tx.vShieldedSpend.size() > 0 || tx.vShieldedOutput.size() > 0 || tx.IsCoinImport() || tx.IsPegsImport() || tx.IsPriorityCC()) {
        return MAX_PRIORITY;
    }```

[24-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ahh, I had a problem with extracting eval code from vout

[24-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
Now they all have 1e16 priority

[24-Dec-19 04:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, but when I start mining they switch to 0 priority

[24-Dec-19 04:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm it seems that only when I start mining it sets current txs in mempool to 0, then after adding new ones it stays on 1e16

[24-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
No, at some point they go to 0
