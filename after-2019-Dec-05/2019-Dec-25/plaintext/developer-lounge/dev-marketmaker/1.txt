has anyone tested mm2 with native coin daemons? can't get RICK or MORTY to show balance after `enable`ing them. using electrum, i see balance just fine

using macOS mojave and a mm2 version that i built today

@jorian search this topic, I discussed it, 1 or 2 lines should be adapted in mm2

Oh sorry I am confused, I was thinking about remote coin daemons

I have done, but not for a while

make sure using latest coins file. what json is returned when activating? are chains sync'd?

[24-Dec-19 04:18 PM] jorian#4555
Yes, synced. Might need to check coins file indeed, but itâ€™s not that old
