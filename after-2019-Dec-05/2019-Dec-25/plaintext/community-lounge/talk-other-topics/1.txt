The Power Law model by @hcburger1 has a nice property: The inclination angle for all 3 bull markets is 45¬∞ on the log log chart. Multiplying the base angle with the golden ratio = 45¬∞ too.

A 45¬∞ angle from Dec 2018 to the upper line leads to an ATH of $200k at the end ...

If anyone tries to accuse bitcoin of being centralized, would Satoshi jump on Twitter to defend it? No. That is decentralization. 

We don‚Äôt care.

Exit scams are still insanely popular, and the latest is a BitMEX BTC fund promising large returns.

The final message from the manager read, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs life, my darling.‚Äù (See image).

Nearly $400,000 worth, at least, of BTC vanished recently.

Pro physical stablecoin post
```Banks are issuing more notes than ever and yet they seem to be disappearing off the face of the earth.......

The puzzle is especially perplexing since societies and companies are going cashless......

Cash has become king```
How many crypto users are there? How many cash users are there? Tell me again why it doesn't make sense for a physical stablecoin.

[24-Dec-19 05:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it doesn't have to be physical

[24-Dec-19 05:38 PM] joe2x4#5987
Yes, digital will work just fine. However, my belief is that a digital stablecoin that can also be a physical stablecoin is the road for Mass adoption. Maybe my belief is different due to living in a rural settling, as many many people around me use cash as much as possible.  However, the above quoted article, illustrates that people horde physical cash, not digital. This to me says that they inherently trust cash more. I guess what I'm trying to convey is difficult as people on here are very techy, however you techy people are a very very very small section of society. Most of what crypto people talk about is confusing as hell to pretty much everyone else. But everyone else does know how to use cash. Why not present the tech to everyone else in a format they understand?

wait for another 15-20 years & everyone will switch over to digital payments with cash or crypto, it is just a matter of time as the younger generation will start to replace the older one. üòÇ 
to my knowledge I don't think it is feasible to make physical crypto bills, it should be at least a hardware wallet with the ability to sign & send transactions.

tldr "I hope my predictions age better than Armstrong's and anonymint's"

[24-Dec-19 06:28 PM] joe2x4#5987
I hope you are right allbits. The predictions of the two if become correct mean the world just went to shit. I do like to hear different points of view though, even if they become wrong, helps point out better views.

[24-Dec-19 06:32 PM] allbits#5898
They've been getting apocalyptic predictions wrong for years. They are easily ignored

[24-Dec-19 06:33 PM] joe2x4#5987
Fair enough, Anonymint is blind in one eye and is dying of some disease, which should be taken into account to his predictions.

[24-Dec-19 06:34 PM] joe2x4#5987
Phba2061, I acknowledge that you may be correct about people switching over to digital in 15-20 years. Last time I went to a city and tried to buy gas with a $100 bill they couldn't make change. However, as taxes continue to become absurd it leads to people using cash or barter for job payment just to help make ends meet. And if no cash locally than CES can be used. ```https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Exchange_System``` https://nymag.com/news/features/tide-detergent-drugs-2013-1/
Oldie but who could have predicted that tide would be used as cash? I don't necessarily think it's possible to eliminate cash

Expensive yes, but there are various solutions being worked on. In it's simplest form, a book of paperwallets (with key covered by tamperproof sticker ,must trust manufacturer) could be used. Think checkbook. Don't some areas use checks and trust as payments. The check exchanges hands many times as there is a trust inherent to the original issuer. Marmara?
