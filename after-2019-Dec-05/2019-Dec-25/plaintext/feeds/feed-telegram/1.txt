[telegram] <Regnar> I'm a firm believer in making new addresses, not restoring. (re @D0geking: Or better don't do it for the moment?)

[24-Dec-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Hot garbage (re @Suzycrabgrass: What did I even read)

[24-Dec-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> The spam is getting ridiculously stupid üòÇ

[24-Dec-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yup! (re @D0geking: When desktop dex is finished, it will serve as a wallet in itself, right?)

[24-Dec-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Haha it's always been stupid

[24-Dec-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> I want to meet one person who falls for these

[24-Dec-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Hahah üòÇ old people here buying crypto and using telegram (re @Regnar: I knew someone whose mother bought into Onecoin)

[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Plus token running with 2.9 billion is ridiculous. Make me wonder why legit projects cant grow üòÇüòÇ (re @Regnar: I knew someone whose mother bought into Onecoin)

[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Makes sense (re @Regnar: Haha yea, I mean they sold her on it in person.)

[24-Dec-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But yea I did see a pretty elaborate scam earlier this week.

[telegram] <Regnar> ^^

[24-Dec-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Forwarded from Regnar: Might be the most elaborate scam I've seen in some time. It's a "live" video of Vitalik Buterin talking about ETH and is cropped onto a screen of an ETH explorer with an ETH giveaway QR code you "send" to... there's thousands watching the video and it's on a YouTube Channel called Ethereum with like 15k subscribers, but no other content.
Scam

[24-Dec-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Basically made the background explorer/giveaway code look like the presentation screen of a "live" broadcast

[24-Dec-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Wow üòÇüò± (re @Regnar: Might be the most elaborate scam I've seen in some time.

[24-Dec-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Oh dude. Deep fakes of Vitalik Buterin doing ETH giveaways. (re @Suzycrabgrass: What's next? Deep fakes, ai voice creation, and a forked ethereum with fake coins üòÇüòÇ)

[telegram] <Acura360> We found, fixed, and confirmed this issue last night. Again, the last critical release was 0.6.0-6, and the only difference between that version and this is that this one will always properly submit stakes that are found.
Merry Christmas / Christmas Eve to all who celebrate, and for those who don't, we hope you are enjoying the Holidays!
