```Banks are issuing more notes than ever and yet they seem to be disappearing off the face of the earth.......

The puzzle is especially perplexing since societies and companies are going cashless......

Cash has become king```
How many crypto users are there? How many cash users are there? Tell me again why it doesn't make sense for a physical stablecoin.","",""

"466679763491225600","joe2x4#5987","24-Dec-19 05:38 PM","Yes, digital will work just fine. However, my belief is that a digital stablecoin that can also be a physical stablecoin is the road for Mass adoption. Maybe my belief is different due to living in a rural settling, as many many people around me use cash as much as possible.  However, the above quoted article, illustrates that people horde physical cash, not digital. This to me says that they inherently trust cash more. I guess what I'm trying to convey is difficult as people on here are very techy, however you techy people are a very very very small section of society. Most of what crypto people talk about is confusing as hell to pretty much everyone else. But everyone else does know how to use cash. Why not present the tech to everyone else in a format they understand?","",""

Last time I went to a city and tried to buy gas with a $100 bill they couldn't make change. However, as taxes continue to become absurd it leads to people using cash or barter for job payment just to help make ends meet. And if no cash locally than CES can be used. ```https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Exchange_System``` https://nymag.com/news/features/tide-detergent-drugs-2013-1/

Expensive yes, but there are various solutions being worked on. In it's simplest form, a book of paperwallets (with key covered by tamperproof sticker ,must trust manufacturer) could be used. Think checkbook. Don't some areas use checks and trust as payments. The check exchanges hands many times as there is a trust inherent to the original issuer. Marmara?","",""
