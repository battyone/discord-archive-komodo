"423176312354635779","gcharang#6833","24-Dec-19 11:03 AM","you just want to delete komodo full node?

just delete the drectory you might have cloned. It should be named ""komodo""
and the blockchain data files will be in `~/.komodo`
you might want to save the wallet.dat file. It contains your private keys

just delete those two directories after backing up your wallet.dat
note that, deleting the `~/.komodo` directory also deletes wallet.dat and blockchain data of all the Komodo Smart Chains too
