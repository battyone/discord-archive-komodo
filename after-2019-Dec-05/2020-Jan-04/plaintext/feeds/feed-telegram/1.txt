[03-Jan-20 11:33 AM] gcharang#6833
QT wallet only has native mode
and creating a new transaction will create a new address by default
you also have to backup your wallet.dat after every transaction. do you understand this and still want to use it?

[03-Jan-20 11:35 AM] gcharang#6833
if you just need the Agama wallet. download the latest verus Agama wallet from https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html

[telegram] <Regnar> Yea some wallets opt for claim buttons but they don't do anything special because the rewards are at the blockchain level and have very little (though some) to do with specific wallets you use.
So simply sending the balance to yourself is how you manually claim, and how "claim buttons" claim for you.
Here is some more information about how the rewards system works.
