[dscrd-prt] <kaks> Thank you captain

[03-Jan-20 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> oh, i also forgot to mention, they emailed us from @hotbit.io

[03-Jan-20 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> which is their legit acount

[03-Jan-20 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> however, it was spoofed

[03-Jan-20 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ZaferGraph> at least not so much big hit, think about komodoworld

[03-Jan-20 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> yeah seriously, i felt really bad for komodoworld

[03-Jan-20 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> komodoworld was like heart attacküòï

[03-Jan-20 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <kaks> they need italian pizza to forget it XD

[03-Jan-20 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> i just figured i'd be upfront and honest with everyone, I don't like hiding things from the community

[03-Jan-20 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> I mean, it isn't like this was you responding to an email stating that your iCloud account is breached

[03-Jan-20 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> i know, but it's the fact that i lost community funds. If it was my own funds, i wouldn't be as upset about it.

[03-Jan-20 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> i take a great deal of pride in the trust that i'm given with handling funds

[03-Jan-20 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @Draeth Sucks that you got scammed. These low lives are disgusting. We also got a few of these offers. I think one was from KuCoin. What I learned. Big exchanges normally don't contact you on their own. And always and I mean ALWAYS check the MX records for the mail. As you noticed its to easy to spoof the "from" address

[03-Jan-20 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> It was weird to me that they only wanted 50K coins, but I did not want to get involved in your internal workings. Next time I promise I will not be quiet üò¶

[03-Jan-20 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I'm creating a channel where different kinds of ARRR material will be stored for anyone and everyone to use on their social media and arrrticles. As people spam new material here, they may immediately tell me to put it in on the channel or I may come and ask if it is OK to put it there. I will include the nick if the creator and anything else that needs to be included. Which do you think, is a good name for this channel? Give a suggestion or react to this post accordingly:
Give ‚ù§Ô∏è  if PirateChain, give üëå if ARRRchive, give üôÇ  if ARRR-rated.

[03-Jan-20 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
