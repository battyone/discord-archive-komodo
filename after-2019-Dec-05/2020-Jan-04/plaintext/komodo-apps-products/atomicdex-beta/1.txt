whoever is trying to buy KMD with ZEC since days should update his version... `atomicDEX 0.2.7 Android` is old and will not be able to send any ZEC...

[03-Jan-20 12:31 PM] zatJUM#9924
Are there any OUR electrum servers?

[03-Jan-20 12:42 PM] cipi#4502
no, no electrums for OUR... isn#T that project dead anyway?

[03-Jan-20 12:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
That's what I've read, but I just want to provide some liquidity on that coin.

[03-Jan-20 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[03-Jan-20 01:42 PM] fazer#0903
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 an is there any minimum to hodl to be able to claim ?

[03-Jan-20 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
10

[03-Jan-20 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
specifically a UTXO of 10 or greater, not just 10 total

[03-Jan-20 01:50 PM] fazer#0903
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i was trying to claim i have more UTXO size than 10 but no reward claimable.... i was not moving funds whole month, trying every day whole month with same result as "no rewards claimable"

[03-Jan-20 01:55 PM] gcharang#6833
@fazer search your address here: <https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards>
you will see if there are any issues
most issues can be solved by sending the whole balance to yourself using Verus Agama, ocean qt wallet or atomicDEX or any other wallet that supports rewards

[03-Jan-20 01:58 PM] Acura#2748
Any Info when we will see a new AtomicDex Update ? 🙂

[03-Jan-20 02:01 PM] fazer#0903
one thing, that i have multiple income income transactions to same address with UTXO size less than 10... maybe that was a problem

[03-Jan-20 02:01 PM] fazer#0903
@gcharang thank you i will check. maybe that income transactions less than 10 are problem

[03-Jan-20 06:00 PM] ronyi#5719
I tried to swap 1dex to xKMD, but now my DEX wallet contain -1dex with 2 conf, and I my KMD address is still 0. Swap: 2/3 Swap ID: 1169fa05-8530-4401-bccc-9fc9c85f7f9f How this is it possible? Now: timeout. I have -1DEX (with 3 conf)and 0KMD. It was a good swap.

[03-Jan-20 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
if anyone has a moment to spare, please do some RICK/MORTY and MORTY/RICK swaps

[03-Jan-20 06:17 PM] ronyi#5719

[03-Jan-20 07:22 PM] figgy132#7531
@ronyi I have that swap id - it's showing timeout at my end, kmd have left wallet but out for dinner so haven't checked

[03-Jan-20 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
@ronyi can take a look at it if you pm txids/address, not sure I'll be much help other than telling you how it might have happened

[03-Jan-20 07:24 PM] ronyi#5719
KMD still not arrived my wallet

[03-Jan-20 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
@vogelfreund88 you did 7 successful  RICK MORTY swaps just now?

[03-Jan-20 07:29 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
Now it’s getting more difficult

[03-Jan-20 07:29 PM] Alright#0419
did 7 finish?

[03-Jan-20 07:39 PM] figgy132#7531
Actually, my last 2 trades are stuck - what kind of time do I wait before the Unlock Funds button appears?

[03-Jan-20 07:39 PM] ronyi#5719
4hours

👌

[03-Jan-20 07:42 PM] figgy132#7531
The last time this happened to me was when ZEC updated. Once I'd updated the AtomicDex app, clicking the Unlock Funds button gave me the ZEC I had bought :)

[03-Jan-20 07:48 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
@Alright yes

[03-Jan-20 07:49 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
Now it’s 1/8

[03-Jan-20 08:30 PM] zatJUM#9924
Are success swaps filtered like this?```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"my_recent_swaps\"}" | jq -c '.result | .swaps | .[] | select(.success_events[8]=="Finished")'```

[03-Jan-20 08:34 PM] cipi#4502
`success_events` and `error_events` are just a list of all possible success/error event types that are possible

[03-Jan-20 08:34 PM] cipi#4502
not the ones that actually occured in the swap

[03-Jan-20 08:35 PM] zatJUM#9924
So how do I filter finished swaps?

[03-Jan-20 08:40 PM] cipi#4502
finished =! successfull
you need to check if one of the events of the swap is of type `error_events`, if so the swap failed

[03-Jan-20 08:41 PM] zatJUM#9924
Thank you cipi 👌

[03-Jan-20 08:45 PM] cipi#4502
```
my $json = decode_json(read_file($ARGV[0]));
my $events = $json->{'events'};
my $error_events = $json->{'error_events'};

LOOP: foreach my $event( @$events ) {
    my $event_type = $event->{'event'}{'type'};
    foreach my $error( @$error_events ) {
        if ( $event_type eq $error ) {
            print "failed swap\n";
            last LOOP;
        }
    }
}
```
i do this in perl... `$ARGV[0]` is the path to swap json-file which contains the same info displayed by `my_recent_swaps`

[03-Jan-20 08:47 PM] cipi#4502
maybe you can do the same with `jq`
my example is also more complicated then it should be, simply because i didn't manage to call something like `if element is in array` in perl 🙂

[03-Jan-20 08:48 PM] zatJUM#9924
Searching... 👍

Been trying to do KMD/AXE and KMD/HUSH swaps the last couple days and they never get past “order matching”. Nothing ever shows in my history either.

[03-Jan-20 08:53 PM] cipi#4502
i saw 2 KMD/AXE tries, both failed at `NegotiateFailed` on maker side with no info from taker
are you using latest version?

[03-Jan-20 08:59 PM] J.J.#3939
Version 0.2.11

[03-Jan-20 09:03 PM] cipi#4502
can you please try again and if it fails share your logs?

Updated this for tracking by amount of previous days if anyone is interested. Any suggestions/requests welcome. Next step is doing many pairs at once

Could just be a glitch too?

[03-Jan-20 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
you're sure it's not a graphical error? Checked an explorer? It's actually gone?

[03-Jan-20 10:48 PM] lost_souls_club#8354
Shiit sorry. You are right the ETH thing just disapeared entirely! I added it again and my ETH is back!
