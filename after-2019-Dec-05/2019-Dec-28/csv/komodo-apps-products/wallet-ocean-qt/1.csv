If I cannot, maybe I will cut it and publish by parts, although I prefer to complete my argument as a whole.","",""

"330616197085397006","David Jackson#9229","27-Dec-19 05:11 AM","Hello! Went to sync my Ocean wallet, and saw there's been a whole recent upgrade to KMD. Hopefully I'm not too late to get a new wallet going...

I'm not all that savvy with computer stuff, so I thought I'd just quickly ask here first before charge ahead and maybe break something: I just downloaded the latest release of the Ocean-qt wallet thing, the 3.0.0 one... have extracted the files... now, do I need to delete everything from the previous Ocean wallet I was using first (apart from the wallet.dat file, of course!), and then run the new wallet files? They would then proceed to download all the blocks and stuff, right?

Or can I just replace those three extracted files over the top of where the old ones were, and then run the wallet?

(BTW, I am using Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS)

Thanks!

if it was in the last week, you have to delete the blockchain data(except wallet.dat) and start the latest version of the wallet
it will sync from scratch
if you are in a hurry, you could use the bootstrap
happy to answer any questions!","",""

I try to sync it once a month, so I opened it yesterday, and it loaded blocks for a while. Then I saw it wasn't opening the wallet like it usually would, so I thought I'd better check Komodo's twitter feed, and then I saw the upgrade or hard fork or whatever it is. Thus I went to download the new one.","",""

backup your wallet.dat
delete blocks/ , chainstate/ , notarisations/, komodostate, komodostate.ind from your data directory
