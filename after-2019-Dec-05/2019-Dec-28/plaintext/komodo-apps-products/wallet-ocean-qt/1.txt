This one takes me a lot of time, so please bear with me. I hope that I will be able to publish it in a day or two.
If I cannot, maybe I will cut it and publish by parts, although I prefer to complete my argument as a whole.

Hello! Went to sync my Ocean wallet, and saw there's been a whole recent upgrade to KMD. Hopefully I'm not too late to get a new wallet going...

I'm not all that savvy with computer stuff, so I thought I'd just quickly ask here first before charge ahead and maybe break something: I just downloaded the latest release of the Ocean-qt wallet thing, the 3.0.0 one... have extracted the files... now, do I need to delete everything from the previous Ocean wallet I was using first (apart from the wallet.dat file, of course!), and then run the new wallet files? They would then proceed to download all the blocks and stuff, right?

Or can I just replace those three extracted files over the top of where the old ones were, and then run the wallet?

(BTW, I am using Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS)

Thanks!
@Decker

@David Jackson when was the last time you have started the wallet?
if it was in the last week, you have to delete the blockchain data(except wallet.dat) and start the latest version of the wallet
it will sync from scratch
if you are in a hurry, you could use the bootstrap
happy to answer any questions!

@gcharang Thanks for the reply! Yeah, I started it in the last week - yesterday. I try to sync it once a month, so I opened it yesterday, and it loaded blocks for a while. Then I saw it wasn't opening the wallet like it usually would, so I thought I'd better check Komodo's twitter feed, and then I saw the upgrade or hard fork or whatever it is. Thus I went to download the new one.

So, I will need to delete all the Komodo folders, then, apart from the wallet.dat file?

[27-Dec-19 05:41 AM] David Jackson#9229
including the .zcashparams one?

[27-Dec-19 05:43 AM] gcharang#6833
don't delete the .zcashparams 
backup your wallet.dat
delete blocks/ , chainstate/ , notarisations/, komodostate, komodostate.ind from your data directory

@gcharang OK, that's not too hard... what about the "database" folder? shall I leave that one? komodo.conf? does that need to be the new one from the latest wallet files download?

[27-Dec-19 05:52 AM] gcharang#6833
every file other than wallet.dat and komodo.conf can be deleted

[27-Dec-19 05:54 AM] David Jackson#9229
Brilliant. Delete the whole .komodo folder, then, or just the contents of it? What about the "KomodoOcean" folder? Keep that, of delete also?

[27-Dec-19 05:57 AM] gcharang#6833
the .komodo folder has wallet.dat and komodo.conf . so, delete all the files/folders in .komodo other than wallet.dat and komodo.conf
"KomodoOcean" folder can be deleted
the newly downloaded files from https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1-9979ca2 are enough for running the latest version
