is it possible on KMD to have related chains (special tx between those hains, e.g. easy atomic swap)

for example there could be 1 normal chain, and the other one that depends on it in a way that initially coins are created by sending coins to special addr from the Chain1 (C1). Thereafter C2 could also create its coins by minting only. This way C1 and C2 would be separate blockchain with quit diff specifics but also interesting relation when C2 is createn auto when C1 is "destroyed" and also C1 is created auto when C2 is destroyed.

I thinking how staking could be incorporated by co-dependend chain to z-tx based chain only 🙂 without corrupting the orig chain anon set with more t-tx

if C1 and C2 were taddr, it would be possible, with one of them zaddr only, that makes it hard to see how it can be done
