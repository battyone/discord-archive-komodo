[telegram] <Acura360> I myself prefer for big amounts a hardware wallet ledger nano or trezor
You can also use Verus Agama.m, otherwhise you can use AtomicDex for this, but you need to make sure you've secured your seed properly

[telegram] <Regnar> I have to recommend not storing any large amount of coins on any mobile device, ever. Please be safe and opt for more security like hardware and paper wallets. AtomicDEX is safe and your keys are only on your device, but you are essentially carrying your keys around with you everywhere, so minimize how many coins you store on your phone. (re @cmyslopez: How stable is this version to storage a big amount of KMD?)

[27-Dec-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Just think of it like a wallet, and hardware as a bank vault. You don't carry all your money in your pocket, just enough to do what you may need it for.
