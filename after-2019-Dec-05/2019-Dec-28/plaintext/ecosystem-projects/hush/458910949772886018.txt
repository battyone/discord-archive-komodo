[dscrd-hush] <Finality> @dukeleto  as i am doing malay translation now. I have one guy from india who said he could do Tamil. Would u be interested in that language too?

[27-Dec-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> Spoken by indian diasporas around the world more than hindi itself. Not an easy language but he has degree in Tamil language. He is very interested to do if given green light

[27-Dec-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Privatoshi thanks man

[27-Dec-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto if all txns are z does this mean no public hushlists?

[27-Dec-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @gigamesh you can still subscribe to a hushlist with your zs address. Basically it doesnt change much for HushList.

[27-Dec-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Finality yes to Tamil translation ðŸ™‚

[27-Dec-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i thought publishing a public list required t txns

[27-Dec-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no

[27-Dec-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "public hushlist" just means you tell the public about it

[27-Dec-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> vs private/secret ones

[27-Dec-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Regnar very good questions about CC's, was waiting for it ðŸ™‚ Current CC's are not compat with z2z, but zatomicDEX will likely use some type of new zCC. So old CC's won't work, but there will be new zCC's to power zatomicDEX, most likely

[27-Dec-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> @dukeleto we will get in to it right away

[27-Dec-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> telling the public about it is the point tho, right?

[27-Dec-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh not in all use cases

[27-Dec-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> private mailing lists, people want them

[27-Dec-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> maybe you want to have a HushList for friends only @gigamesh

[27-Dec-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Finality> @dukeleto trying to call u duke

[27-Dec-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The few things that I wrote about in the original Hushlist paper that require taddrs can now be implemented with zaddr viewkeys and other ways. Basically you can do everything you want without taddrs

[27-Dec-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> dont forget to translate sdl @Finality ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ˜Ž

[27-Dec-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> Sure

[27-Dec-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If there is really something you want to experiment with that requires taddrs, you can do it on a Hush Smart Chain. Some people rightly do not ever want their private data on a public blockchain, so our tools can cater to those people to

[27-Dec-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> Oh god u think i am inflitrating?

[27-Dec-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can spin up a z2z Hush Smart Chain on a VPN with only others that you trust/etc

[27-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ok i think i get it, but technically a public hushlist where ppl can subscribe to a mailing list by gathering info from the chain would no longer be possible? (assuming thats how the original paper intended the functionality)

[27-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't do phone calls with people I don't know personally, please do not ask.

[27-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> smart chains, nice!

[27-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> If you publish your zs address its still possible

[27-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @gigamesh

[27-Dec-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh good question. The original paper assumed that people find out about hushlists via other people in emails, chats, website links, etc

[27-Dec-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There would be no easy way to tell just from an explorer or blockchain data, that a certain address is a hushlist

[27-Dec-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There would be no way at all

[27-Dec-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is the point ðŸ™‚

[27-Dec-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So going z2z doesn't really affect how 99.9% of people will use stuff

[27-Dec-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and now with zaddr sapling viewkeys, we can implement stuff without sending to a taddr

[27-Dec-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the original hushlists paper had a use case about doing a z=>t, and tying that together with proof that you own that taddr

[27-Dec-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we don do similar things now, avoiding the z=>t

[27-Dec-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @thanks mate, how are you?)

[27-Dec-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `we can do similar things now, avoiding the z=>t` is what I meant

[27-Dec-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> thx duke that's interesting, i had thought that the hush explorer would have an API allowing info about "public hushlists" to be indexed by human readable names. the handing over of a viewkey seems like an extra step to creating a similar, but subtly different tech

[27-Dec-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh no human readable names, hushlists are known by their zaddr or viewkey

[27-Dec-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Human readable names are metadata to be tracked and tie you to other addresses. That is for Verus and stuff, we think that is a bug not a feature

[27-Dec-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh sending to a hushlist only requires knowing a zaddr

[27-Dec-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the 3rd party  scraping the explorer would have created a list of human readable names attached to known addresses. in any case ill re-read the original z>t use case

[27-Dec-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the original use cases which required doing a z=>t can be done in other ways now, is the TLDR. Viewing keys allow for many amazing things

[27-Dec-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Viewing keys are what will power zatomicDEX

[27-Dec-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> without them, it's not possible

[27-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you are right that a chain analysis company could scrape the public web for public hushlist data and give human readable names/tags to stuff such as "exchange", "pool", "CEXshit.com", etc...

[27-Dec-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is why private Hush smartchains are important, that have no public metadata anywhere on the public internet

[27-Dec-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tip.cc> :HUSH: @dukeleto sent @Regnar **25.00 HUSH** (â‰ˆ $1.24).
