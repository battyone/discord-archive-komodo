BREAKING: Sweden just announced the launch of the "e-krona", it's own central bank digital currency in a new pilot platform.

Digital currencies are the space race of our generation.

However, my bet is on Bitcoin getting to the moon first.

hmm ... someone is in a really foul mood   üêª it seems... _where are all the honey-dipped üçØ  javascript blockchains you promised?!?! ... WHERE?!?!_

slow and steady wins the race- with light baggage, and a lot of mileage, that is the Kmodo way. 
I much prefer this to haystack fires (which most crypto projects are) that start with lofty claims,  high expectations, and a hellish burn rate to match üî• 
.. so then the attrition starts bcs project members are getting really cold feet üêü  - and LISK HQ tries to hush it up by deleting posts:

Lisk Central America was one of the delegates to leave this week.
The following post was deleted from there subreddit.
Our faith in HQ to deliver a product has been diminishing for sometime but as of late we have lost all confidence in HQ.
With management making mistake after mistake with no sign of learning, it is time for us to step down as a delegate and organization.
We hope all community members the best of luck. It has been a wild ride but it is time to get off .
Maybe one day we will see a full product from Lisk but that is still years away.
The space is moving too fast and our opinion is Lisk will be left before it even has a chance to release a full SDK.
We are still bullish on crypto and blockchain in general but this project lacks the right leadership and experience to succeed in our opinion. Too many early missteps have taken place , that has now left the project in a bad place with the current layoffs.
Management never seemed to address serious concerns and opinions over the years from both employees and community members. This resulting in many talented employees and community members leaving Lisk behind.
It‚Äôs a Sad day as we had high hopes for Lisk and it‚Äôs sidechain technology but it‚Äôs apparent that this team can not deliverer. We hope that other talented projects continue and bring this technology to life.
I hope all those talented employees that were recently fired right before Christmas all are successful in their job searches.
Good luck to Lisk and the community!
If you have any questions you can PM us here.

wait, are you saying LISK never delivered on their sidechains?

[14-Dec-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
they raised a lot of BTC

[14-Dec-19 03:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
15k BTC

[14-Dec-19 03:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I hope the ‚Äúmoar marketing‚Äù crowd takes note of all these marketing based coins biting the dust

But then again: they don't have anything tangible to market

[14-Dec-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yet they are speding 250k/mo on marketing (at least according to that thread)

[14-Dec-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it is true they converted half their remaining BTC at $3500 and only have 3000 or BTC left, it is quite amazing how fast they went through all their funds

[14-Dec-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
we started with 2600 and are down to 1600 or so, with 200 worth in a hedge

[14-Dec-19 04:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
With a substantial chunk being used for DPoW , 160ish if I remember right .

[14-Dec-19 04:32 PM] sœÜldat#8733
12k BTC in marketing ?? really?

[14-Dec-19 04:33 PM] joe2x4#5987
This is good opportunity to bring in LISK folks to Komodo family. Has anyone reached out to those who are disillusioned?

[14-Dec-19 04:35 PM] sœÜldat#8733
I don't think it's an opportunity, but it's just a matter of time. so that people can open their eyes to the real projects (who build and manage their budgets)

[14-Dec-19 04:38 PM] joe2x4#5987
"talented employees" "job search"

[14-Dec-19 04:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I understand that,  however assuming they cut from the fat and not the meat I would imagine the majority of those let go are of the marketing persuasion.

[14-Dec-19 04:59 PM] joe2x4#5987
This is for those fired from LISK
