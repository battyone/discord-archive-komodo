our funds are almost all in BTC

[14-Dec-19 08:09 AM] coingirl87#6489
Equity

[14-Dec-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
equity? what are you asking about

[14-Dec-19 08:11 AM] coingirl87#6489
For example supernet has more than 10% of all kmd

[14-Dec-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, supernet is different project, now it is mostly a long term holding fund

[14-Dec-19 08:12 AM] coingirl87#6489
If you had sell some of them at high kmd now has more fund in btc to be more competitive

[14-Dec-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
true, i did miss out on that. i was incompetent

[14-Dec-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt follow my own advice

[14-Dec-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577
It's easy to make decisions in past when you see the graph 😅

[14-Dec-19 08:13 AM] coingirl87#6489
I only say what jll says

[14-Dec-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
my only excuse was that i was coding 18hrs per day 7 days a week and didnt pay enough attention to price

[14-Dec-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but this does not affect KMD, only supernet

[14-Dec-19 08:14 AM] coingirl87#6489
He says "then again, that would have prevented cashing out 10% when the price was over 100k sats"

[14-Dec-19 08:15 AM] coingirl87#6489
I dont say that you have to do that...but kmd has no person who can handle this?

[14-Dec-19 08:15 AM] coingirl87#6489
This is not a one man show

[14-Dec-19 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
There was possibility to buy stablecoins when BTC was at 20k then buyback at 3k

[14-Dec-19 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
If to count all the retrospective

[14-Dec-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
kmd doesnt manage supernet

[14-Dec-19 08:15 AM] coingirl87#6489
Why not? Supernet is part of it

[14-Dec-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
you are incorrect

[14-Dec-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
supernet was years before KMD

[14-Dec-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
how can something be part of something that doesnt exist

[14-Dec-19 08:16 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok then kmd is part of supernet

[14-Dec-19 08:16 AM] coingirl87#6489
Supernet is the mother

[14-Dec-19 08:17 AM] coingirl87#6489
So why not mother helps her childs?

[14-Dec-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
supernet does help KMD

[14-Dec-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but selling KMD was not part of the ways supernet helped KMD

[14-Dec-19 08:18 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok ok...thats pitty

{Reactions}
🤔

[14-Dec-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
next time kmd price is very high, remind me to sell some

[14-Dec-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody did that during the last altseason

[14-Dec-19 08:19 AM] coingirl87#6489
It could bring more funds to kmd...more funds means more projects...more projechts means more demand and growing volume and price...

[14-Dec-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, dont forget to remind me then

[14-Dec-19 08:20 AM] coingirl87#6489
But yes you are right....nobody knows it at last alt bull run

[14-Dec-19 08:20 AM] coingirl87#6489
Me also...only sell 5%...not more

[14-Dec-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i am complaining that you didnt remind me to sell during the last altseason

[14-Dec-19 08:21 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats good....i will learn from it andcwill remind you next time...but the question is...is that a option for you to sell kmd from supernet to have more funds for kmd?

[14-Dec-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is an option

[14-Dec-19 08:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
Is that okey for all supernet holders?

[14-Dec-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
especially with atomicDEX

[14-Dec-19 08:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
So there will be a poll?

[14-Dec-19 08:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
For all holders?

[14-Dec-19 08:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
That would be cool...democracy

[14-Dec-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is within my charter to maximize ROI by doing occasional portfolio rebalancing

[14-Dec-19 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
hmm, democracy in investment/trading desicions is a financial suicide usually

[14-Dec-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the timing cant be broadcast by some public vote

[14-Dec-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
for obvious reasons

[14-Dec-19 08:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes but you could a poll early...before the next altcoin bull run

[14-Dec-19 08:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
And ask holders if in case kmd will increase its okey to sell kmd from fund

[14-Dec-19 08:25 AM] TonyL#3577
You'll poll on each prices/dominance ratio combination and each graph pattern?

[14-Dec-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont expect anybody to be against this, let alone anything like 51% against

[14-Dec-19 08:26 AM] coingirl87#6489
But hey...i dont know if its feasible or efficient on investor view

[14-Dec-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if there are any significant investors that objects to profit taking during next altseason, they can let me know and if there is say 10%+ of the stake represented, we can do a poll for it

[14-Dec-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if 10% cant come out against it, then no poll would be 51% against

[14-Dec-19 08:27 AM] coingirl87#6489
Okey so its my task to remind you at next bull run and all is fine 😅

🤑

[14-Dec-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[14-Dec-19 08:28 AM] SHossain#0007
I give full vote of my SUPERNET stack for jl777 to manage the portfolio as he likes. He has the ability and expertise to do better and always liked how he does things

[14-Dec-19 08:29 AM] SHossain#0007
Most of the investors during SUPERNET ICO participated on what jl777 said and expressed his vision

[14-Dec-19 08:29 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok thats a deal

[14-Dec-19 08:29 AM] TonyL#3577
hmm would be interesting to make some index fund software on base of pricesCC + pegs maybe

[14-Dec-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the crypto market is not as it used to be. there is no way to replicate the results i have had

[14-Dec-19 08:29 AM] TonyL#3577
something similar to ICONOMI but better because we have priceCC

[14-Dec-19 08:29 AM] SHossain#0007
I just regret for not being able to invest more that time

[14-Dec-19 08:30 AM] SHossain#0007
didn't have enough funds to invest more as 2014 is the year when i got into crypto

[14-Dec-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
so fund managers will able to compete, attact investments for their portfolios and etc

[14-Dec-19 08:31 AM] artik123#2884

@artik123 you can use binance api to get historical trades from a specific date

[14-Dec-19 12:56 PM] richardt#2807
@coingirl87 I agree it does suck prices are so low now. However, on the bright side, it's becoming more likely that this is the bottom. Which means if you're able accumulate more now, you stand to make a huge profit when the alt market turns around

[14-Dec-19 12:57 PM] richardt#2807
Not saying you should buy more, just another way to think about it

[14-Dec-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
I think its impossible to know what will happen, this might not even be close to the bottom

[14-Dec-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
if btc pumps up to 10k tomorrow  i can guarantee u that kmd will be back at 6k sats in matter of minutes

[14-Dec-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
and it can happen we have seen that before

[14-Dec-19 01:44 PM] richardt#2807
In terms of USD, it's likely the bottom or very close

[14-Dec-19 01:45 PM] richardt#2807
In satoshi, anything could happen. I agree

[14-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
8,3k seem to be significant resistance

[14-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
4 attempts to break through

[14-Dec-19 02:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hate it when dipshits would sacrifice the projects longevity for their own personal fiat gains

[14-Dec-19 04:39 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Wow jl to take trading advice from coingirl... facepalm. Imo any company taking trading advice from investors is taking a step in a bad direction

[14-Dec-19 04:56 PM] artik123#2884
@TonyL do you know why I can't find iconomi on cmc?

[14-Dec-19 04:59 PM] Acura#2748
There was a migration of the Iconomi funds , long time ago - maybe the Project is dead ?

[14-Dec-19 05:00 PM] artik123#2884
It is looks like their website is still running...

[14-Dec-19 05:04 PM] artik123#2884
40 employees on linkedin and they still posting articles

[14-Dec-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
@Bitfinger i only want to make sure someone reminds me to assess some profit taking, next time we get to ATH. last time around, i was too deep into coding and the ATH spike was very brief

[14-Dec-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, it is just a matter for supernet

[14-Dec-19 05:27 PM] Bitfinger#6245
@jl777c understood 👌

Most crypto currencies are at or near Bollinger Band Squeeze levels. Time to pay attention.

$HEX is down 99.93% in 12 days.

Since the invention of the spoon...

[14-Dec-19 10:18 PM] richardt#2807
Let's not make fun of other projects too much. KMD was suppose to be top 5 a year ago!

[14-Dec-19 10:20 PM] richardt#2807
But I guess as jl777 said, we should count our blessings we're not buried on the 3rd or 4th page of CMC
