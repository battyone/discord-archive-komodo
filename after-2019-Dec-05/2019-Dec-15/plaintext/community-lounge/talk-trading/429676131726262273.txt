@Markus how did you extract this info from binance?

[14-Dec-19 02:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
There is a page which sells trading data for all the big exchanges on almost all pairs

[14-Dec-19 02:39 AM] artik123#2884
Ok thanks üëç

[14-Dec-19 02:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
Cryptoticks.io i think

[14-Dec-19 02:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
Sorry cryptotick.com
Min order 100 usd for the first time after that 10 usd

[14-Dec-19 02:49 AM] artik123#2884
Yea, I see it thanks... nice

daily OBV chart on binance shows a significant accumulation in the last month

[14-Dec-19 06:05 AM] designer#4893
It's not just komodo, it looks like almost all the alts have been accumulated.

[14-Dec-19 06:06 AM] designer#4893
other alts are rising in price as soon as they accumulate.
komodo is accumulating and prices are dropping.

[14-Dec-19 06:42 AM] artik123#2884
Only about 1/5 of the top 100 coins on cmc from early 2017 survived there, so if you take into account the Lindy effect perspective, komodo situation actually looks quite good

[14-Dec-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt realize the attrition rate was 80%, but considering all these new project i never heard of, it does make sense

[14-Dec-19 07:01 AM] artik123#2884
Almost all coins below #36 were pushed to nowhere land...

Some times sgo there was a kmd pump to 13k and you all  where very euphoric...i told you dont be so euohoric... jl777 also says...this is no pump...this was attention from china...

i became very hostile and insulted for my opinion...but now it seems i was right...

[14-Dec-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the china effect was very real, but within weeks, it reversed.

[14-Dec-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
after the president announcement, things went a bit crazy and then they started to stop many exchanges, which reversed the strong up move. you can see this with the other crypto that went up during the same time

[14-Dec-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
also the OBV shows that a lot of KMD was accumulated and not sold, even as of now

[14-Dec-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that means the price went up on high volumes, but down on low volumes

[14-Dec-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
notice the binance volume is down to 10 BTC, that is because there is hardly anybody selling at this price

[14-Dec-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
when it goes up, the volumes goes up by 10x or more

[14-Dec-19 07:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
At the moment there is absolutly no volume on important exchanges...bilaxy and coinbene doesnt count to me...everybody knows that is fake volume. So what is the plan in future to have stable growing demand and volume? When kmd will have usecases or partners like tezos for example? Are there any plans to be active??

[14-Dec-19 07:28 AM] designer#4893
none of the influential people in the crypto-world ever mentioned komodo's innovation. 
this is true.

so you are expecting kmd to do the same things tezos did, when they raised literally 100x the funding that we did?

@coingirl87 Tesoz has more funds than all top 10 coins combined... komodo started almost from scratch... it's a lot more impresive imo

[14-Dec-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
$228 million

[14-Dec-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
we raised about $2 mil and trading at 30x of what we raised. granted it has taken a bit longer, but please you need to be rational when comparing projects

[14-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
compare us with other projects that did ICO around the same time, i think IOTA is the only one that has outperformed. most of the top50 are new projects with well funded companies, or long time cryptos that predate KMD. what i think is very strong is that KMD has overtaken a lot of the other projects that are older than it is.

[14-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to always be in the 40 to 70 rank, in spite of thousands of new projects

[14-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
some of the old top 20 are barely in the top 500 now

[14-Dec-19 07:34 AM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd raised about 2 miliopn of new investors...bitcoin dark holders get kmd for free...so its theoretical more than 2 millions... eth fund was also not very high....and look where they are now ...but this is not the point

[14-Dec-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the BTCD that was converted was burned, not sure how you can think that helps the project funding in any way

[14-Dec-19 07:36 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...how high was fund for btcd?

[14-Dec-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
we did not sell any of the BTCD, it was all burned

[14-Dec-19 07:36 AM] designer#4893
Cosmos is not a big fundraiser either. But it leads the market.

[14-Dec-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
what does it matter about the BTCD value

maybe to you the difference between 2 and 17 isnt significant... but in reality it is, especially when we need to reserve most of our funds for notarizations

[14-Dec-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC dominance is at 67%+, that is really the most reason why the altcoin prices, including komodo is low

[14-Dec-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
ALL of the crypto that is not in the top 10 are dividing up the remaining 10%

[14-Dec-19 07:39 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok understand...we have not much fund...so what is the plan for future demand to kmd? Are there any ongoing/planed partnership?

[14-Dec-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you believe having a partnership is some magic solution?

[14-Dec-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
we are working with projects that are building on our tech

[14-Dec-19 07:40 AM] coingirl87#6489
Partnership means usecase

[14-Dec-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
ultimately, projects that are used is what is needed

[14-Dec-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
from what i have seen most "partnerships" in crypto are of the press release type

[14-Dec-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
hype without much (if any) substance

[14-Dec-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
we are completing the training materials for devs to more rapidly assimilate the komodo tech

[14-Dec-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and also to work with companies that will help it get adopted

[14-Dec-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if the komodo price was 10x higher than it is now, you wouldnt be complaining, right?

Tezos planned big partnerships with france mility, with brazil bank and african companie

[14-Dec-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so you are complaining about the price being low and not about what the project has accomplished

[14-Dec-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i am glad for tezos

[14-Dec-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but tezos is already valued at above a billion, in this market, 16x what komodo is

[14-Dec-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
of course they will be able to plan more and bigger partnerships than we can, especially with all their funding

[14-Dec-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what your point is?

[14-Dec-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
we are not as good as tezos at doing partnerships?

[14-Dec-19 07:47 AM] Acura#2748
Coingirl always complaining, its boring

[14-Dec-19 07:47 AM] coingirl87#6489
I am not complaining. I am very concerned about stability of kmd....u know that was also a fan of you, your visions and the tech kmd delivers...but this is only one side of medal...other side is demand for kmd...and the demand for kmd was never very high...sometimes there was some punctually pumps but there is no growing demand

[14-Dec-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
with BTC dominance at these levels 10% of crypto marketcap is divided by all the other projects

[14-Dec-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the stablecoin EURK will create a demand to lock the KMD

[14-Dec-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
when atomicDEX scales, that will also create demand

[14-Dec-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
as we get new projects building on komodo, that will also create demand

[14-Dec-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but all this takes time, and as long as we are making progress, then we are making progress.

[14-Dec-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
what the price does is mostly controlled by BTC price and BTC dominance

[14-Dec-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so i think it is best to ignore it and just keep developing. that is what to do during altcoin winter

[14-Dec-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and then when altseason comes, without changing anything, the price goes up 10x

[14-Dec-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and if the price was 10x, you wouldnt be complaining, would you?

[14-Dec-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so just make sure komodo is continuing to improve things and wait for altseason. if altseason comes and komodo doesnt participate in it, then please complain

[14-Dec-19 07:53 AM] coingirl87#6489
We will see...thanks for taking time to answer my "complains"

[14-Dec-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
we have done things like travala.com, that is a partnership and allows you to pay for hotels with KMD. not sure if that matches your idea of partnership, but it does make KMD that much more useful

[14-Dec-19 07:54 AM] artik123#2884

how much ETH did they raise?

[14-Dec-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe they are trading at 2x book value.

[14-Dec-19 07:56 AM] TonyL#3577
If you taking 2 millions and making 70mil marketcap thats 3500% ROI, if you taking 1/4 of billion and making 1bill marketcap thats 400% ROI

[14-Dec-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is actually trading at 6x book value

[14-Dec-19 07:56 AM] artik123#2884
65,627 BTC and 361,122 ETH

[14-Dec-19 07:57 AM] coingirl87#6489
In usd

[14-Dec-19 07:57 AM] coingirl87#6489
Not btc

[14-Dec-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know what book value is?

[14-Dec-19 07:58 AM] coingirl87#6489
Tell me

[14-Dec-19 07:59 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ico price was around 10k -12k satoshi and 10 eurocent

[14-Dec-19 07:59 AM] coingirl87#6489
So in usd or eur we have an roi but in btc there is a loss

[14-Dec-19 08:00 AM] coingirl87#6489
If i am a stupid investor i am happy about plus in usd but i am a good investor i am not happy about loss in btc

[14-Dec-19 08:01 AM] coingirl87#6489
So its a point of view

[14-Dec-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
agreed

[14-Dec-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
better to have just hold onto BTC all this time

[14-Dec-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
then again, that would have prevented cashing out 10% when the price was over 100k sats

[14-Dec-19 08:02 AM] TonyL#3577
btc price was 700$, now it's 7k$ - quite hard to outperform it

[14-Dec-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
that would have returned all the ICO investment

[14-Dec-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
my rule for ICO investment is to always pull out what i put into it as soon as it is possible. and for those that followed the same rule, KMD has been just fine. of course we want it to go back above 100k sats, but for that to happen BTC dominance needs to get back to 40%

[14-Dec-19 08:05 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok i agreed to your rule...i was good enough to sell 5% of portfolio in january 2018

[14-Dec-19 08:05 AM] coingirl87#6489
But what is with kmd fund? You also sell kmd on high to have a more value?

[14-Dec-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that is from rewards, so you recouped the BTC and still have all the KMD

[14-Dec-19 08:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, it was possible to fix profit in BTC during the whole 2018

[14-Dec-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont trade with the BTC raised

[14-Dec-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
we do hedge some against BTC price falling

[14-Dec-19 08:07 AM] designer#4893
