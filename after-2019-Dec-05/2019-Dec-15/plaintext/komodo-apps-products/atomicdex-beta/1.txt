if it is good enough for Gilfoyle it should be OK for us.  Not annoying is it?

To be more serious  I like the stopwatch idea @Gordon Komodo  suggested.

Is the atomic dex as a wallet as safe as any other wallet? Or is it more vulnerable b/c its a wallet on a mobile device?

[14-Dec-19 02:09 PM] gcharang#6833
it should be as "safe" as a mobile wallet can be
safety in general:
always offline device > hardware wallets > desktop native ~ mobile > web browser

ofc, there are always caveats and one person's opsec can make their mobile wallet safer than someone else's hardware wallet

Hi, I made a few exchanges on the AtomicDEX and have quite a bit of BTC leftover. I keep trying to withdraw from the app and it keeps saying "Error, please try again later". Is there a fix for this? I keep trying and nothing is working. Thanks.
