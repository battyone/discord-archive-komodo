@CoinKing88 does refreshing the browser window make the error go away?

[22-Dec-19 08:25 AM] gcharang#6833
@Razzler04 if you are only using Komodo in native mode with Ocean wallet qt, the current latest release at https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases works

Yeah error is solved, don't really know why i got it. Refreshing did not help, maybe it was too short after update?

[22-Dec-19 11:54 AM] gcharang#6833
it could be
or a more likely problem is that the server received too many requests at that time and wasn't able to handle yours

I keep getting spam DM for free BTC etc. The only discord server i use is KMD so he must be getting my Userid from in here. Any way to deal with this?

Yesterday i received a similar message but from another ID, all ready deleted that one

It's not that they are pretending to be part of KMD team but its very annoying.

Hello, I know trezor now support KMD storage, but the trezor website does not mention whether or not claiming is also supported as well. Neither does the KMD website. Can someone please bring me up to speed on this?
