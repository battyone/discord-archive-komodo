ahhhh

[22-Dec-19 05:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that site is wrong about many things

[22-Dec-19 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm guessing they are calling some of the NN blocks "PoS" 🤷🏽‍♂️

[22-Dec-19 05:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that would be 78.9% of the last 1000 blocks

[22-Dec-19 05:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Over the last 1000 blocks...
Miners got: 211 blocks and NNs got 789 blocks`

Morning fellas

[22-Dec-19 06:55 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what do you guys think of digibyte?

[22-Dec-19 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's still a thing? 🤔

[22-Dec-19 07:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
its rank is still higher than Komodo.
personnaly I don't reallly like their approach to scalability.

[22-Dec-19 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've heard so little about them in recent times, I kinda forgot about it

[22-Dec-19 07:23 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what about ravencoin?

[22-Dec-19 07:23 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
or iota?

[22-Dec-19 07:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I don't know much about ravencoin.
I haven't followed IOTA news recently, still waiting until they successfully remove the Coordinator

[22-Dec-19 07:32 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i didnt even know they were trying to remove the coordinator

[22-Dec-19 07:33 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i thought it was going to be a permanent central fixture

[22-Dec-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be after ETH goes to PoS

> i didnt even know they were trying to remove the coordinator
They announced the project to gradually remove it last year or so, I don't clearly remember exactly when <https://coordicide.iota.org/>

why the hell does ethereum classic still exist

[22-Dec-19 08:34 PM] richardt#2807
The ironic thing is that other people from other projects speak the same way about KMD 😄

[22-Dec-19 08:34 PM] richardt#2807
Or worse, they don't speak about KMD at all

[22-Dec-19 08:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Sorry @VoskCoin missed your messages. For the next election so everyone is clear, you will stand as notary and will make promotional/videos about KMD ONLY if you make enough net profit to warrant your precious time to look into KMD?

:troll_hardcore:

[22-Dec-19 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why the hell does ethereum classic still exist`
Because some folks are still morally opposed to rolling back a chain because some random private party that had nothing to do with the chain itself didn't secure their server?

[22-Dec-19 09:17 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
fair

[22-Dec-19 09:17 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
it's not really a viable chain anymore though

[22-Dec-19 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You'd be amazed at the number of chains that still move and trade and haven't been useful in years

Hello everybody, does anyone know alias "Aamodt"? Supposedly he/she should be developer for Komodo.

[22-Dec-19 11:24 PM] PTYX#6840
@androkles did he PM you or something?
