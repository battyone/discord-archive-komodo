@phm87 Can you please explain what you ultimately did to get past that error "error: some components unavailable for download channel nightly-2019-10-06: 'clippy', 'rustfmt'" etc? I'm getting the same exact error. Using Ubuntu 18.04 and following that guide.

[22-Dec-19 09:12 AM] phm87#7395
Yes. I hope that kmd team will update docs for ubuntu this time.
I am using ubuntu 16.04
I had to reinstall cmake that was not properly installed. Cmake was not in path

I remember that I had to use tricks for rust

[22-Dec-19 09:14 AM] phm87#7395
I installed mm2 on 2 VM but I encountered the same errors twice. I will send you my notes and I will try to install it on a 3rd VM (I need to do it for one of my projects)

[22-Dec-19 09:18 AM] tolken#2655
haven't even gotten to building, still at rust install üòÑ but thank you for the notes, good to know. Just trying to finally get back into this, have some time on my hands again so looking forward to trying to provide some additional liquidity. Was all setup back in the mm1.0 days, but lots to catch up on. Thanks very much phm87

Do we have a atomic dex api exception documentation? Error handling is a bit difficult with the API... 

How could I ignore the following error:
{"error":"rpc:273] lp_commands:74] lp_coins:452] Coin MORTY already initialized"}

 I would have to search the text for "already initialized" or?

[22-Dec-19 12:22 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
And what does "]" stand for?

[22-Dec-19 12:22 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
Thanks! üôÇ

[22-Dec-19 12:22 PM] Oszy#5734
try asking in #dev-marketmaker

[22-Dec-19 12:23 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
ok i try thanks

[22-Dec-19 12:30 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
] follows stack trace information (allowing you to readily find the relevant source code). We have plans to introduce maintainable error codes. As of now you'd use `ends_with("] Coin MORTY already initialized")`

[22-Dec-19 12:36 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Not sure if this particular error should be handled, can you avoid duplicated initializations instead?

[22-Dec-19 05:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
introducing  a new/private  coin  should be easy  in  the future  with  atomic DEX -- especially  with nSPV  around the  corner  for KMD asset  chains,

[22-Dec-19 05:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
just import  a basic coin  file  and you  are  done

[22-Dec-19 05:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
/parameters and  icon

[22-Dec-19 05:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so  farmer  joe will  be  able to BARTER  DEX  his pigs on  the blockchain

Hello Admin, 
How can I see my 5.1% rewards on AtomicDEX?

[22-Dec-19 05:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
There is a button to claim them if you hold KMD in the app

[22-Dec-19 05:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'll just  guess  Antara and  AtomicDEX will  be turn key within 12 months VIA nSPV at  a lower cost  for  smaller projects like ToiletMOD or Commode or  Komodore  --- WTF??? --

[22-Dec-19 05:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
the  integration of  Z transactions with  AtomicDEX is when this ship starts sailing.

[22-Dec-19 05:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
1Q  2020

[22-Dec-19 05:41 PM] CoinKing88#1540
How is integrating Z transactions important? Can you explain to a average joe (me)?

[22-Dec-19 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
just allows for ARRR swaps

[22-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
ARRR can then act as sort of a tumbler for any coin it can swap with

[22-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
`1Q  2020` where are you seeing this? @kmdkrazy

[22-Dec-19 05:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[22-Dec-19 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
you mean this one? https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/449950331577565194/647979409122525197

[22-Dec-19 05:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
All the tools are ready to be placed ...the arrr light wallet is ready

[22-Dec-19 05:59 PM] SHossain#0007
arrr lite wallet is already working

[22-Dec-19 05:59 PM] SHossain#0007
in a way

[22-Dec-19 06:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch can provide more info on that

[22-Dec-19 06:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It can blend into DEX soon

[22-Dec-19 06:00 PM] SHossain#0007
but, integrating ARRR on atomicDEX is something that is something for q1 2020. there is a nice bounty for that as well

[22-Dec-19 06:35 PM] CoinKing88#1540
You mean booty? Pirate booty üòÑ

[22-Dec-19 06:48 PM] alcadi#7378
Hi @CoinKing88
Yes, but how long after I deposit can I claim. Because when I try to claim, I get the message "please trying again in 1h"

[22-Dec-19 06:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Just try again in 1h then, 5.1% is annual reward, which you wanna claim monthly to stay active.

[22-Dec-19 06:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes there is a 150k ARRR bounty (so far) for Atomic DEX integration

[22-Dec-19 06:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
How can i claim some of that booty?

[22-Dec-19 06:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm in the process of documenting lightwalletd which should make things a bit clearer however there is still a lot of work to be done for the actual integration

[22-Dec-19 06:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
@CoinKing88 if you know either rustlang (AtomicDEX API) or C++ (core) start coding :]

[22-Dec-19 07:09 PM] alcadi#7378
@CoinKing88, I've been trying for 8 days and it's not working, what am I doing wrong?

[22-Dec-19 07:10 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Well my expertise is limited, ill let a other user answer that one. Should not take 8 days, i claimed daily a few times in a row.

[22-Dec-19 07:10 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@alcadi  what wallet are you using

[22-Dec-19 07:11 PM] alcadi#7378
AtomicDEX

[22-Dec-19 07:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@alcadi  how much kmd do you have in your address?

[22-Dec-19 07:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Minimum to generate reward is 10 KMD in a utxo .

[22-Dec-19 07:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
So if you sent 4 transactions, 3 + 3 +3+1 ,  that would not generate reward.  But if it is all in one utxo as 10, it will .  Easiest way to make sure is just to send your balance to yourself

[22-Dec-19 07:17 PM] alcadi#7378
@polycryptoblog, I'm doing a test with 11 kmd initially

[22-Dec-19 07:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok,  try sending your balance to yourself and try claiming in one hour, though with a small amount like that it may not be enough to overcome txfee. May want to wait on claiming for a bit

[22-Dec-19 07:21 PM] alcadi#7378
Ok, friend I'm going to try  many thanks

[22-Dec-19 09:02 PM] alcadi#7378
@polycryptoblog Thank you very much for your support. One last question; whenever I make a deposit or claim a reward I will have a new balance, should I do the same procedure so that the new rewards are on the total balance?

[22-Dec-19 09:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Use the etomic approach for integrating z coins is my opinion @mrlynch - @artem.pikulin should be capable of seizing some ARRR booty pretty quickly....I think he's the one that made etomic work..

[22-Dec-19 10:06 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
just  change it to ztomic and away you go!
