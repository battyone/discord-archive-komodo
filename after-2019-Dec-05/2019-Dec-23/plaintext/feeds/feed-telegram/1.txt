[telegram] <NicheInvestor> I got time out on one of my swap does that mean I have lost my funds?. (re @polycryptoblog: They both are legit,  The first has money transmitter licensing and Bittrex has been around for 5 years or so now.)

[22-Dec-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> No,  if the funds have left your wallet during timeout it should be able to be reclaimed in 4-6 hours, a button should appear if it doesn‚Äôt let us know and we can help you reclaim them.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> DEX is an asset by jl777 carried over from NXT before Komodo was around. it collects dexfees and revshare with holders.  Pays out when fees collected amount is 1 million usd approx, it pays out in KMD (re @NicheInvestor: Thanks admin for your response the funds has already returned back to me.

[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> He likes the concept but he hasn't done the research.

[22-Dec-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Also, tbh I wouldn't want any crypto project to associate with him. He has had bad situations in the past.

[22-Dec-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> I think he is money hungry.

[telegram] <Craig> Regarding the stable coin, which I think is a great idea and will add to the ecosystem,
If that architecture works out, could many other coins copy that way of collateralizing the coin, or does Komodo have an inherent advantage there?

KMD will have an inherent advantage for the pegs CC stablecoin as there is a sustainable rewards built in for the msig signing nodes. for most all other coins, this will need to be subsidized somehow
