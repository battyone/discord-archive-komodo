havent staked all dau since I deleted komodostate and restarted with either branch

[22-Dec-19 03:39 AM] daemonfox#6136
reindexing now cuz I see a ton of messages that say the current block height > some block 10+ or more blocks ago

[22-Dec-19 03:39 AM] daemonfox#6136

[22-Dec-19 04:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah   -  I reindexed  yesterday

[22-Dec-19 04:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
didnt take  long

[22-Dec-19 04:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok ---  no  more exposed  wif keys   -- cosolidated  all  utxos then resplit  - but  now TUIstaker  says  0  UTXOs -- guessing  cause  it  dont have my  pubkey  or wallet list  --  where do i  see  my utxos now?

[22-Dec-19 05:51 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@blackjok3r  change (using -pubkey will send ALL staking utxo to -pubkey address/segid) to a different command like stakedadd=

[22-Dec-19 05:51 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
pubkey  shouldnt  be  used for  this  instance

[22-Dec-19 11:26 AM] smk762#7640
use `komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listaddress groupings to see if your split addresses are prestent

[22-Dec-19 11:26 AM] smk762#7640
if not., you need to import the wifs
