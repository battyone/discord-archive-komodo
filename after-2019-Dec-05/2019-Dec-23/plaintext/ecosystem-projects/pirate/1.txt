[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] ok thank you so much my friend

[22-Dec-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> being its depndent on the user, I still stand by one of the lowest levels of security, user is the most vulnberable point in any chain, and the fact its the user you mention, kinda restates the point its inherintly less secure to use currency in a mobiule wallet, but to each their own degree of risk by choice.  I am happy to be wrong, but as long as we say, it depends on the user, and you can pick and use one securely...  I use mobile wallets, I certainly dont store my core storage of currency there....  @Cam [Trivia Challenge!]

[22-Dec-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> but ultimately its freedom of choice, and all imho

[22-Dec-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> We agree more than disagree. I don’t keep my largest bags on mobile. I personally feel comfortable with up to about $1000 on my mobile wallet, and would triple that if I needed to, say, travel to a foreign country for a month and wanted more of an emergency stash but would put it in a multi-sig wallet and take two devices.

[22-Dec-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> cant argue that 🙂

[22-Dec-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> And with all of that, I can’t wait for a Pirate mobile wallet that can do payments quickly and privately using QR codes. I’d still only put spending money on my phone but I would love it. And then emergency money would likely be on Pirate OS once luks is implemented. And my long term ARRR will probably be Pirate OS with backup keys stored in an encrypted sparse image in cloud and on a usb drive in a fire safe inside of a large safe.

[22-Dec-19 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> A mobile wallet using Pirate will ***rock*** and make Monero and Dash no longer relevant.

[22-Dec-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> agreed, it will also help with adoption, as I know most ppl wont even bother without one

[dscrd-prt] <C.Bailey> It would be great if ARRR were on this resource - https://proprivacy.com/ (before it was bestvpn.com).
There is a very good reviewer, Douglas Crawford.  He always talks about privacy and anonymity, always answers in the comments on his articles. I think if someone from the ARRR development team contacts him, he can do a good review on this site.

The idea is that they will bring back privacy. I don't know how it is going to work, but I think they are interested in partnering with existing projects. I remember seeing Energi on their video.I think that is the wrong currency. They should push adaptation of arrr if they really are for privacy... and I think as Bitcoin Pete is an old crypto enthusiast, he might be into that.

[dscrd-prt] <mags755> I sent some ARR to Digital price yesterday but didn't realize there was a komodo upgrade.  are my coins lost?

[22-Dec-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> does the transfer show on the block explorer? (<https://explorer.pirate.black>)

[22-Dec-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> and/or on the exchange?

[22-Dec-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mags755> let me check

[22-Dec-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mags755> I use an old Agama wallet and I dont think it saves the tx id

[22-Dec-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mags755> it's all good...I guess we will see tomorrow if they arrive.  it wasnt a lot

[22-Dec-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> depending on how "old" anything is, it likely will not have done anything because of hardfork(s)

[22-Dec-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> are you sure it even synced?

[22-Dec-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> ---------
See, @Llama, only 5 (and really not even that many) 😉

[22-Dec-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mags755> yes it definitely synced and the coins were sent...my wallet is showing a much lower balance

[22-Dec-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mags755> this version of Agama doesnt show a history of tx sends
