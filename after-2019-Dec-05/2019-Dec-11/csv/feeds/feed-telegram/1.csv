Which ""big"" projects (in terms of market cap or hype) would work better if they were in the Komodo ecosystem?

Or, how would the synthetix project work on Komodo vs Ethereum? 
Or, HEX is probably a pretty terrible project. But if you were Richard Heart, why or why not would you have built it inside Komodo?
