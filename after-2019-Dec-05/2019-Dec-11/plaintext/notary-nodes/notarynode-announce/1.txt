@Notary-Operator Hi to all fellow NN operators except CG.
Seems we're finished moving both Komodo and Iguana to new repo and normal usable branch logic. Iguana repo for NNs now is here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW (use master branch) - it is now same for both main net and 3party:
./m_notary_build is doing fresh pull
./m_notary_KMD is mainnet running, 
./m_notary_3rdparty is for 3p.
Notarizations will go smoothly when enough NN do update.
Please update.
 
Also we have new Komodo repo (announced above), please update if you did not.

If you need help - search for me or @SHossain . We're here to help.
