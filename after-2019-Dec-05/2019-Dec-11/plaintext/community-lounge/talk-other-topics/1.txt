if you are looking for security in your hardware which has open source firmware and no backdoor, get this system which would only run Fedora or Debian etc for now https://raptorcs.com/TALOSII/

not sure if you can compile komodo though. it might work or might not since it's a different architecture. not traditional x86 system.

[10-Dec-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
but, would be nice if komodo can be compiled in there

[10-Dec-19 08:47 PM] SHossain#0007
Forgot to mention the above mentioned processor doesn't come with Intel ME or AMD PSP backdoor/vulnerability
