@Enkh D you can see orders for the coins you have  a balance for right now in atomicDEX
but seeing the whole orderbook is possible and in the expected feature list
in the meantime, you can see the orderbook here with a  15 minute delay

how  about  a sound  that humans can not hear?  only annoying dogs

Maybe an option inside the app to choose from different sounds

I was reading "A fully web-based DEX that runs securely from within any browser." And can i be connected to this DEX by Trezor T ? I wanna make all signs by that secured PK storage.... Is it possible ? Or will it be possible ?

Can sound be playd to null? In same way as text can be printed to null

That way whole sound issue could be gone but would allow it work in background.
