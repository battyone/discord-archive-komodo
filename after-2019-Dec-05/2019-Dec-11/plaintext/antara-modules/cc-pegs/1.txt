Because other txs will get higher priority than zero fee so they will be mined first. Abd we want all txs same priority

[10-Dec-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
no, i mean change the priority so that gateways/pegs tx gets equal priority to normally paid tx

[10-Dec-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
does that make sense? we need to make it so doing the gateways/pegs/oracles tx are zerofee, but at the same priority in the miner

`if (tx.IsCoinImport())
            {
                CAmount nValueIn = GetCoinImportValue(tx); // burn amount
                nTotalIn += nValueIn;
                dPriority += (double)nValueIn * 1000;  // flat multiplier... max = 1e16.` 
Does that work for that?

I think we messed with this a lot and found the flat multiplier to be fine

[10-Dec-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only had issues when the value sent was very small and the mempol very large

[10-Dec-19 11:30 AM] Mihailo#5902
I think something like that will do the trick

[10-Dec-19 11:30 AM] Mihailo#5902
Then ok. I'll try it out
