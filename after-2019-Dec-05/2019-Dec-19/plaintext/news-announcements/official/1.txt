@everyone 

A friendly reminder that Komodo's mandatory Obsidian Dragon upgrade to the code base version 0.5.0 will happen at block height 1670000. That's about 57 hours from now. **This is a mandatory platform upgrade, so all miners, exchanges, and individuals running full-seed nodes must update to the latest software before block 1670000. Those who do not update will not run on the correct network.**

As a precaution, we have also advised all services and Exchanges to pause the deposits and withdrawals from Dec. 19th - 21st, 2019.
