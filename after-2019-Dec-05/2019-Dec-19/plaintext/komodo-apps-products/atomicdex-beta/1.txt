Any idea why Atomic Dex won't open on Google Pixel 1 running Android 10, using the last update from the play store?  Hasn't opened for a while now.

What does `won't open` mean? black screen? how far it goes? if it was updated from an older version in play store, try to uninstall then reinstall again fresh

Is it easy to add a new Komodo based coin into AtomicDex? It was very easy in Barterdex.

Hellow, yesterday i was testing atomic-dex password leak as plaintext into "user custom learned words db" on multiple phones and android versions like android 5, 6... and all leaking.
By analysis, input fields ARE NOT protected when user clicks on unhide button before clicks on input field.
If user password is like "LetterLetterLetterNumSpecialSymbol" only special-symbol from pass is not stored in. But if hacker uses dictionary attack, pass can be broken by few minutes.

How difficult is it to get a coin added to ADX?

[18-Dec-19 06:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Adding to the backend is free , if you want in the mobile GUI there is a fee depending on the particulars of your coin.

I'm part of the DogeCash community and I saw Jared Tate's tweet about DEXes today. He mentioned Block DX and some others mentioned ADX in the thread. DOGEC is already on BDX but I was looking at your site and I'm really impressed!

[18-Dec-19 06:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@shane-615  from a brief look addition to mobile should be possible contact @PTYX  if you are interested in integrating dogecash

[18-Dec-19 06:37 PM] PTYX#6840
I'll send over the brochure
