If your boss starts talking about asset tokenization, custody service, DID, STO, or some form of alliance, leave the company immediately. 

When the industry has no vision, competing companies collectively gear toward the same dumb vision.

wtf?!?!? I looked at this doc, but it does have no author information whatsoever! no imprint, no name, no institution, nada, zilch, nothing , nix!
checking for author/imprint is usually first thing I do, before reading... 
Now this is funny, now I really wonder who wrote this

Thread on the #EUROChain. This thing is pure evil. It is the most invasive, orwellian, and authoritative financial system I've ever seen.

üê© üí© The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially
semi-anonymous. As you wanted. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments.
