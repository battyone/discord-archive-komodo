@artem.pikulin some swap files on the seed nodes (/SWAPS/STATS/MAKER/) have maker_coin, taker_coin, taker_amount and maker_amount set to `null`
here is an example

is this normal?

[18-Dec-19 11:03 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@cipi Yes, these are statuses broadcasted from outdated nodes that do not include these fields.

[18-Dec-19 11:03 AM] cipi#4502
interesting, thanks

```
0. alice sends DEX fee
1. alice sends coins to b address
2. bob sends coins to b address
3. bob spends coins from b address
4. alice spends coins from b address
```
is this the correct order for a swap? I keep finding ones where step 3 is confirmed after step 4 is confirmed

[18-Dec-19 03:20 PM] Alright#0419
which should never happen? ðŸ¤”

[18-Dec-19 03:20 PM] Alright#0419
could just be that blocktimes are inaccurate between the two chains, this is timestamp I'm looking at

[18-Dec-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as 3. is in the mempool, 4, is possible. nothing requires 3. to confirm before 4.

[18-Dec-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe you have 3 and 4 reversed, it should alternate who does the next step

[18-Dec-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but 3 and 4 can be thought to be simultaneous

[18-Dec-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
thank you

[18-Dec-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
yes seems I have them flipped, but shouldn't even really matter

[18-Dec-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
shouldn't alice sending to b address happen before bob sending to b address?

[18-Dec-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
isn't this how mm1 was? It prevented an evil Alice from locking up all of bob's coins for 4 hours

[18-Dec-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
if I'm understanding process correctly, alice can lock up bob's coins for 4 hours just for the cost of dex fee

[18-Dec-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
alternating between the 2

[18-Dec-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
alice, bob, alice, bob, alice

[18-Dec-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the dexfee needs to be big enough disincentive for alice to not want to do it just to tie up bobs funds

[18-Dec-19 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
believe i found why my volume scripts miss some swaps

[18-Dec-19 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
it was assuming that vout1 of dex fee transaction(step0) would always be spent in alice->b_addr (step2)

[18-Dec-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
need to work out when exactly this wouldn't be the case

[18-Dec-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
if it's common, this volume script is going to take even longer :L

[18-Dec-19 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
we could add some dummy vouts with data that would make this much much simpler to extract volume from blockchain data.... ðŸ˜…

[18-Dec-19 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise, we're relying on shotty seed node data that isn't immutable and isn't easily accessible to the public

[18-Dec-19 03:54 PM] Alright#0419
so like a CEX :abusedsmily:

[18-Dec-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
not saying seed node data is inherently "shotty", just that it can be and we cannot go back to check if it's 100% correct
