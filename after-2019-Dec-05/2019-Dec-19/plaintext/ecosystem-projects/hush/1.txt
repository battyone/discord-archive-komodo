Thread on the #EUROChain. This thing is pure evil. It is the most invasive, orwellian, and authoritative financial system I've ever seen.

7/ So large value transactions are approved/denied by an AML Authority with full access to user data. 

And small transactions? Enter what they call their "novel new concept" - Anonymity Vouchers.

Imagine being so oppressed that you must ask a central bank permission to have anonymity + pay them for the privilege! "Anonymity vouchers"!

EUROChain wants to monetize + remove every last bit of financial privacy you might have. Don't worry, they know what's best, right?...
