Same here for crashes

[08-Dec-19 12:18 AM] buralux#1776
Once enter the pin

[08-Dec-19 01:08 AM] ca333#0118
iOS issue reproduced - we will release hotfix update asap. (you can bypass the issue for now by switching to settings page right after entering the PIN - after doing so app won't crash again)

Thank you

Here for the coin sounds complaint. I see it's an iOS workaround. Now we need a workaround for the workaround.

[08-Dec-19 09:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Quickly switching to settings works to prevent crashing!

That voice is really upsetting

[08-Dec-19 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
"that voice"?

[08-Dec-19 10:11 AM] ca333#0118
audio notifications

[08-Dec-19 10:12 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
ahhh
thought maybe PTYX was being insulted üòõ

[08-Dec-19 10:13 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
I need to mute or I can only close the software

[08-Dec-19 10:13 AM] ca333#0118
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± which operating system are you using?

[08-Dec-19 10:13 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
android

[08-Dec-19 10:16 AM] ca333#0118
Thanks for your feedback - the audio notification is a very new feature and we will work on it to make it as pleasant/user-friendly as possible. On android we will likely add an option for a mute thats very close to total silence.

[08-Dec-19 10:22 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Would it not be possible to just remove the sound for android? Seems silly android users have to 'suffer' for an iOS workaround.

Thats not possible cuz of strict release requirements. Sound notification needs to be app-related and not a OS conditioned feature to bypass background process limitation.

[08-Dec-19 10:54 AM] Goku#9007
"cuz of strict release requirements."
But you mean the Apple App Store?
I think the PlayStore don't have that strict rules

[08-Dec-19 10:56 AM] Mark81#4505
I guess ca333 trying to say that it must be on both versions or other wise it wont pass ios store.

Wow didn't know that Apple sets rules for PlayStore Apps too

[08-Dec-19 11:05 AM] Mark81#4505
No they are not setting but in source code this playing sound cannot be ruled out by software automaticaly in terms  of  operating system where it is running.

[08-Dec-19 11:07 AM] Mark81#4505
So if Apple sees in code that software is checking if you're in ios then play sound and if in Android then dont they won't pass it. It affects in this way to both worlds by their market leader position.

Is the sound function new??? I cant turn off the sound...is playing the whole time. Also when atomic dex is in background. Its very annoying

[08-Dec-19 04:17 PM] coingirl87#6489
Why sound is neccesary ?

[08-Dec-19 04:27 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
scroll up a single page

[08-Dec-19 04:52 PM] coingirl87#6489
I never heard of this before and atomix dex is the only app on my smartphone which used that. A sound notification is okey but the sound is permanent so why it is neccesary to have a permanent annoying sound? Where is the sense?

[08-Dec-19 04:57 PM] Acura#2748
scroll up üòÑ

[08-Dec-19 04:59 PM] coingirl87#6489
Found nothing which answers my questions

[08-Dec-19 05:05 PM] Acura#2748
I found many answer in the last 48hours in this channels about this topic

[08-Dec-19 05:11 PM] coingirl87#6489
@ca333 when sound is neccesary, why not make sound of waves or better....fighting komodowaran?

[08-Dec-19 05:20 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
AtomicDEX is in beta and we're only just started testing this functionality. The major question now is whether the Apple would approve the background mode. If they will, then we'll be further improving this functionality with things like choosing different sounds, allowing you to use the sounds from your own sound library and such. Anyhow, thanks for testing the app!

Keeps crashing after update. Delete and redownload?

[08-Dec-19 07:40 PM] Flint#6435
now, during a swap, there is still some terrible sound of the voice of screaming children of some snatches of adult voices and this against the background of ringing coins and the sound of a drain

{Reactions}
awthanks 

[08-Dec-19 07:47 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
@MorganJekyll Downloading a previous build  (such as 0.2.7) should help for now as a workaround, TestFlight allows you to pick a previous build.

[08-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Immediately switching to settings prevents it to crash

[08-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(For me)

[08-Dec-19 07:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
After that its fine

[08-Dec-19 07:56 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
I just used previous build and it works. Thank you
