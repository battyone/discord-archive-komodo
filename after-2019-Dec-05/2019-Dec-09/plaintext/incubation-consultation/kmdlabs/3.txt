[08-Dec-19 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to b.. the onyl way to remove that code was to force push all the commits as 1m, but that one is now not there 游땐

[08-Dec-19 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
chain going up as soon as this builds, will wait until 1pm UTC to release params

[08-Dec-19 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`no one other than notaries should be running it`
then maybe it shouldn't be called "master"?

thought the whole point of testing a branch was to have it compiled NOT at the last second...

Would be nice if start was in two stages - chain params released to get firewalls prepped, addresses imported and initial sync etc - then the tx with coins for staking.

[08-Dec-19 12:18 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Haven't touched my staking node in weeks - and won't until a stable daemon is ready (unless a HF forces it)

[08-Dec-19 12:20 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Although - I might take the punt on moving to buster on the next update for that.

[08-Dec-19 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
pos64 branch will work fine for test

[08-Dec-19 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
but best to use my repo if you haven't built yet

[08-Dec-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the consensus code in komdo_bitcoind.h from the branch you first linked to seems to cover most of it

[08-Dec-19 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
if you just cloned alrighttt/komodo, you'll have to do it again, sorry :/

[08-Dec-19 12:26 PM] Alright#0419

not to mention python hates my VMs

[08-Dec-19 12:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
mostly my fault for using 16.04.

[08-Dec-19 12:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
18.04 next time

[08-Dec-19 12:42 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I had a trouble with 16.04 also. 18.04 has been good to me.

[08-Dec-19 12:43 PM] gcharang#6833
I'm not sure what specific problem with py you faced, but to properly run python3 scripts in my ubuntu16.04 that has default python2.7,
I have found that, installing a specific python3 version like 3.6 and  and referring to it explicitly when giving commands (running scripts or installing dependencies) works
Ex:
```
python3.6 -m pip install --user setuptools
python3.6 script.py
```
don't forget to change the first link of scripts from python3 to python3.6

[08-Dec-19 12:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats what I did

[08-Dec-19 12:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
installed 3.8 from source tarball

[08-Dec-19 12:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
then pip3.8 nstalled depends
