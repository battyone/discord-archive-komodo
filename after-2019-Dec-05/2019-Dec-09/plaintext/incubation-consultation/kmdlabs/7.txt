[08-Dec-19 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still angry and bitter, but mods be moddin' with new arbitrary "rules" that only apply to people they want them to apply to and only when they want them to apply, so I have to "behave" more 🤷🏽‍♂️

[08-Dec-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
is no one able to stay in sync with explorer node?

[08-Dec-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
I see no forks on either of my nodes

[08-Dec-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419

[08-Dec-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤣  
This is why I created the LabsNotary stuff... so 1 person can test shit and know wtf is going on

[08-Dec-19 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fail

[08-Dec-19 03:44 PM] CrisF#3405
@Oszy is it `84.79955` coins?

[08-Dec-19 03:45 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah

[08-Dec-19 03:45 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
Ok, I don't think it's prudent to continue with this chain for the contest. Seems an incredibly unfair launch. Please keep your nodes up, we will diagnose the problem and relaunch this tomorrow or the next day. I will send 20 KMD to each participant that has split so far. This wasn't a total waste, it shows that ac_staked chains would have broken at the hard fork.
