did git checkout pos64 after clone?

[08-Dec-19 04:43 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
getblock gives LOTS of output - and yes I git checkout pos64 and pull

[08-Dec-19 04:43 PM] dude#6062
`invalidateblock 07537648d10256b390492ad9e781125f883eb960e9c8cde203bf477dc920e500`
then
`reconsiderblock 037f2fe891df5319ff7444608824c9dc05b41adaf4f895a764b86a85abc7b0db`

[08-Dec-19 04:44 PM] dude#6062
actually that the right block hash

[08-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
don't think you want to invalidate 07537648d10256b390492ad9e781125f883eb960e9c8cde203bf477dc920e500 it's part of that "real" chain

[08-Dec-19 04:44 PM] dude#6062
yeah just saw that... my bad

[08-Dec-19 04:44 PM] dude#6062

Read back 15:45 today can't link from phone

[08-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Oszy#5734
`Ok, I don't think it's prudent to continue with this chain for the contest. Seems an incredibly unfair launch. Please keep your nodes up, we will diagnose the problem and relaunch this tomorrow or the next day. I will send 20 KMD to each participant that has split so far. This wasn't a total waste, it shows that ac_staked chains would have broken at the hard fork.`

[08-Dec-19 06:22 PM] dude#6062
bahaha how'd i miss that

[08-Dec-19 06:22 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

[08-Dec-19 11:33 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - I have this wrong somewhere.
I set `splitperc=0` but didn't have a pubkey set - funds are going to random segid's BUT they are new addresses. so original address tally net gain =0.

[08-Dec-19 11:37 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Set pubkey - now they are all going to pubkey

[08-Dec-19 11:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah i was thinking about this... are we counting TOTAL STAKES based on end balance... or are we relying on some verification of stakes from the segid addresses in the git repo?

[08-Dec-19 11:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
If it is just balance... no one should care

[08-Dec-19 11:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
randos are fine other than losing your stake in that specific segid

[08-Dec-19 11:42 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
but the only way to verify no cheating is to look at the original addresses as new addresses are unknown

[08-Dec-19 11:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
the chain was 100% PoS

[08-Dec-19 11:42 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
collusion

[08-Dec-19 11:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
easily traced

[08-Dec-19 11:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
tx of start coins went out in one tx to single segid0 addys

[08-Dec-19 11:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
simple to see who tried to collude and combine entry coins

[08-Dec-19 11:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
lot of work but - json all "new" addresses of puppet2 load these to winner1 wallet

[08-Dec-19 11:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
no tx's
