@kmdkrazy you run ./entercomp.py right?

[08-Dec-19 12:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_ran his mouth and wonders if that counts_

[08-Dec-19 12:58 AM] mrlynch#5735
trying to ascertain if i'm the only one that got uncompressed privkeys from that script or not

[08-Dec-19 12:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, yes

[08-Dec-19 12:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
pubkey starts with 04 so not sure if that's good either

[08-Dec-19 12:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
`afaik, yes` in that case.. no bueno

[08-Dec-19 01:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc, compressed always starts with 02 or 03

[08-Dec-19 01:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can only start with 02 or 03 if its compressed

[08-Dec-19 01:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll see if I can't find the old convo in the morning
I know there was a deep talk about it because I had a vanity that I couldn't use for something because it was uncompressed

[08-Dec-19 01:02 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's what i'm saying.. what i've got from entercomp.py is uncompressed

[08-Dec-19 01:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more than once?

[08-Dec-19 01:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ie every time?

[08-Dec-19 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So @Alright  fucked you guys too 🤣

[08-Dec-19 01:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't see how, it's a simple getnewaddress call followed by validate🤷🏽‍♂️

[08-Dec-19 01:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes

[08-Dec-19 01:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
every time

[08-Dec-19 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I was goin g to make you guys one with the LabsNotary... guss I will just ignore this stupid shit and keep going... no sleep for me

[08-Dec-19 01:08 AM] mrlynch#5735
same in python, python3 and python3.6

[08-Dec-19 01:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrlynch what daemon build/branch/repo did you use for komodod?

[08-Dec-19 01:08 AM] mrlynch#5735
kmdlabs/komdo master

[08-Dec-19 01:09 AM] mrlynch#5735
but entercomp.py doesn't use any komodod bin

[08-Dec-19 01:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`entercomp.py doesn't use any komodod bin`
it has to, that's what creates the keys

[08-Dec-19 01:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it runs a dummy chain

[08-Dec-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes. I will fix it soon. Please dont use it atm.... Git went weird.,... it turns out GitHub isnt a block chain 😂

[08-Dec-19 01:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sure, blame git

[08-Dec-19 01:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
<https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/blob/pos64test/entercomp.py>

[08-Dec-19 01:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
where tf does it run a dummy chain?

[08-Dec-19 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, yes, joker was right
@Alright feked it trying to be fancy

[08-Dec-19 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
what is feked?

[08-Dec-19 01:12 AM] mrlynch#5735
entercomp.py generates uncompressed keys/addresses/pubkeys/kittens

[08-Dec-19 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
your "homemade" key gen makes uncompressed keys

[08-Dec-19 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Give me a fwe houras.,.. its not even Sunday right.... are I not heaps in the future or somthing

[08-Dec-19 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[08-Dec-19 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[08-Dec-19 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
ok what is the issue with uncompressed

<https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/blob/c9f4becefb2144e8abee9b109b26130fffb476e2/entercomp.py>
worked right until you went pytarded

[08-Dec-19 01:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
:))

[08-Dec-19 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not aware of any issue that uncompressed keys would cause

[08-Dec-19 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/LabsNotary/tree/blackjok3r` 
I think h tyou may find this has maybe 0 bugs

[08-Dec-19 01:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I forget and I'm too ready to get laid to look back over the logs from the barterdex era

[08-Dec-19 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

just use mm1, it's feken built in

[08-Dec-19 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then see if the code changes randomly still

[08-Dec-19 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Try and make me delete all my accounts, prick

[08-Dec-19 01:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
900 ways to wrongly do a function james wrote like literally the day we started staking

[08-Dec-19 01:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽‍♂️

[08-Dec-19 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[08-Dec-19 01:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what branch?

[08-Dec-19 01:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
kmdlabs/master

[08-Dec-19 01:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
someone said master earlier

[08-Dec-19 01:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
no

[08-Dec-19 01:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pos64

[08-Dec-19 01:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
we still on pos64

[08-Dec-19 01:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
ah

[08-Dec-19 01:43 AM] mrlynch#5735
hold on.. don't we have it running on master in labs nn? 🤔

[08-Dec-19 01:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
master has the "fix" for pos64 that doesn't work, but it will not sync even if it did fix it

[08-Dec-19 01:43 AM] mrlynch#5735
no we don't.. sorry.. my bad

[08-Dec-19 01:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok special ed question... bash noob...

[08-Dec-19 01:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
What else needs to go in a .sh file to launch a chain?

[08-Dec-19 01:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
other than the komodod call and params?

[08-Dec-19 01:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
a goat sacrifice

[08-Dec-19 01:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
make sure you don't forget `#!/bin/bash` :troll:

[08-Dec-19 01:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
i got that part

[08-Dec-19 01:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
but two things...

[08-Dec-19 01:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
1. Permission denied so is there a step I need to do to the file to make it mine or w/e?

[08-Dec-19 01:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
sudo chown  daemonfox CFEKPOS1start.sh

[08-Dec-19 01:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
something like that...

[08-Dec-19 01:58 AM] mrlynch#5735
`chmod +x your_bash_script.sh`

[08-Dec-19 02:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
awesome

[08-Dec-19 02:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
that seems to have been it

[08-Dec-19 02:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
testing now after VM reboot

[08-Dec-19 02:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
worked TY mrlynch

[08-Dec-19 02:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
chmod +x is make executable?

[08-Dec-19 02:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
or allow execute?

[08-Dec-19 02:03 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes

[08-Dec-19 02:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
taking notes...

[08-Dec-19 02:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
about time i made a proper staking node and documented it with my own startup scripts

[08-Dec-19 02:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
you have 3 sections of permissions with 3 attributes
user group world (everyone else not the user, nor in any group permitted) 
each with
rwx - read, write, execute

[08-Dec-19 02:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
are they progressive or singular? If I give it +x does it naturally mean it gets r and w too?

[08-Dec-19 02:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
`ls -lah CFEKPOS1start.sh`
