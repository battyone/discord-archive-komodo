[08-Dec-19 02:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
if you have a `-` instead of `r`, `w` or `x` it means it's not allowed

[08-Dec-19 02:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes they all have execute permission

[08-Dec-19 02:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
i see and i get it!

[08-Dec-19 02:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
to give it to user only you would do
`chmod -x ...`
`chmod u+x ....`

[08-Dec-19 02:07 AM] mrlynch#5735
or use the number attribute which is a bit confusing at first but...

[08-Dec-19 02:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
very helpful

[08-Dec-19 02:08 AM] mrlynch#5735
<https://danflood.com/tech-stuff/chmod-cheat-sheet> got you covered bro

[08-Dec-19 02:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
SWEET

[08-Dec-19 02:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
oh so leading dah means file... to do t for a dir use d instead

[08-Dec-19 02:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
and now the numbers make that much more sense

[08-Dec-19 02:09 AM] mrlynch#5735
750 should be a good permission in this case

[08-Dec-19 02:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
bad habit chmod everything 777 imma have to remember not to do that ever again

[08-Dec-19 02:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
750 = -rwxr-x---

[08-Dec-19 02:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
777 is wide open

[08-Dec-19 02:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
yup

[08-Dec-19 02:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
was easiest to do when i started made all the things work lmao

[08-Dec-19 02:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
easiest for someone to inject malicious code and pop your box too

mhm

[08-Dec-19 02:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
no more says I

[08-Dec-19 02:11 AM] mrlynch#5735
for .conf files use 640

[08-Dec-19 02:11 AM] mrlynch#5735
that way only you have r/w access

man that was hard work

[08-Dec-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hope ity wasnt for nothing... Needed to be done for the longest time, and nobody did it.. .I assume because the first verison was so bad nobody know how it worked. 
This isll do 3rd party coins pretty easy aswsell

[08-Dec-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can run X iguanas at once ...

[08-Dec-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Perfect tool for me to create my own testnets

[08-Dec-19 07:22 AM] CMaurice#1685
modified splitter, selective iguana management will all be needed down the road. I've got  nice fat wallet for walletreset too.
Want this tested (perhaps not today)?

[08-Dec-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have tested most of it, there could be some rarre cases that throw things off, but I wsa happy with it this morning.

if they merged that, should be fine

[08-Dec-19 10:35 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
they merge things? since when? :troll:

[08-Dec-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
they include komodoplatform beta bins in their builds

[08-Dec-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
oh it won't work anyway, we need a slightly tweaked branch

[08-Dec-19 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
Premine will be evenly distributed to segid0 address of each participant

[08-Dec-19 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
from there the first split transactions **must** be to your 64 registered addresses

[08-Dec-19 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
anything not split to them initially will not count towards your score/balance

[08-Dec-19 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
what if we don't split?

[08-Dec-19 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
if you just stake from segid0, it's fine

[08-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
Am working on scripts that will weed out any cheaters(only way to cheat is receiving coins from someone else), they track it based on initial distribution to 64 registered addresses

[08-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
I'll have a control node using my registered addresses, this isn't competing. Will just keep the chain moving in the event of a stall

[08-Dec-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a chain on a branch it was ready togo even had a pool

[08-Dec-19 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
am curious to see how you plan on tracking every tx for a week

[08-Dec-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
