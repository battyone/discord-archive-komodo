having lots of nodes early chain is a crazy edge case ... still a 100% PoS chain is not a great plan...

[08-Dec-19 02:44 PM] Oszy#5734
meh.. balance 902.95, less and less every minute, resynced, imported addresses again

[08-Dec-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the BTC code relies on chain work to seek a chain... and with every single block at min diff... well

has the hardfork enabled yet or not?

[08-Dec-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should be impossible to lose transactions after hadfork.. because ti just uses the standard `SyncWithWallet`

[08-Dec-19 02:46 PM] Oszy#5734
stopped it, no point staking a fork

[08-Dec-19 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So you need me after all then ?

[08-Dec-19 02:58 PM] Oszy#5734
still shit

[08-Dec-19 02:59 PM] Alright#0419
is your node accepting any blocks at all?

[08-Dec-19 02:59 PM] Alright#0419
after initial sync?

[08-Dec-19 02:59 PM] Alright#0419
seems no?

[08-Dec-19 02:59 PM] Oszy#5734
how do I check that?

[08-Dec-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*has a branch that was tested as working 10 times at least*

[08-Dec-19 02:59 PM] Alright#0419
that might have malicious code in it

[08-Dec-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
great work.. .But its supposed to be broken ... so

[08-Dec-19 03:00 PM] Alright#0419

@Oszy if you fresh sync then let it sit for a minute

[08-Dec-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
does it stay in sync

[08-Dec-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did remove it and repoert it as soon as I saw it, not sure what else I was meant to do.. .huess nextr time, dont report it to anyone.. .that seems fing stuipid

[08-Dec-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
or does problem only occur after starting to stake?

[08-Dec-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
we need to audit it before we can use it

[08-Dec-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
simple as that, stop taking it personally

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
asdding dpow to a chain forking like that will probably make it worse

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Oszy#5734
@Alright it does accept the blocks

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to fix the actual probem causing it

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
Ok start staking

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
does it fork again?

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
syncing a chain now

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
happens every time?

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but i doubt Ihave your code

[08-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
do you have `-testnode=1` in your launch params?

[08-Dec-19 03:04 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[08-Dec-19 03:04 PM] Alright#0419

[08-Dec-19 03:04 PM] Alright#0419

[08-Dec-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
guys still ranting abuout JSON error... its not my code thats at fault.. there is a conversion table in komodo-cli

[08-Dec-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to match them up

[08-Dec-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I wrote all the scripts in LabsNotary

[08-Dec-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant please remove `-testnode=1` from your chain params and restart ASAP

[08-Dec-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so they all matched perfectly

[08-Dec-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
man I'm sorry ;_; really unbelievably stressed

[08-Dec-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
