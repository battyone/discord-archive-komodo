Peter brandt offering paid subscriptions...

[08-Dec-19 09:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I always wonder why winning traders would offer their ‘unique’ insights to others... as that would diminish their own returns.

[08-Dec-19 09:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless offcourse they arent really winning traders and are trying to increase profits by ‘teaching’ others

[08-Dec-19 09:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It’s like PE funds saying to other PE funds in what companies they are investing or what they are looking for in companies to invest in...

[08-Dec-19 09:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Wouldnt make sense either

[08-Dec-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
or fronts the trade

[08-Dec-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if he makes the trade first and then announces it and a lot of people follow it, he will boost the chances he is correct

Paid subscription means money earned with zero risk

[08-Dec-19 09:54 AM] Bitfinger#6245
I doubt 1 guy can move the market in his favor because of lots of followers... at least not for very long. The market does what it does and you better move with it or you lose. Teaching more people to trade better might help reduce the mad volatility though.

[08-Dec-19 10:09 AM] Mark81#4505
Paid subscription or not. Peter has earned his reputation as a making good analysis of markets.

[08-Dec-19 10:12 AM] Mark81#4505
Besides when you're good enough it is obviously  good choise to do that for living from paid subscriptions.

[08-Dec-19 10:15 AM] Bitfinger#6245
I agree totally and as I said, for a trader to able to make money with zero risk, it's a big thing. Especially someone who's been in the game so long. @Mark81

[08-Dec-19 10:16 AM] Mark81#4505
Also from subscriptions you are not paying capital tax as from  trades.

[08-Dec-19 10:18 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Good point

[08-Dec-19 10:18 AM] Mark81#4505
So from income tax you can deduct expenses that involved during making business.

[08-Dec-19 10:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh back in 2017/2018 there were a couple of crypto traders with large followings that had the ability to move markets

[08-Dec-19 10:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Them merely tagging a coin in a tweet made bots follow the calls and pump price 10%

[08-Dec-19 10:51 AM] Mark81#4505
On that Peter analysis i would highlight chance of bitcoin to violate longterm price channel and would that break bitcoin run for many years to come? What are whales response to that?

[08-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Bitfinger#6245
@Cryptoon yes I remember those euphoric times where a McAfee tweet would mean a guaranteed pump... until it wasn't. My point was more 'not for long' because the market always resumes what it was doing... just look at kmd the last week, even a crazy pump is retraced and goes lower

my current TA for KMD looking pretty similar, altho my first target would be between 10.7k and 11.4k, then small retrace to fuel up then continue up towards 15k to complete 3rd wave

[08-Dec-19 05:06 PM] Markus#5464
by then we would have gotten a golden cross on daily which would take us up to 19k area
