Is there some sort of hard limit on when a swap will timeout? I've had a taker order that has been at negotiated for a couple of days now

Hello i have a question concerning the `sync_status` object in the  `my_tx_history` sometimes inside this json object (in the additional info) we have :

- Possibility to have an error: code + message (this is optional)
- Possibility to have transaction left in case of success  (BTC/KMD coins...) (optional) 
- Possbility to have blockleft (Ethereum coins) (optional)

Am i right ?

[08-Dec-19 10:54 AM] Slyris#2880
Trying to design a c++ struct that fit the tx_history_answer:

```cpp
 struct sync_status_additional_error {
        std::string message;
        int code;
    };

    struct sync_status_eth_erc_20_coins {
        std::size_t blocks_left;
    };

    struct sync_status_regular_coins {
        std::size_t transactions_left;
    };

    struct sync_status_additional_infos {
        std::optional<sync_status_additional_error> error; ///< in case of error
        std::optional<sync_status_eth_erc_20_coins> erc_infos; ///< eth/erc20 related coins
        std::optional<sync_status_regular_coins> regular_infos; ///< kmd/btc/utxo related coins
    };

    struct t_sync_status {
        std::string state; ///< NotEnabled, NotStarted, InProgress, Error, Finished
        sync_status_additional_infos additional_infos;
    };

    struct tx_history_answer_success {
        std::string from_id;
        std::size_t skipped;
        std::size_t limit;
        std::size_t current_block;
        std::size_t total;
        std::vector<transaction_data> transactions;
        t_sync_status sync_status; 
        std::string raw_result; ///< internal
        int rpc_result_code; ///< internal
    };

    struct tx_history_answer {
        std::optional<std::string> error;
        std::optional<tx_history_answer_success> result;
    };
```

am i right @artem.pikulin  or @artemciy_dice ?

[08-Dec-19 10:55 AM] Slyris#2880
Not sure, i based this on the current documentation answer example, may be there is case that doesn't appear here ?

I compared it here and there with our sources and the c++ structure seems all right. Some possibly relevant pointers:

Thank's a lot for the answer !

@artemciy_dice Ok i have another question

[08-Dec-19 03:37 PM] Slyris#2880
How you know with my_tx_history

If i'm the sender or the receiver ?

[08-Dec-19 03:38 PM] Slyris#2880
For the current transactions

[08-Dec-19 03:40 PM] Slyris#2880
We agree that if my_balance change start with a `-` means that i'm sender otherwise i receive

[08-Dec-19 03:52 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
We send `my_amount` with every swap and we receive `other_amount` in every swap.

[08-Dec-19 04:05 PM] Slyris#2880
i mean for a simple withdraw_money @artemciy_dice 

i use tx_history for the portfolio part

[08-Dec-19 04:06 PM] Slyris#2880
i want to know through tx_history if i'm a sender or the receiver, but i guess my_balance_change is enough
