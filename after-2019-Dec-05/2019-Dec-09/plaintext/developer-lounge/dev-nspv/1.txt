I'm launching NSPV chain with the pinned parameters, on komodod 0.5.0 , but I'm not able to sync any block, Idk if it is just me

maybe try connecting to 5.9.102.210, the stated seed node seems to not accept more than a few connections

[08-Dec-19 06:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
actually I had to remove the `-nSPV=1` parameter when launching komodod, otherwise it wouldn't start syncing

-nSPV=1 makes it a superlite client, it wont sync

[08-Dec-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that is sort of the point for it

oh I didn't know that, thanks for the explanation
