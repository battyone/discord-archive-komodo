It seems in the past that @github Pages had "X-Frame-Options" HTTP header to prevent clickjacking but that it's no longer present.
This would mean all websites using Github Pages are vulnerable to clickjacking via evil iframes. Somebody please tell me this is not true. htt...

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is a really bad bug.

[08-Dec-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I don't get it

[08-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain what don't you understand?

[08-Dec-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Maybe people just don't know what clickjacking is

[08-Dec-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It let's me render good.com within an iframe on evil.com, and steal all the info you put in, or serve different content, like a backdoored wallet that steals all your funds

[08-Dec-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I tried to explain it as much as I could in a tweet. It's scary that people don't know what this is, to me the old fart, because it's very likely a way you will be scammed

[08-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> clickjacking and XSS are the two most common ways for evil websites to scam you into trusting them

[08-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Been studying and fixing this stuff for 20 years but still, nobody knows about this stuff. At some point, it feels like the industry prefers insecurity.

[08-Dec-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> wow, sounds pretty serious...

[08-Dec-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I know about clickjacking, cookie stealing, spoofing, login forms
