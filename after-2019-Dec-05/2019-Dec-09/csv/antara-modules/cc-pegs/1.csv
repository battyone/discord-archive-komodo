Eg 1000KMD, withdraw 180USDK.
KMD moons to $1.80, the 180USDK represents 10% of the mooning initial deposit.
To close account / self liquidate, the >50% debt ratio to enable this would mean withdrawing  further USDK (720), to take debt to 900USDK.  Self liquidate giving back 500KMD.

Maybe if self liquidate is <50% debt ratio, a 0.5% fee is reasonable for this type of line of credit?";"";"";

If you have coins you can always cover your debt and take the deposit. This case is when you have lost the coins but you account is not in big debt so you close your account and get the rest of KMD that is rest fro covering your debt. The question is should it there be a penalty as with this action you can influence the global ratio of pegs and maybe put it in liquidation zone";"";"";
