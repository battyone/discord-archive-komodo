@phm87 for the record, i am not against LN tech, in fact i designed it into the CHIPS gameplay. what i object to is pretending that LN is some sort of decentralized layer. for interfacing to a centralized service, using a non-decentralized onramp, seems like you are not increasing any exposure. just dont complain if it turns out there are some funds are not safu type of bugs. for buying a latte, sure. for making a 10 BTC deposit... probably not a good idea

[23-Dec-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
also LN seems to have built in dependency to segwit, when it doesnt actually need to do that. this reminds of microsoft methods

[23-Dec-19 09:08 AM] phm87#7395
Sorry for my wrong interpretation. As far as i know, there are limits (for safety) into LN around 0.04 BTC per channel and it is written everywhere that it is in development and subject to risks so unsure why someone will put 10 BTC on LN (maybe for profit/greed). I'd prefer that you discuss segwit with a LN developer rather than me.
About the centralization/decentralization, the network is very young and some big players tried to centralize it with bad results (LN.big still loose money). Mobile light wallets are using the default node (so LN mobile wallets suffer from the same problem that Ethereum have with infura infra)

[23-Dec-19 09:09 AM] phm87#7395
Anyway, you know how I talk about risk and about crypto, you know that I won't push users to put funds at risk

[23-Dec-19 09:14 AM] phm87#7395
@jl777c  I think that most of LN guys will agree with you about ``for buying a latte, sure. for making a 10 BTC deposit... probably not a good idea`` so we both agree that LN is designed for small amounts. If anybody change the code to be able to play with several BTC, he should know what he is doing (same apply if I overclock a CPU or if I tune up a car: most insurances don't work from this point). Same apply if I do weird transactions with LABS or Hush with one instable git branch

[23-Dec-19 09:15 AM] phm87#7395
About CHIPS, I think that it can be possible to perform a submarine swap between CHIPS and KMD/Hush/LABS. It can be cool

[23-Dec-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
as a centralized payment hub, LN has its place, but that is not replacing bitpay

[23-Dec-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
does LN need to be on both sides of the submarine?

[23-Dec-19 09:16 AM] phm87#7395
no no no

LN on one side : the secret preimage is revealed after paying the invoice
onchain on the other side: an HTLC is put in place with a timelack and using the hash of the preimage to be able to claim funds

it seems an mm2 module could be made to build in submarine swaps

[23-Dec-19 09:18 AM] phm87#7395
I'm still noob in bitcoin scripts but I think that mm2 can also work for this

[23-Dec-19 09:18 AM] phm87#7395
I agree with you

[23-Dec-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
as it has the require hashlocks and i assume timelocks

[23-Dec-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i appreciate you swimming against the current on this one, it is a good effort

I don't fight against you

[23-Dec-19 09:19 AM] phm87#7395
Thank you for the talk

[23-Dec-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yet somehow you feel that KMD is against LN

[23-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as tech isnt misrepresented, almost all tech has some usecases where it makes sense to be used. that is all i ask, like when the pro-segwit was saying it was a scaling solution, when it actually makes the blocks a little bigger (with same set of transactions)

[23-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
that is basically just lying and not a very good way

[23-Dec-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and you cant claim that the network cant handle 4MB blocks so the blocksize has to remain at 1MB, when segwit allows the block to be 4MB.

[23-Dec-19 09:24 AM] phm87#7395
I had long discussions with bitcoiners and consensus experts (guys similar to zawy but about consensus) on french chats about KMD whitepapers, I'm not here to copy paste disagreements

[23-Dec-19 09:24 AM] phm87#7395
I agree that segwit allows blocks to go up to sth like 4 MB

[23-Dec-19 09:25 AM] phm87#7395
the documentation says the same

[23-Dec-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
with dPoW, we have actual attacks that are stopped, proven with live tests.

[23-Dec-19 09:25 AM] phm87#7395
as these live tests are not publicly documented, it is difficult to proove anything

[23-Dec-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it is basically just a decentralized checkpoint, submitted by notaries

[23-Dec-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the attacks that were attempted and stopped was public

[23-Dec-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
chains that were being constantly attacked and now with dPoW are not attacked, this is public

[23-Dec-19 09:26 AM] phm87#7395
whatever the tech detailed discussion is about LN or dpow, it is easier to put in the same chat all the persons. I took hours of my time to copy paste explanations from one group to another group. It doesn't help

[23-Dec-19 09:27 AM] phm87#7395
The fast that attackers stopped to attack is indeed public but there is still no documented test of dpow

[23-Dec-19 09:27 AM] phm87#7395
anyway, we'll discuss such a test with notaries in privNN

[23-Dec-19 09:27 AM] phm87#7395
more transparency is always good

[23-Dec-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what exactly you mean about a documented test that is different than what was done, but nothing stops it from being done

[23-Dec-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and also the source code has always been open in the daemon

[23-Dec-19 09:29 AM] phm87#7395
I never saw any link to any documented test about dpow but I'd be happy to read, learn, execute test again

[23-Dec-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if a notarization is invalid, ignore it. if it is valid, then prevent reorging

[23-Dec-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
combined with dpowconfs allows to know when it is secure to trust a txid

[23-Dec-19 09:30 AM] phm87#7395
Compared to analysis of pos, pow and other stuff, there is a lack of written docs (math docs, theretical docs) on dpow and I never saw a documented test but I'll search

[23-Dec-19 09:30 AM] phm87#7395
pow and pos have some flaws that are documented (flaws of LN are also documented)

[23-Dec-19 09:31 AM] phm87#7395
it can be good for transparency to document problems of dpow

[23-Dec-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
what sort of math is there about a decentralized checkpoint?

[23-Dec-19 09:31 AM] phm87#7395
(Alright told me things in private, mostly theoric)

[23-Dec-19 09:32 AM] phm87#7395
I saw some calculations based on the number of connections between the 64 NN (on privNN), the risk of collusion (mostly theoric because we have good notaries) and so on

[23-Dec-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly, nothing is perfect, but having dPoW is much more secure than not having it, for some chains, without dPoW they are basically not usable. i dont talk about chains with a lot of hashpower already

[23-Dec-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the cost of attack is much much higher on a dPoW chain, than without. this is pretty clear

[23-Dec-19 09:33 AM] phm87#7395
I agree, dpow is good but we need more technical explanations about it.

[23-Dec-19 09:35 AM] phm87#7395
Most of ppl outside KMD are seeing NN as masternodes so they think that dpow is subject to all the attacks that exist on masternodes (whatever NN and MN are technically very different)

[23-Dec-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no point to debate people who dont bother to understand the most basic facts

[23-Dec-19 09:46 AM] phm87#7395
@jl777c  you said that LN is unsecure but the few users that lost funds were above limits and they did stupid moves (it is masochism to broadcast an old state of a channel). About the fast that it is a little bit centralized around few nodes (LN.big control 40% of LN nodes), most noobs are using eclair node (same problem apply for ethereum and infura infra). But as bitfinex opened a LN node, it might get centralized around bitfinex

[23-Dec-19 09:46 AM] phm87#7395
I hope that in a few weeks, Binance will use his LN node on mainet then it will be also centralized around Binance

[23-Dec-19 09:47 AM] phm87#7395
But today's LN tpology gives you right : it is centralized around few nodes. But it tends to be more decentralized with the time

[23-Dec-19 09:47 AM] phm87#7395
eclair LN node was pretty the only one used few years ago, now CEX wants to have their LN node, it is fun

[23-Dec-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the prediction was that LN will lead to centralized hubs and that is exactly what is happening

[23-Dec-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
where the CEX are becoming the centralized hubs

[23-Dec-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
with KYC, just as predicted

[23-Dec-19 09:48 AM] phm87#7395
I can show you that all measures show that it is getting more decentralized

[23-Dec-19 09:49 AM] phm87#7395
there are 3 LN exchanges, no KYC

[23-Dec-19 09:49 AM] phm87#7395
I won't add a KYC into atomicdex if I enable submarine swaps (with LN so)

[23-Dec-19 09:49 AM] phm87#7395
KYC is mostly for fiat or big amounts (for AML regulation), not related to LN

[23-Dec-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but practically speaking the vast majority of LN volumes will go via these CEX nodes which will then be forced to KYC

[23-Dec-19 09:50 AM] phm87#7395
maybe in the future

[23-Dec-19 09:50 AM] phm87#7395
but right now, the biggest volumes is not coming from the usual CEX. Biggest volume were in some services providers (phone stuf, VPS). Anyway, it can evolve pretty quickly

[23-Dec-19 09:51 AM] phm87#7395
LN.big arrived and added 40% to LN funds, controlling 40% of nodes and creating channels with everyone, they arrived in one week. It was scary

[23-Dec-19 04:15 PM] joe2x4#5987
This is what I was expecting, stablecoins on physical medium will simply become cash. How exciting to be able to print your own cash.

```https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/armstrongeconomics101/economics/will-store-gift-cards-become-cash/
There seems to be a loophole right now with the gift cards. When I tried to buy an American Express debit card and load it with a couple hundred for a gift to send overseas, I was told I could not. It can only be in my name. As it stands now, if governments eliminated paper money but still allowed gift cards in bearer form, then they would simply become cash. It would seem that store cash gift cards would become the circulating cash in the black market economy. When that becomes more commonplace, they would probably shut that down or make them non-transferable in some name that is specific.```

Just for the record, segwit was always a blocksize increase, there was massive misinformation to hide that fact, but it was all there:

Is SegWit a block size increase?
Yes! Segregated witness replaces the block size limit with a new block weight limit, counting each byte of witness data as 1 unit of weight…

ETH inflation is for bagholding plebs so they don’t care. The #Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik, and devs all got their coins from the 70 million ETH premine and have already “diversified” into other assets. Happy Hard-Fork New Year! 🎉🍻 https://t.co/tNYvbbjXZ5
