the world that will change over the next two years will be beyond your imagination. and at the center of that change will be bitcoin.

I hope you don't be fooled by the lie of bitcoin being bad and blockchain being good.

the next 20 years are the era of the United States and Japan.

Nobody knows. Some say it needs based to TA. Others say its because successful network upgrade. Everyone have their opinion but nobody still believes pumps last. Not until we start thinking it cant go higher and it does. Once you get FOMOed to buy its too late to. You were supposed to buy when it went down. And back then you were to fairful to but put your money at stake.

altho end of year rally might happen, happened last year aswell not saying it will happen again just a possibility

[23-Dec-19 11:58 AM] Markus#5464
but if it does, dont be greedy. Take profits off the table and buy back cheaper, a massive 50-100% pump is not sustainable

[23-Dec-19 12:02 PM] Markus#5464

[23-Dec-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464

[23-Dec-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464
pump is over, was just a quick bounce to make a retest of 0.618% from previous high
