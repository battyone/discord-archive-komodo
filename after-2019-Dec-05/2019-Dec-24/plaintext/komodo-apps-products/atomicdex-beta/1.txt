@alcadi use <https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards>
to check if you are receiving rewards for an address
if you receive coins to your wallet from an exchange, sending the whole balance to yourself will correct any problems

[23-Dec-19 02:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@CoinKing88  z transactions are invisible on the  blockchain called  "shielded" transactions - google  zk-snarks  - ALL Komodo asset chains are capable of  this  function including Komodo itself obviously.  Zcash, Hush and Pirate / "ARRR" currently have working  models where the default for most coins is  using  standard unshielded transactions,  ARRRs  ONLY  choice is a  "z" transaction  or  shielded transactions which  makes swaping almost impossible because of the lack of data transmitted between Maker and Taker.. There  may  be  other  workarounds but I  am  suggesting a unshielded token swap of ztomic and final stage of swap would  be  done  with  the zCOIN  of choice ...  want  to  talk about a Blur Network? wrap that puppy up  in  tor and VPN with  ALL  Komodo-Platforms assets using the new shielded  method for  transaction and  you just  created  the Holy Grail trading platform for all  man kind --- It pretty much  is the missing  piece of the entire Decentralized  / Anonymous goals trying to be reached .   --- quite a few github locations to  find starter code for anyone  willing to  take  on  the challenge -  https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet-sdk   |||"These  are  kmdkrazy  opinions  and  are  not intended to sound  like  factual  statements  in  any  way, nor  are  they  endorsed  by  SuperNET and  or  its  subsidiaries."|||  ~ lol

I  guess you  can call  it a "cc-ztomic"

[23-Dec-19 02:27 AM] alcadi#7378
@gcharang thanks mate

[23-Dec-19 07:10 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Thanks @kmdkrazy for the effort to inform me. I understand it's a difficult task to swap a coin that is designed to be invisible.

[23-Dec-19 07:40 AM] CoinKing88#1540
@kmdkrazy How does a ARR wallet know how much ARR somebody has? When he or she received the coins the wallet has to acknowledge that, can't u use the same principle for the swap (which basically is A to B through C)?

[23-Dec-19 07:47 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Further if you swap a zk-snark coin you always have to finish the swap shielded i imagine van start to end. If not, part 2 of the swap will make part 1 visible or at least reconstructable (for example is you swap ARR for non-shielded KMD, the output of KMD to the address ARR came from is now known for swapping a non-visible amount that equals the value of the received KMD.

[23-Dec-19 07:52 AM] Acajoo#6253
Is it safe to make a swap on AtomicDex considering that it's in beta?

[23-Dec-19 07:52 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Yeah, the coins currently listed are 100% safe to swap

[23-Dec-19 07:53 AM] Acajoo#6253
Is there a ETH/BTC pair?

[23-Dec-19 07:53 AM] gcharang#6833
there has not been an instance of lost funds yet
but still, swaping low volumes is recommended for now

[23-Dec-19 07:54 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Ethereum is available, liquidity may be limited. Most swaps happen around KMD (BTC/KMD, KMD/DEX etc.)

[23-Dec-19 07:55 AM] gcharang#6833
there is no concept of a pair  being available in AtomiocDEX
if the coins are listed, they can be traded against each other

[23-Dec-19 07:56 AM] Acajoo#6253
Is it planned to add WBTC?

[23-Dec-19 07:58 AM] Acajoo#6253
By WBTC I mean Wrapped BTC...

[23-Dec-19 07:59 AM] Acajoo#6253
Sorry for so much questions guys

[23-Dec-19 07:59 AM] Acajoo#6253
ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Dec-19 08:07 AM] Acajoo#6253
I have read that AtomicDex doesn't allow withdrawals to Segwit address, does it support deposits from Segwit address?

[23-Dec-19 08:08 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Yes it does support deposits from segwit, i tried that myself

[23-Dec-19 08:08 AM] gcharang#6833
> AtomicDex doesn't allow withdrawals to Segwit address
for now
> does it support deposits from Segwit address?
yes

[23-Dec-19 08:08 AM] gcharang#6833
re: wbtc
I am not sure if there are plans to list it

[23-Dec-19 08:09 AM] Acajoo#6253
Thank you for your quick answers guy, you are great ðŸ˜Š

[23-Dec-19 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
no problem, feel free to ask any other questions ðŸ˜„

[23-Dec-19 08:10 AM] Acajoo#6253
I will try AtomicDex today

[23-Dec-19 08:11 AM] Acajoo#6253
What is the stablecoin with most liquidity listed on AtomicDex?

[23-Dec-19 08:20 AM] gcharang#6833

[23-Dec-19 08:21 AM] gcharang#6833
^ the pic has the available stable coins

[23-Dec-19 08:21 AM] Acajoo#6253
If I create a large order, do I have to wait for a single user to fill that order or many  users can grab a piece of my order?

[23-Dec-19 08:25 AM] gcharang#6833
> many  users can grab a piece of my order
this
but there might be slight delays from one user filling the order to the next one as actual coins on the blockchain need to move and confirmations on blockchains take some time

Thanks ðŸ˜Š Anything else I should care about? Any advice?

[23-Dec-19 08:26 AM] gcharang#6833
just trade rick and morty coins first to get a feel for it
then you can go on to real coins

[23-Dec-19 08:27 AM] gcharang#6833
create a wallet and get coins from the faucet <https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/rick>

[23-Dec-19 08:28 AM] Acajoo#6253
Thank you very, very much

Hi dev,
I use my seed phrase for exodus, which I generated in atomic dex
I have bitcoin in atomic dex but after I transfer my phrase to exodus there arenâ€™t my btc
why?

[23-Dec-19 11:46 AM] Oszy#5734
@alesha123 It is not a bip39 compatible seed. You can use your seed in Agama, not in exodus.

[23-Dec-19 11:46 AM] Oszy#5734
same as you can't use ledger seed in atomicdex

[23-Dec-19 11:47 AM] alesha123#1898
Oh so does this only work for Komodo funds?

[23-Dec-19 11:49 AM] Oszy#5734
yes, the addresses generated will be different in other applications not related to komodo

[23-Dec-19 11:49 AM] Oszy#5734
but it will always be the same in agama / atomicdex

[23-Dec-19 11:50 AM] alesha123#1898
So basically it is used only for authorization?

[23-Dec-19 11:51 AM] Oszy#5734
no, it has the same security and purpose as a regular BIP39 seed, but it uses a different method, only used by komodo. 
someone correct me if I am wrong ðŸ™‚

[23-Dec-19 12:06 PM] alesha123#1898
thanks for making this clear

[23-Dec-19 12:38 PM] alesha123#1898
Please specify which method?

[23-Dec-19 04:02 PM] _PureHate_#9411
first time i hear the music lol

[23-Dec-19 04:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
@CoinKing88 I an not a  computer  science  major  - but I did play one on TV  - Basically you  would be swapping the ztomic with  standard Atomic Dex then releasing the zadd  funds  from  timelock p2sh add  at  final  stage --- i think ---http://stevengoldfeder.com/papers/ZKCSP.pdf

[23-Dec-19 04:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
as far  as  trading  a  Z add for R add -  you are  correct - but it would/will  be a safer  decentralized  trade

[23-Dec-19 04:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Company  A  sells  crack  cocaine  and  only wants  paid in  ARRR  Buyer  B  only  has  Shitcoin  - Buyer  B  swaps Shitcoin  for  ARRR  then pays the dealer  and  gets his crack - Thats  real  world  use  case

[23-Dec-19 04:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The VaraPAY  system  I  was  working  on  relys  on  liquidity /market  makers, this  is  why integrating  CEX  trades  into  AtomicDEX  is  important  for  mass  consumption ... Q2  2020  --- just kidding  I have no Idea  on  the dates  they are  integrating API calls  to CEXs ---But  it  is  on the list!!

[23-Dec-19 04:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
we  need  more  DEVS!!!!!!!  MOAR COWBELL!!

[23-Dec-19 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
@CoinKing88 `Yeah, the coins currently listed are 100% safe to swap`
Please don't make this assurance. It is a beta software. While it's unlikely you will face issues, you should treat it as such.
