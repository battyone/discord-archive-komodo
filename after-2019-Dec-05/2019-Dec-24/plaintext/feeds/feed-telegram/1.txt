[telegram] <Mixic> Announcing the 0.0.4-alpha version of the Verus Desktop, the new, multicoin native and Lite mode wallet for Verus, KMD, Zcash, BTC, and more, including VerusID, and a completely redesigned user interface. 
In addition to speed, usability improvements, and bug fixes, Verus Desktop now also includes a terminal to communicate directly with any running blockchain daemons. 
To access it simply go into settings > coin settings and select a coin from the dropdown.
Thank you all for your valuable feedback and bug reports on the wallet so far. 
The wallet is still under development, and a more detailed list of what still needs to be done is on the release linked to below, but this release brings Verus Desktop one step closer to being the main Verus wallet, and we hope you enjoy using it.
