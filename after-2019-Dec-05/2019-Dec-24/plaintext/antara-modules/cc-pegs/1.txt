About apow, I added a previous version of jl777 work into CHIPS, I still need to test it in details.
I read that apow code needed fune tuning when used with price_cc or with some blocktimes. Do you think that I should read the new changes to apow of jl777 or is it unrelated to Chips ?
Thank you

might as well merge in the latest fix, it adds options for the filters being used
