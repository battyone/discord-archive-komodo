[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I am talking about a marketing plan on #off-topic , too. There just doesn't seem to be that many people seeing this. I hope there was as this plan doesn't cost anything to execute but it needs a few people.

[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> hello my friend how are u doing today

[23-Dec-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> has the team thought about developing a private OS for mobile?

[23-Dec-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> comes with message and call apps, private browser, vpn+tor, and mobile wallet

[23-Dec-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> Mobile is extremely difficult Dutchman

[23-Dec-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> Due to mobile being very 'eponymous'

[23-Dec-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> That being said I am sure the devs are constantly thinking of ways around it

[23-Dec-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
