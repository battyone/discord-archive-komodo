Zcash, Hush and Pirate / ""ARRR"" currently have working  models where the default for most coins is  using  standard unshielded transactions,  ARRRs  ONLY  choice is a  ""z"" transaction  or  shielded transactions which  makes swaping almost impossible because of the lack of data transmitted between Maker and Taker.. There  may  be  other  workarounds but I  am  suggesting a unshielded token swap of ztomic and final stage of swap would  be  done  with  the zCOIN  of choice ...  want  to  talk about a Blur Network? wrap that puppy up  in  tor and VPN with  ALL  Komodo-Platforms assets using the new shielded  method for  transaction and  you just  created  the Holy Grail trading platform for all  man kind --- It pretty much  is the missing  piece of the entire Decentralized  / Anonymous goals trying to be reached .   --- quite a few github locations to  find starter code for anyone  willing to  take  on  the challenge -  https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet-sdk   |||""These  are  kmdkrazy  opinions  and  are  not intended to sound  like  factual  statements  in  any  way, nor  are  they  endorsed  by  SuperNET and  or  its  subsidiaries.""|||  ~ lol","",""
