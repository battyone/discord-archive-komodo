So we could possibly on board windows developers. especially so they could do cc development. This is for start.

Later having an interface layer on top of them (wrapping internal c/c++ stuff) so that other developers with a knowledge of other programming languages could also develop cc modules with their own preffered language.

All of it as a way to increase developer adoption and let developers experiment with the platform in a fast, smooth and convenient way.","",""

I think that 97 out of a 100 developers would choose to develop smart contract on ethereum or other platforms because it is much easier.

And if I understand you correctly msvc is not supported atm.
If you take a random developer, he probably doesn't know c++ nor linux (not to mention development on linux). Atm he is basically cut off.

The numbers speak for themselves.
How many developers *inside* this community have developed smart contracts? It is just too complex atm.

And if you talk about contributers, your project has just 3 of them. One of them is you and the other is jl.

With eth he could have his smart contract running over a weekend. Here this is not the case. It would probably take him weeks if any. This is the whole difference.","",""
"345544724167524352","Decker#3767","23-Dec-19 05:05 PM","To be honest, i never tried to develope ETH smart contracts, only had quick read few docs about this. But anyway, ETH smart contracts and Komodo UTXO based CC contracts is a different things. CC is more low-level thing and it require from dev deep understanding how the blockchain works, what is the utxos, and how bitcoin stack-based scripting system works. Without these knowledge, of course, it's hard to begin with CC. And to begin with ETH smart contracts it's enough to copy & paste any smart contract template and start with it. But this have an other side ... just remember how many news was about ETH, like ""funds was frozen/stolen bcz of error in smart contract"" ... )","",""

I'm well aware about the differences between account based eth and utxo cc.
But it doesn't mean we shouldn't try consistently to lower the entry barrier.
Windows development and interfacing with other languages could have a big effect in this direction. Other steps could be  having walkthrough videos on youtube on a simple smart contract development","",""
