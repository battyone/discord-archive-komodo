[dscrd-prt] <Flint> @JiuCrypto You correctly already noted above that the issue of wallets is acute because in order to integrate a coin into markets on the Internet and other services you need lightweight clients that do not require downloading the entire blockchain

[dscrd-prt] <Flint> and as soon as this happens, at least for the first time on the darknet, popularity will be ensured as at one time with XMR and BTC and then this dark page of history can be forgotten when it becomes the one that was created by the digital offshore for all without censorship!
