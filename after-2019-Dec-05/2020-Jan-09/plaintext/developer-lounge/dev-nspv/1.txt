[08-Jan-20 12:14 AM] Regnar#6164
so is it the port number choice?

[08-Jan-20 12:18 AM] Paro#7842
rpcport 47509
p2pport 47508

[08-Jan-20 12:18 AM] Paro#7842

[08-Jan-20 12:48 AM] Regnar#6164
does your chain have dPoW?

[08-Jan-20 12:50 AM] Regnar#6164
I think nSPV only works with dPoW, otherwise what would be the purpose of syncing to the last notarized point if your chain isn't the one being notarized?

[08-Jan-20 12:52 AM] Paro#7842
the problem I think on our server

[08-Jan-20 12:52 AM] Regnar#6164
okay so yes dPoW

[08-Jan-20 12:54 AM] Regnar#6164
what are the params you use to set up the full node?

[08-Jan-20 01:00 AM] Paro#7842
```./komodod -ac_name=MARMARATEST -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=3000000000 -pubkey= &
```

[08-Jan-20 01:00 AM] Regnar#6164
I think you need `-nSPV=1`

[08-Jan-20 01:01 AM] Regnar#6164
check the channel message*

[08-Jan-20 01:01 AM] Regnar#6164
```./komodod -nSPV=1 -ac_reward=100000000  -ac_name=NSPV -ac_supply=10000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -connect=5.9.102.210 &
./komodod -nSPV=1 -addnode=5.9.253.195 &```

```

[08-Jan-20 01:02 AM] Regnar#6164
yea maybe

[08-Jan-20 01:04 AM] Regnar#6164
oh wait nvm

[08-Jan-20 01:05 AM] Regnar#6164
that's to run the Komdod as nSPV and not full node

[08-Jan-20 01:05 AM] Paro#7842
i saw

[08-Jan-20 01:05 AM] Paro#7842
But I've never used it like this before.

[08-Jan-20 01:06 AM] Regnar#6164
I mean, adding it to the params would (i think) make your full node an nSPV only. which isn't what we want.

[08-Jan-20 01:06 AM] Paro#7842
no

[08-Jan-20 01:06 AM] Paro#7842
I want to use "libnspv".

[08-Jan-20 01:06 AM] Regnar#6164
So there is probably some other reason the regular nspv isn't working

[08-Jan-20 01:06 AM] Paro#7842
But he's making mistakes the way I used it before.

[08-Jan-20 01:07 AM] Paro#7842
yes connecting works breaks after 3-5 seconds https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/594906735467036682/664264591412297758

[08-Jan-20 01:07 AM] Paro#7842
I don't think it's compatible with MarmaraCC.

[08-Jan-20 01:08 AM] Paro#7842
MarmaraCC has changed a lot.

[08-Jan-20 01:08 AM] Paro#7842
Look at when @dimxy  or @jl777c  arrives.

[08-Jan-20 01:09 AM] Paro#7842
we'll make a nspv wallet

[08-Jan-20 01:11 AM] Regnar#6164
sounds good, nSPV is pretty new to me as well

[08-Jan-20 01:11 AM] Paro#7842
nspv is very easy and very nice.

[08-Jan-20 01:14 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea so far it is great

[08-Jan-20 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
was this issue resolved?

[08-Jan-20 06:50 AM] Paro#7842
Unfortunately, it's not solved. It's still going on.

[08-Jan-20 06:51 AM] Paro#7842
I've tried every branch.

[08-Jan-20 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
do you get peers?

[08-Jan-20 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
does the basic wallet info work?

[08-Jan-20 07:39 AM] Paro#7842
yes

[08-Jan-20 07:39 AM] Paro#7842
There are problems MarmaraCC also i think it stems from this.

[08-Jan-20 07:40 AM] Paro#7842
the prize earned. "blockchain" again deletes

[08-Jan-20 07:42 AM] Paro#7842
I'm trying to identify the error

[08-Jan-20 07:43 AM] Paro#7842
That's another problem.  `It has nothing to do with "nspv".`
