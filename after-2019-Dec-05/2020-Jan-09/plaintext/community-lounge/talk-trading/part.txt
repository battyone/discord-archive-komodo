you are talking about day trading here, but I look even at the MONTHLY timeframe on Binance and see no less potential pain

[08-Jan-20 02:21 PM] Lanii#8302
Also I disslike the term "daytrading". Imo trading shouldn't take much time at all when you know what you are doing. You should understand a chart within minutes, take your setup and then its a waiting game untill you get filled.

[08-Jan-20 02:21 PM] Markus#5464
and why 99% of traders lose money is cause they are in profit and get greedy instead of getting out and take profit and be happy with it

[08-Jan-20 02:22 PM] farl#9964
Even the most professional ones have these emotions.

[08-Jan-20 02:22 PM] Markus#5464
u cant have emotions in trading, u stay to rules

[08-Jan-20 02:22 PM] farl#9964
Peace

[08-Jan-20 02:23 PM] looye29#2126
Also professional lose money. But the trick is to gain more than lose money.

[08-Jan-20 02:23 PM] farl#9964
I have to many feelings for my holdings, that's why I don't daytrade. üíö

[08-Jan-20 02:23 PM] Markus#5464
u can lose 7 out of 10 trades and still be profitable, cause those 7 loosing trades were just a small piece

[08-Jan-20 02:23 PM] Lanii#8302
@looye29 Yep, alot of people think TA is about predicting the market and you are either 100% right or a losing trader, which is false false false

[08-Jan-20 02:25 PM] looye29#2126
Fib circles and other tools help but still it can go up or down. Nobody can see the future through crystal ball

[08-Jan-20 02:25 PM] Flint#6435
when the price returns to peaks six months ago at $ 1.8, then Komodo will face an unprecedented crisis of loyalty as everyone starts selling and recovering losses from the bear race! I hope there are not those left who bought for $ 12?üòÇ

[08-Jan-20 02:25 PM] farl#9964
HODL imo does not mean Holding Forever. Every time my positions gain 50% I will sell 15%, and some 100% rise and sell 20%. So I don't have to follow news, emotions or black swans. Just my strategy and stick to it. That's is what I learned. I am less stressed and have more time. üëå

[08-Jan-20 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
and what if u buy and it dump 70%

[08-Jan-20 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
what u do

[08-Jan-20 02:26 PM] farl#9964
Hodl

[08-Jan-20 02:26 PM] Markus#5464
it might never recover

[08-Jan-20 02:26 PM] farl#9964
No emotions, stick to the plan

[08-Jan-20 02:26 PM] looye29#2126
One important thing never be emotional bound to your trades

[08-Jan-20 02:26 PM] looye29#2126
Haha

[08-Jan-20 02:27 PM] farl#9964
The people who sell at 70% loss are the real losers. HODL! That's the risk you took when you stepped into crypto.  ‚úä

[08-Jan-20 02:28 PM] farl#9964
KMD was about $7 the last time I sold a bit.

[08-Jan-20 02:28 PM] looye29#2126
Crypto is always risk. It is up to you how much risk you wanna take

[08-Jan-20 02:29 PM] farl#9964
The beauty of crypto is the risk-reward ratio. High risk, but also very high rewards.

[08-Jan-20 02:29 PM] designer#4893
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

[08-Jan-20 02:30 PM] farl#9964
So KMD lost about 90% since $7, did I sell any....NO. 
HODL!

[08-Jan-20 02:30 PM] looye29#2126
There are people who bought bitcoin cheap but are affried to miss out when it gets higher and never sell it.

[08-Jan-20 02:30 PM] Flint#6435
a hacker with an Agama wallet has done irreparable damage to his reputation in the foreseeable future, and this fact should be recognized! NOBODY in their right mind will no longer transfer serious amounts to wallets. Only cold wallets now have trust, but not Komodo products, and the reputation remains to be washed off for a very long time, and for this there is no practical solution for theory and daydreaming

Calculate how many rise in percentage you want and sell 10-20% each time. This time, you keep most of your coins, but occasionally earn $$$ or ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨

[08-Jan-20 02:33 PM] farl#9964
You can use it for different coins, just use the calculations.

[08-Jan-20 02:33 PM] looye29#2126
Luckily you can store KMD on ledger hardware

[08-Jan-20 02:34 PM] Flint#6435
why do not we see new trading pairs and expansion of liquidity but only its decrease? and has it been a long time? the rhetorical question and time plays against those projects for whom it is increasingly difficult to explain to the community that we have a special way and we still have to wait 1. 2. 5 . 10 . years - underline as necessary

A usdt pair on Binance for KMD would be very welcome, is Binance asking too much money for that or did the team never asked for it?

[08-Jan-20 04:07 PM] Flint#6435
the only thing I believe that KMD will save is the creation of the DeFI mechanism and the creation on the platform of stablecoins and futures for gold, oil and other traditional assets with KMD blocking and it should be just as easy to do so that I don‚Äôt need to learn C ++ and so that it can do my grandmother is in the application but so far the KMD application can only make vile sounds because of which I want to immediately turn off the application and this is after several updates and can ‚Äúplease‚Äù with the absence of an order book and less liquidity than snow in the mountains of Alaska !

[08-Jan-20 04:08 PM] Flint#6435
@CoinKing88 KMD has no liquidity for this

[08-Jan-20 04:40 PM] Mark81#4505
Bitcoin is dropping. War is canceled by Trump.

[08-Jan-20 04:46 PM] Lanii#8302
Btc is dropping, who coulda guessed

[08-Jan-20 05:28 PM] richardt#2807
@Flint True. The real demand for KMD is almost zero at this point in time. But then most eyes are on BTC right now. People could care less about alts

[08-Jan-20 05:31 PM] richardt#2807
Also, most alts have too many heavy bag holders.

[08-Jan-20 05:32 PM] richardt#2807
Difficult to see any sustainable price increase when so many people are on the sidelines looking to get out

@richardt Today, REAL value are those coins that have REAL use, and these are only BTC, XMR for darknet, ETH for creating stablecoins and trading in pairs with major currencies, and another BNB that is also used a lot! the rest can be removed and the market will not notice any damage, but will only improve because no one has a real use case! here, for the sake of fairness, you can add stablecoins not on the ETH blockchain.

[08-Jan-20 07:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Better start shilling ARRR on silkroad then

[08-Jan-20 07:26 PM] Bitfinger#6245
XMR is so shitty Fluffy Pony rather wants to make rip-off crypto kitties

[08-Jan-20 08:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Flint i ask this of everyone. The ones that complain about price and why this project is going to 0. Since you are here, i am guessing you hold some KMD. The question is not why the teams hasnt made us rich yet, the question is what have you done to help increase the value of your investment.

For the most part, the successful projects have community members invest their time and money into a project to increase it. They dont buy and sit back and wait for the money to rain.

[08-Jan-20 08:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So everyone should take some responsibility for the price of THEIR investments.

[08-Jan-20 08:17 PM] Markus#5464
missed that 8400 short today when i was at work....rip that would of been a pretty good trade

[08-Jan-20 08:17 PM] Markus#5464

[08-Jan-20 08:25 PM] Lanii#8302
Almost got tagged by 10 dollars, huh

[08-Jan-20 08:26 PM] Markus#5464

[08-Jan-20 08:26 PM] Lanii#8302

@hyperDEX Have I invested part of my funds? is this not enough? But excuse me without such a ‚Äúhelp‚Äù to the project, he would be completely dead - I don‚Äôt lose coins even when we break a new bottom like weak hands do and it‚Äôs not greed! I'm already tired of advertising a coin among friends who laugh at the price, preferring to invest in bitcoin! I stayed with the project even after my funds disappeared from the wallet and then it turned out to be a ‚Äúsmart hacker from the community‚Äù, so maybe it is the turn of the creators to make the token useful? I don‚Äôt ask to make me rich at the click of a finger, but we don‚Äôt see anything but the theory, we don‚Äôt see new trading pairs and we don‚Äôt see liquidity, and by the way, such faithful holders like me do not let the price drop to zero and feed developers who have not a zero cost DAILY remuneration even when they do not write the code and do not conclude listing transactions with exchanges and do not conduct marketing? Again I ask the question that after that I and I like do little? Are apple stock buyers involved in apple developments? Or advertise it? But we ask you to at least give the token usefulness for these few years while the use of this token is only an issue and sale by those who earn money on a coin to anyone who got it for free!

[08-Jan-20 09:17 PM] richardt#2807
@hyperdex it seems to me what KMD needs most is funding and more devs to move the projects forward. Not investors without technical skills getting more involved

[08-Jan-20 09:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd has plenty of funding I think ü§î

[08-Jan-20 09:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
One of the few projects actually continually hiring good devs

[08-Jan-20 09:26 PM] phm87#7395
``Kmd has plenty of funding I think`` do we have some info about the source of the funding ? (I'm thinking about the sell of DEX, SUPERNET and so on to finance all of jl777 crazy cool ideas)

[08-Jan-20 09:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Listings: Last quarter, listed on 4 exchanges.     Marketing:  Last quarter, 4 videos with me,  a few others with ca333 , worldcryptocon and a bunch of Japan events ( with CrisF) Event coordinator partnership.     Our largest viewer demographic the US, has just one person going out , so marketing help is always appreciated .   KMD is not a stock like Apple, it requires active participants.

[08-Jan-20 10:06 PM] Flint#6435
let's not forget that someone received the coins of KMD for free in a large number at the beginning of the launch of the platform and generate passive income using rewards only because the value of the currency is not equal to zero but not equal to zero, it is only because I and many other investors, unlike developers have invested their REAL dollars and bitcoins in the value of the coin, and only thanks to us the coin does not fall below $ 0.4 and is still being traded providing the necessary liquidity to receive its reward, and then the incentives are different flax! This suggests that this reward of 5% is rather a harmful thing for project incentives, because it gives income to the ‚Äúfounding fathers‚Äù and without the introduction of technologies that not only sound beautiful and futuristic, they also work here and now attract the attention of large businesses and large investors who they will say "wow - I have to invest at least a little bit in this because the project is unique and there is no alternative" instead of stronger incentives to make a service with real use today! If tomorrow they stop buying the coin, then it is just delisting

[08-Jan-20 10:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
BTCD holders were contributing to the development of the technology years before KMD existed,  Those BTCD had to be purchased,  they invested just as you had .  Name one service you have paid for to increase the value/utility of KMD.
