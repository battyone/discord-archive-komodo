Hey jl777 (or poly or shossain or decker or CG or alright or others)

Id like to write an article for my upcoming kmd blog about the bitcore integration that is the final article in relation to btc tech.

1)Bitcore enables `addressindex`?

2) Does bitcore enable other features?

3) Is the insight explorer the only explorer that is usable on kmd to take advantage of these features directly from blockchain? (As opposed to explorers that read a mongodb)

4) When was bitcore stuff added to kmd codebase?

Bitcore & explorers is one of my lesser known technologies inside kmd, plz excuse any dumb assumptions

[08-Jan-20 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it has addressindex, spentindex and timestampindex

[08-Jan-20 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
without addressindex, CC would not be performant, in fact many would not be feasible at all

[08-Jan-20 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
insight is the only one i know, but with the addressindex and spentindex rpc it shouldnt be hard to create a GUI to display it. not sure if anybody has

[08-Jan-20 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it was added before CC, so a long time ago

[08-Jan-20 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pesky bug is fixed. now it should maintain constant RAM usage (forever) with constant traffic levels and it shouldnt be crashing. however during the debugging it seemed that it is possible that not all packets for a tag would be in the list for the tag. careful submitting and counting of the DEX_list is needed to see if there is a problem. in the expected usage of just getting the latest packets, hopefully the counts will match.

[08-Jan-20 09:08 AM] Mylo#8306
Thanks!

Ok that‚Äôs interesting about RPC possibilities. I was looking at a python explorer codebase because kmd already uses py cryptocondition test cases.  Perhaps this is a way of making a CC enabled explorer? (With python)

Or is nSPV also an explorer making possibility?

[08-Jan-20 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV would likely be too slow for an explorer, more designed for single client wallets

[08-Jan-20 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, the nSPV talks to nodes with addressindex to get the addressindex data, so having a local node with -addressindex=1 is the way to go

[08-Jan-20 09:11 AM] Mylo#8306
Sweet. Interesting way to achieve result. That‚Äôs further great news about nspv tech.  Cheers

[08-Jan-20 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i try not to follow the "expected" way to achieve results, rather to use deep understanding of the problem and the possible ways to solve it. then to choose the most "efficient". though defining what "efficient" means is not easy, other than "it feels the most efficient" and it takes into account the larger picture of complexity/security

[08-Jan-20 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
also finding the most efficient is an iterative process, as you can see if you are following how -dexp2p is evolving

[08-Jan-20 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
somehow without any mutex locks, it is processing and freeing memory in realtime, without crashes. likely some packets end up in limbo temporarily, but it is all within the design parameters of "as lossless as practical"

[08-Jan-20 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i tried adding mutex locks, but it ended up deadlocking when i didnt expect it to and since it wasnt crashing without them, i pushed forward with the lossy approach

[08-Jan-20 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing prevents a lossless channel to be built on top of the existing messaging layer, so for now this seems the most efficient

[08-Jan-20 09:57 AM] TonyL#3577
That‚Äôs great! will make a test for list tonight and some stress testing

[08-Jan-20 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure to reduce the TXPOWBITS from 12 if you are doing stress test, it can be as low as 1 (or even 0 maybe) and that will save a lot of CPU cycles

[08-Jan-20 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
to get a faster test of purging, you can reduce PURGETIME to 300 so it is a 5 min buffer, instead of one hour

[08-Jan-20 10:12 AM] Mylo#8306
If mutex lock is not needed by this rotating buffer, brilliant. I did something similar with DECT cordless phone display (max characters) in hospitals for nurse call messages in the early 2000s. Obv not p2p complexity, but resource mgmt. it‚Äôs an awesome skill to have as a programmer.

Customizable purge time is useful for further applications.  Great!

[08-Jan-20 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
all the main networking parameters are in #defines. with a bit of work i can make a bunch of command line switches so new networks can be spawned with different attributes, but that is low on priority list as you can just recompile

[08-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
a threeway indexed rotating buffer of hashtables...

[08-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
only system call is calloc/free

[08-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can speed it up a bit more with a more efficient memory allocation, but it seems plenty fast as it is

[08-Jan-20 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
all the code is in komodo_DEX.h, about 1300 lines so far and not much more left to get it feature complete.

[08-Jan-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
often i hear people complain about C saying it takes a lot of code to write stuff in, but not sure how much more compact any other language would be

[08-Jan-20 10:22 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok I‚Äôm not on the tools today, ipad, but can search mutex for info for dev update on this stuff in coming days.  Still working on the main content: bitcoin evolution (utxo, dpow, antara, nspv, bitcore*), smart chain projects* and where they innovate.  * still writing.

[08-Jan-20 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
dont make not having mutex any feature, it can certainly be that i need to add them to fix the orphaned packets bug that tony will find

[08-Jan-20 11:46 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok

[08-Jan-20 01:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
@Mylo 
getsnapshot  which is a unique rpc call in the kmd eco system also uses the -addressindex
There is also the getchaintxstats rpc call which I think comes from that bitcore integration

[08-Jan-20 01:54 PM] CHMEX#0686
getutxoaddress   is also very powerfull it returns all utxos per address which makes the insight so fast without DB

[08-Jan-20 02:33 PM] Mylo#8306
Thanks @CHMEX for details, especially last sentence üëçüôè

[08-Jan-20 03:09 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Any `Dockerfile`s at hand suitable for the DEX branch?

[08-Jan-20 03:11 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Thinking to deploy in on one or two of our servers for easier access.

[08-Jan-20 03:37 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@artemciy_dice  https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/BPMxzVnz5q/ smth like this might do it

[08-Jan-20 03:37 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Just set CMD to what you need and KOMODO_BRANCH

[08-Jan-20 03:42 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
BTW, at this stage I don't expect the AtomicDEX caretakers to use the coin tags. It is more likely that we'll pull the entire stream in, and sort it in an extensible fashion based on the component/system tags present *inside* the datablobs. For instance, if we have a gossip about peer X, this gossip might be relevant to order matching regardless of the coin (like when a KMD/BTC order matching takes into account the presence of a failed or successful DEX/LTC swap).
Maybe there will be uses for tags later, but having them is not our priority right now.
We might also want to share data with the komodod/dexp2p layer by adding datablobs that komodod would recognize and unpack.

[08-Jan-20 03:42 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Thanks, @Sir Seven

[08-Jan-20 03:44 PM] TonyL#3577
It looks like tag filtering precision losing with amount increasing, for 1000 and 10000 it's precise but for 15000 of broadcasts it's a little bit less in list:
```  "tagA": "tag15000",
  "tagB": "",
  "destpub": "",
  "n": 14756
}```
for 100000:
```  "tagA": "tag100000",
  "tagB": "",
  "destpub": "",
  "n": 99355
}```

[08-Jan-20 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i thought as much

[08-Jan-20 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it is 1% level it seems not so bad as i think it only happens on the node that is blasting

[08-Jan-20 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
on other nodes the effect is 10x less

[08-Jan-20 03:54 PM] TonyL#3577
collecting now data for 1 million, just interesting how it'll work

[08-Jan-20 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
now there is a way to quantify this, i will add some code to try to prevent the loss

[08-Jan-20 03:56 PM] TonyL#3577
yep, one more idea for test is above @Sir Seven
broadcast X times with tag_X and check if difference with `n` in `DEX_list` is not more than 1%

[08-Jan-20 03:56 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Already on it. üòÄ

[08-Jan-20 04:05 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Given that caretaker is pulling the data in, and that the nodes join the "broadcast" from the current moment of time (without replay), there's likely no need to keep an entire hour of the data in RAM. I guess we'll be using a much smaller time window, in order not to store the data in memory twice. I'm curious if there are any pointers of what the minimal window could be?

[08-Jan-20 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
120 seconds should work

[08-Jan-20 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe even 60 seconds

[08-Jan-20 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
actually it could be set to 5 seconds

[08-Jan-20 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but likely some bugs when it is so small

[08-Jan-20 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is important, i can get it to work at 5 seconds, but that is probably too small as in some cases there could be lag. so i wouldnt go below 120 seconds

[08-Jan-20 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i am testing at 300 seconds without any issues, dont see why 120 would have any problems

[08-Jan-20 04:09 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
120 sounds fine! ty. and we'll need some of it as a buffer for comfortable caretaker restarts

[08-Jan-20 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there is MAXLAG #define that if you make it bigger, will extend the time a node will send pings to its peers with missing hashes, though on a disconnect/reconnect it might get confused and think a node will have the older messages

{Reactions}
üëç

[08-Jan-20 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but any sort of storage/caching/reliability layer can be added without much trouble to the current messaging layer

[08-Jan-20 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL can you test the missed packets again? i added a mutex in a few spots, hopefully it is a bit better. still seeing some issues on nodes at 100% CPU usage, but i think that is a different issue

[08-Jan-20 04:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, let me check

[08-Jan-20 04:17 PM] TonyL#3577
`cant issue duplicate order modval.993 t.1578500193 460261e2 2768c988c714c777` what these prints means?

[08-Jan-20 04:17 PM] TonyL#3577
looks like sometimes I'm getting it and sometimes not when sending orders in while loop

[08-Jan-20 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
node generated a packet with a collision

[08-Jan-20 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
should be harmless, just skips sending

[08-Jan-20 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i use shorthashes, lowest 32bits and it is possible to get collisions

[08-Jan-20 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
birthday paradox, with large number of shorthashes, odds go up of getting one, so when blasting a million it is a lot more common that would be expected

[08-Jan-20 04:19 PM] TonyL#3577
maybe thats why `n` is less in list

[08-Jan-20 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
true, if you are seeing a lot of them
