I have seen some of the github issues.
The Monero guys are really a bunch of bad people.

Would read again.

Thanks for reposting. Both of those issues persist. Have a feeling it’s related to dynamic loading, but still getting to the bottom of it

[08-Jan-20 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
Also, refactoring the libraries to not compile as plugins seems to fix some things. Still some problems due to historical `blocks` library always linking as dynamic/static in certain libs, but we’ve stopped using that as a historical record. All nodes sync the whole blockchain in our network, without masking PoW hashes

Monero might do well, to do the same.

[08-Jan-20 12:03 PM] Biz#0842
Specifically protocol and p2p libraries are the ones that compile as modules

[08-Jan-20 12:04 PM] Biz#0842
Don’t know if it’s still that way in your code or not... but probably is based on the pushback I got above ^ and keep in mind DB is written in C, as hyc so eloquently pointed out

[08-Jan-20 12:05 PM] Biz#0842
All these things matter very much in certain values that cross libraries

[08-Jan-20 12:07 PM] Biz#0842
And they matter even more when values cross the network...

Won’t work on Linux or Mac, as `euid != uuid`... but that’s only true for things that modify root file system I think?

[08-Jan-20 12:28 PM] Biz#0842
I would probably continue reporting via HackerOne, if i wasn’t being discussed in the context of “banning biz from making contributions” while the same person was also falsifying things I said in a written form

[08-Jan-20 12:28 PM] Biz#0842
But given all of that, I just focus on my own code.
