Also I've realised that summing up the wait times is wrong, the sum doesn't have to be > locktime since waiting actually happens concurrently. But we need to leave some time space for payment spend to be confirmed. So taker can wait for 2/5, maker will wait for 4/5 and even taker payment gets confirmed very close to this 4/5 there's still 1/5 left for payment spend to be confirmed which is fine. It might be not enough for payment spend notarization, but it will still have quite many `raw_confirmations` prior to locktime expiration.","",""
