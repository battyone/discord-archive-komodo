I did just search a little in discord and saw there is some relation between Zaddex and Dune (Tezos fork?) But I know even less about Dune and Tezos lol. 
I suggest trying the Redfox channel for that question (re @johnConnor8: guys anyone know about Zaddex project?)","",""

Total Coin Supply: 1,000,000
DEX receives 50% of all dex fees on AtomicDex API .
This shows all the dex fees collected for every coin. Before payout, these will be traded for KMD and then distributed according to the revenue sharing model. This is the distribution of the dex fees:
50% â€“ DEX
15% â€“ JUMBLR
15% â€“ BOTS
5% â€“ REVS
5% â€“ MGW
10% â€“ Claimed by the GUI developer","",""

"455021680935436290","Gateway#3763","08-Jan-20 10:52 PM","[telegram] <Regnar> Another important thing by doing this is KMD does not fall into the murky waters of security coins by deriving revenue from potential businesses. It still benefits because it is still bought and used to pay out for things like DEX. 
Additionally by keeping the Atomicapi free of requiring KMD, it means other wallets and coin projects can build on it and share liquidity without having to ""become a Komodo coin"" but still benefits KMD by way of trading fees being used to buy KMD.","",""
"455021680935436290","Gateway#3763","08-Jan-20 10:58 PM","[telegram] <Regnar> So think of the alternative, requiring KMD to use the Atomicdex or API, it would keep projects that want to maintain independence and their own coin, from adopting Atomicdex at all.
Development would almost exclusively have to be done by Komodo devs themselves, not just initially, but forever. Keeping it open will help foster a better development ecosystem.
Another example, Binance doesn't require BNB to trade, if they did, they'd probably be replaced by a competitor who didn't","",""
