If you guys have already joined LBRY I have codes for you to collect free LBC. If you have NOT, to get free money, you should join, prove your humanness and ask for my codes. I ask you to use this free LBC to _stake support_ for a week or two to https://lbry.tv/@ARRRchive:d, which means you will not give up your coins but rather give ""thumbs up"" for ARRRchive to be trending on LBRY. I have total of six codes. To join, you may use my referral for me to get 20LBC from the next 3 joiners (after that my referral is full). After that you should ask someone else here to give their referral. We can together make money and make ARRR also trending to give it free exposure. It is a win-win, my friend.

Until that happens, you can encrypt wallet.dat yourself after shutting down zcashd (command line or gui) and then decrypting it yourself before startup, with any of a large number of 3rd party tools. And/or keep it all on an encrypted disk partition in the first place, but performance for that is of course slower and may or may not work well with a blockchain.

Also be aware that any malware, virus or trojan that could steal your wallet.dat file is also perfectly capable of doing keystroke capture for when you enter the password to decrypt it. Sophisticated attackers trolling for bitcoin/altcoin wallets are rumored to have been spotted doing that in the wild, but I don‚Äôt track the latest trends in malware closely, as that‚Äôs my my thing.

So for offline storage, encrypt with your tool of choice, and for a hot wallet you run all the time, just realize that an encrypted wallet is largely a false sense of security.
