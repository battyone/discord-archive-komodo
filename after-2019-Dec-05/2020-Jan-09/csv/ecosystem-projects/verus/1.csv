why have the miners there if you cant use them .. i spent 5h trying to figure it out, could you add a message there saying gpus not suported on the site ? so others dont go trough what i have","",""

If I'm not very mistaken nheqminer is for CPU, so trying to run GPU's on that should take you a lot more than 5 hours to fix. Did you not read the Readme.txt when trying to troubleshoot? It does mention all over how to setup you bat for your CPU. Have a go with the CCMiner CUDA (Nvidia GPU) or the CCMiner OCL (AMD GPU) and you should be sorted üëç","",""
