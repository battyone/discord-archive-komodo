I was responding more to the subtext and actual text of others in here recently  (several days) who are saying now is the time to accumulate (not that the charts show that we are in an accumulation phase).  I was pointing out how the active users who often claim that KMD is a steal at the the current price have been claiming that for 2 frigging years and how BTC has owned them at every single turn for 2 years.  I was also responding to the general haranguing of coingirl.  I agree with little of what she says, but she is critical of KMD which I appreciate and people bag on her, especially the KMD maximalists.  I am not and have never been a KMD maximalist.  I am, however, a salty MF in general.   I am also not saying BTC is a great buy after a 20% pump, but I miiiight still wager that $100 spent on BTC right now will be worth more in 6 months than $100 spent on KMD.  But shiiiiit, i am not buying BTC right now.  Come on man, don't straw man me into the position of a chromosome-challenged individual.","",""
