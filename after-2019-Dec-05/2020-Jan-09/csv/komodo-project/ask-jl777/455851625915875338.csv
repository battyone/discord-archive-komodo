Id like to write an article for my upcoming kmd blog about the bitcore integration that is the final article in relation to btc tech.

1)Bitcore enables `addressindex`?

2) Does bitcore enable other features?

3) Is the insight explorer the only explorer that is usable on kmd to take advantage of these features directly from blockchain? (As opposed to explorers that read a mongodb)

4) When was bitcore stuff added to kmd codebase?

Bitcore & explorers is one of my lesser known technologies inside kmd, plz excuse any dumb assumptions","",""
