If you want to help ARRRchive to get to trending on this platform, you can support the channel or any of the posts by using the support feature (you will still own your coins).
You'll need to get LBC (for example from CoinEx) and send it to your wallet on the platform. Go to settings and ""Enable claim support"". Then go to any post or to the channel and click support and input the amount you want to use.
At this early stage it doesn't need much to get to trending. Support given now will help tremendously in the future as the platform is getting bigger as we speak (as you can see from the LBC price curve during the last month).","",""

Also, there may be competitions in the future to grow the ARRRchive. Anything posted there is free for anyone to use. If you want to use any of the pictures with the original resolution and size, you should download the desktop app. Any and all files from the platform are then yours.","",""

The channel name for now will be Pirate Chain as it is better for the big public. After gaining more followers the channel will change it's name to ARRRchive as requested.","",""

And as you can see, I try to collect pictures and gifs (and why not videos) so that they are easy to browse. But I also include text and links in the description of all posts to get more exposure to the project.
I ask for as beautiful content as possible so that the thumbnails can be the same picture as the content itself. This will help anyone that is browsing through the content to find a pic for their article of tweet, but it also helps with the following on the platform, as beauty attracts.","",""
