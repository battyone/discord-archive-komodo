@ronyi the amount missing is the dex fee
as the liquidity improves, the number of failed swaps should go down considerably

[04-Jan-20 07:31 AM] ronyi#5719
Why we paying dex fee for the nothing? That is not correct and I losing control above my money more than 4hrs and therefore have to pay.

[04-Jan-20 07:42 AM] gcharang#6833
you can read more about the dexfee here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-dex-fee>

tldr: it is necessary for initiating the p2p swap according to the protocol. If there was enough liquidity, there shouldn't be many failed swaps. you won't notice the quantities lost to failed swaps in your total time using AtomicDEX as the fee is aready tiny compared many CEXs. Every successful swap should offset fee lost due to a failed swap

[04-Jan-20 07:59 AM] ronyi#5719
My DEX/KMD swap I think failed again DEX left my wallet (4 conf) and not receive KMD and paid fee again.

[04-Jan-20 08:06 AM] ronyi#5719
Another question: How and when we receive the DEX holder "bonus"?

[04-Jan-20 08:06 AM] gcharang#6833
if the swap fails, you should receive the dex back in about 4 hours
I think there is a maker for DEX that is on a older version of the app, causing swaps to fail
a new version is in development which will ban(locally) pubkeys that cause failed swaps

[04-Jan-20 08:07 AM] gcharang#6833
> How and when we receive the DEX holder "bonus"?

when the fees collected reach a fiat value of $1 million I think
the same KMD address your DEX are held will receive the bonus

[04-Jan-20 08:08 AM] ronyi#5719
So if i holding my DEX in AtomicDEX, i receive the bonus.

[04-Jan-20 08:11 AM] ronyi#5719
if the swap fails, you should receive the dex back (-dex fee) in about 4 hours

[04-Jan-20 08:11 AM] gcharang#6833
> So if i holding my DEX in AtomicDEX, i receive the bonus.
yes, you will receive it in the KMD address that is same as your DEX holding address

I want to update to latest MM2 by compiling myself, but I wonder why I should use this command line (why this date: 2019-10-06???)```rustup install nightly-2019-10-06```

[04-Jan-20 10:52 AM] zatJUM#9924
I don't know anything about rust yet

[04-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Mylo#8306
My guess is testing and api compatibility.  I tried with 2012-12-27 because of clippy and rustfmtpreview failures with the documented versions, but no luck unfortunately.

[04-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Mylo#8306
I‚Äôm waiting for dev team to solve, in no rush, have other work

[04-Jan-20 01:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
Oh! I was thinking it was the version of MM2 to be installed

Wait a bit more, worst case it timeouts.

[04-Jan-20 02:42 PM] dudezmobi#1945
yeah it was a timeout

[04-Jan-20 02:42 PM] Oszy#5734
Then it's 4 hours to get refunded

[04-Jan-20 02:43 PM] dudezmobi#1945

@AndrewYin I don't have access to the seed nodes to check.

[04-Jan-20 07:30 PM] cipi#4502
there are no infos about this uuid on the seed nodes
is it finished or still ongoing?

[04-Jan-20 08:03 PM] AndrewYin#8269
I can start a new one

[04-Jan-20 08:03 PM] AndrewYin#8269

[04-Jan-20 08:36 PM] cipi#4502
saw 2 failed swaps with `maker_gui Makerbot v0.0.1` and `maker_version 2.0.1518_mm2_3ac871d69_Linux`
maker being ZEC... that swaps will not work, version is outdated and can't send ZEC
