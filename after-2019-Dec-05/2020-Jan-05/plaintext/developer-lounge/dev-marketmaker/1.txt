Having the same trouble as others in recent weeks with rust build.  no clippy or rustfmt-preview for the current nightly.

[04-Jan-20 06:20 AM] Mylo#8306

@cipi electrum related?

[04-Jan-20 09:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
And what about <https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/449950331577565194/662344092776398850>?
I still have it with freshly compiled mm2 from `git clone`

[04-Jan-20 09:25 PM] phm87#7395
if there are no zexo electrum servers anymore, maybe you can use a local zexo node. I think that @jorian tried to run mm2 with a local node, I don't remember details but it should be possible

[04-Jan-20 09:27 PM] zatJUM#9924
```curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"electrum\",\"coin\":\"ZEXO\",\"servers\":[{\"url\":\"electrum1.cipig.net:10035\"},{\"url\":\"electrum2.cipig.net:10035\"}],\"mm2\":1}" | jq
{
  "address": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "balance": "yyyyyyyyyyyy",
  "coin": "ZEXO",
  "locked_by_swaps": "0",
  "required_confirmations": 2,
  "result": "success"
}```doesn't mean there *are* electrum servers?

[04-Jan-20 09:29 PM] phm87#7395
I'm surprised, I though that all were down. You can create an order but maybe we should check orderbook before. No ZEXO order as I can see <https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/>

[04-Jan-20 09:31 PM] zatJUM#9924
I've canceled mine as `String("excessive resource usage")`

[04-Jan-20 09:31 PM] zatJUM#9924
Do you want me to put it back?

[04-Jan-20 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know, I have no interest in zexo sorry but I have loads of commod to sell

[04-Jan-20 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
One day, I'll open a museum

[04-Jan-20 09:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
I have no interest in commod either üòâ

[04-Jan-20 09:34 PM] zatJUM#9924
But if the one's who can create several orders do it, it makes some activity on mm2

[04-Jan-20 09:37 PM] cipi#4502
@zatJUM what mm2 are you using? any special stuff that queries electrums like crazy?

[04-Jan-20 09:39 PM] cipi#4502
can you send me your IP, so i can look what the electrums are telling?

[04-Jan-20 09:39 PM] cipi#4502
and please use all 3 electrums, not just 2, so the load is spread

[04-Jan-20 09:44 PM] cipi#4502
have you set `tx_history` to `true`somewhere? (coins-file or electrum/enable-call)

[04-Jan-20 09:46 PM] cipi#4502
and yes, ZEXO electrums are still up

[04-Jan-20 10:03 PM] cipi#4502
i looked for the string `excessive resource usage` in the electrumx code and can't find it... so the error ddoes not come from the electrums... also not in the mm2 code... no idea where the error comes from

[04-Jan-20 10:05 PM] phm87#7395
sometimes I have to grep the whole disk to find if there is a hidden log (log of a firewall or something else)

[04-Jan-20 10:11 PM] cipi#4502
found it... `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/aiorpcx/session.py` a module the electrumx server is using

[04-Jan-20 10:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
@cipi fresh compiled one from `git clone` and only 5 coins activated via electrum, 3 active orders only.
I will use 3 servers, sorry!
No tx_history set.

[04-Jan-20 10:14 PM] cipi#4502
hmmm... so nothing unusual... will look into this https://github.com/kyuupichan/aiorpcX stuff, maybe i can update it
i see there is a slightly newer version

[04-Jan-20 10:19 PM] cipi#4502
the changelog does not look promising... i think i know though what the problem might be... aiorpc has problems with many connection-requests... i think the above "excessive resource usage" is actually from KMD electrums, not ZEXO
