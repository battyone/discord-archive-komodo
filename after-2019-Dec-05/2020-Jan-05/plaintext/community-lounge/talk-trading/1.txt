Until now, cryptocurrencies have been additions, rather than substitutes, to the global inventory of money. Over the next decade, this may change. Read more in the latest edition of #dbkonzept

@Lanii all good dude. I know you weren't bragging and obviously you don't get every call right, none of us do, that's trading. I just know how frustrating it can be with so many who hate on TA but refuse to learn.

I also hope people take note of point 32 in the link from  @PTYX above. They tried but can't seem to get rid of cash ü§î

From ptyx link ```a third of people in developed 
countries consider cash their favourite payment 
method and more than half believe cash will 
always be around. Indeed, in Germany, nearly 60 
per cent of in-store purchases are paid in cash 
and Germans hold ‚Ç¨52 in cash on average ‚Äì the 
highest rate amongst advanced economies. 
Furthermore, the average German plans to use 
even more cash over the coming six months.
Overall, people pay cash because they 
find their¬†spending easier to monitor, the 
transaction fast and convenient, they have no 
trouble with acceptance, and their purchases 
remain¬†anonymous.```

[04-Jan-20 06:02 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I'd wait to make sure that's not a bear flag on the daily or it's going back to $90

See the bearish div on RSI? I'd be careful

[04-Jan-20 06:23 PM] Markus#5464

@Cryptoon And how many times has it gone up just to go all the way back down again? I'll hold my excitement until it's back at $1 and stays there

[04-Jan-20 08:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I was being sarcastic

[04-Jan-20 08:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ive been here long enough that it can all change rather quickly üòÉ

[04-Jan-20 08:23 PM] Bitfinger#6245
This time it's different üòâ

I can see us retesting 52c, but I think the 40's are done

[04-Jan-20 08:56 PM] Markus#5464
no close on 4h above 7,87k = still bearish to me
