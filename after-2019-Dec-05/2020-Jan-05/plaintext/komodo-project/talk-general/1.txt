How did this guy get hold of hardware exactly? Did he break into your office  @dukeleto?

[04-Jan-20 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
he was on their team, was send android phones is what i heard

[04-Jan-20 05:55 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Ok thanks  @jl777c, I can understand crypto is easy to scam, but hardware not so much which is why I asked.

[04-Jan-20 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Not sure how one "stole" that which was *given*

[04-Jan-20 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is old enough to remember when words had actual meanings and value (and 'literally' wasn't its own antonym)_

[04-Jan-20 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
if you loan someone something and they dont return it, it seems wrong

[04-Jan-20 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you dont feel that is wrong and that possession is all that matters, but clearly the people that loaned him the phones feel wronged

[04-Jan-20 06:29 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
According to HUSH discord the phones were not given, loaned, borrowed... Privatoshi was a developer, who should work on the so called ˝hushdroid˝ phone. It looks like he took his chance to run away with hardware...

[04-Jan-20 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it seems wrong`
Didn't say it wasn't wrong, just that it wasn't "stolen".

[04-Jan-20 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are saying if you work for a project and get computers to work on and dont return them, its not stealing? what do you call it?

[04-Jan-20 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if it was an official company and you dont return company property, that isnt called stealing?

[04-Jan-20 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what do you call it?`
larceny

[04-Jan-20 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you do realize the definition of larceny?
```larceny
noun [ C or U ]   LAW specialized UK 
 / ˈLɑː.s ə n.i / US  / ˈLɑːr.s ə n.i /
 
stealing , especially (in the US) the crime of taking something that does not belong to you, without illegally entering a building to do so```

[04-Jan-20 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it has to do with the erosion of language
Once upon a time, me taking something from you without your permission and me keeping something you gave me after you've rescinded permission were distinctly different

Who cares, it’s sad it happened

Whatever the semantics

[04-Jan-20 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it’s sad it happened`
on that much we all agree

genie is a scammer because I gave him money to buy an android and he didn't

[04-Jan-20 08:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
Mainly  Hush wanted to warn the KMD community to prevent any other people or projects from dealing with the person. He had done good work previously and sent back phones after being correctly setup.

[04-Jan-20 08:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
Some people would rather nitpick on edge cases than realize we are trying to help y'all. The good people understand

@dukeleto how much hardware are you talking about?

[04-Jan-20 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`genie is a scammer because I gave him money to buy an android and he didn't`
That I never use it as a non-phone doesn't mean I don't have one

[04-Jan-20 08:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
2 or 3 pixel 3's (not sure how many yet), just under $1000 at maximum. The hilarious thing is I was giving him one of these 3 phones, as payment for setting things up and documenting things. So he stole his own gift, which I am sure will curse his phone by Gremlins. In the grand scheme, it's a small loss. We could have just said nothing, but I wanted to warn KMD community

[04-Jan-20 08:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am actually glad nobody trusted the phones he setup, that would have been worse. So he helped us, in my mind

[04-Jan-20 08:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
Thanks Privatoshi!

[04-Jan-20 08:26 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
Thanks Privatoshi? No. If he were had more of patiance, he could scam people for much more. Only we came throught with less damage as we could/should.

[04-Jan-20 09:24 PM] richardt#2807
The problem is you guys trusted an anonymous guy who called himself "Privatoshi"

[04-Jan-20 09:26 PM] phm87#7395
it can be worse if scammer use a fake identity (I remember that kmd team was fooled about IBM sth so it can happen with anybody)

[04-Jan-20 09:28 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
@richardt True. As we could trust ananoimous guy called richard or jl777. At one point you must take some risk.

[04-Jan-20 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
trust on the interwebz is a funny thing

[04-Jan-20 09:46 PM] AndrewYin#8269
:)

[04-Jan-20 10:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@richardt what you are not understanding is that he was a capable android person, and did a lot of good work up to a point. He just chose to steal those devices because he was not happy with his pay. So your description isn't quite right. More like "trusted a capable employee and they ended up stealing from you". It's a much different situation that every biz/operation must deal with

[04-Jan-20 10:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
This was not social engineering. This was a contractor doing contract work on devices, going rogue, stealing the current devices they had access to. I can see why people might be confused, I did not explain it well.
