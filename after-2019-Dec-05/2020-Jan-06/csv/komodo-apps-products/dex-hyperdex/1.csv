BarterDEX retired. AtomicDEX API is the replacement.

AtomicDEX app is the app that uses the api.
HyperDEX is an app that originally worked on BarterDEX network & is currently being upgraded to work on the new atomicdex api","",""

Could always get fancier in the future with ability to list trades to auto update based on % over / under exchange prices","",""

1. Core Dev, helping out with the hyperDEX code base, must have js exp and can understand the code located at https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/
2. QA, helping out to test the hyperDEX code base, have had experience with writing up user stories and doing QA 
3. Support, willing to understand how hyperDEX works and can provide support to users. Would be great to understand the various mm2.0 steps to complete a dex transaction.
4. Marketers, helping to spread the word on social media and to help market hyperDEX in general.

Now i understand that since these are not paid positions, this will only be a viable if we can get enough people that can dedicate enough time to push this forward. Now this could all be a futile effort since the team is building their down Desktop app but the other alternative is to let hyperDEX die. I am hopeful there are still others in the community that would like to help, if that is something that you would like to do, please DM me.","",""
