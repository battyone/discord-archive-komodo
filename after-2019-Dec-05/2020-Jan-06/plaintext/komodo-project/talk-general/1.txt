No halving in komodo

Rogue KMD agents making off with hundreds of dollars of equipment... sounds almost like a Bond film.  There was probably champagne and lots of distracting cleavage involved in this epic heist.  Perhaps Interpol will pause its search for Carmen San Diego and focus their nearly infinite resources on finding Privatoshi.  God speed, detectives!

Blockchain‚Äôs Occam problem
Blockchain has yet to become the game-changer some expected. Blockchain development may well hinge on applying the technology only when it is the simplest solution available.

@PHBA2061 is that real?  what year is block 7,777,777?

[05-Jan-20 02:21 PM] PHBA2061#2530
we are currently at block 1,692,281 . Each kmd block takes 60-66 secs to mine, I'll let you do the maths, but it's about in ~11 years & 6 months
