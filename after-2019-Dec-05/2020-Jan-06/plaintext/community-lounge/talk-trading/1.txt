TA ruined crypto. I remember the days when people hodl and weren't satisfied until price went 2-3x. Nowadays price goes up 10% and we're expecting a reversal üòÑ

@richardt thats just how the market works dude

@richardt üòÇ Imagine buying every 10% reversal for 2 years straight, ouuf. Should just zoom out and talk about reversals when things are happening on  a weekly timeframe at least and that should be far more then a 10% move to the upside. My advice is ignoring all trendline break outs. We have had these multiple times over all timeframes these last 2 years.

[05-Jan-20 03:24 AM] Lanii#8302
Also if crypto really is worth something then you are going to see 2-3x and more moves again. We are simply in a bear market untill proven otherwise

[05-Jan-20 03:24 AM] Lanii#8302
TA hasn't ruined anything, just different times now.

[05-Jan-20 03:34 AM] richardt#2807
It did. Crypto was not meant to be traded like stocks. If I'm not mistaken, it was meant to actually be used...

[05-Jan-20 03:37 AM] richardt#2807
So far, usage is scarce.

[05-Jan-20 03:38 AM] richardt#2807
Pretty sad to see what it's become

@richardt I bet corn and oil was not meant to be traded either but they do. Anything of value that goes up and down will be traded, its not something you can escape wether you like or not.

Pretty sure derivatives markets and stable coins ruined crypto more than TA

[05-Jan-20 12:08 PM] Markus#5464
i was before trading alts on btc pairs but its so unreliable, u can have a great setup and then btc pumps or dumps and ur trade setup got fucked up, trading them against usd is more reliable cause if btc pumps most likely u gain in usd aswell

[05-Jan-20 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
another thing that is pretty annoying are those shitty CME gaps, if btc dumps or pumps on weekend u will see it return to those prices later on to fill the gaps that were created on the CME chart

[05-Jan-20 02:53 PM] richardt#2807
Perhaps you guys are right. Maybe the problem is with crypto itself. It was meant to be used, but so far, not a whole lot is actually useful so people just trade it back and forth instead

Trump and Congress critters removed like to like trading, and demanded taxes on all trades,  and added all kinds of KYC/AML laws. This definitely helped deflate altcoin trades. And in their own words, BTC future contracts helped pop the bubble. https://www.sgtreport.com/2019/11/trump-administration-launched-bitcoin-futures-to-manipulate-price-lower-former-cftc-chair/

Lets hope for this little correction to be a small triangle for a bullish impulse formation

[05-Jan-20 03:38 PM] Markus#5464
@richardt right, most of crypto are just being traded and very little usecase

[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] KTnoc#4131
crypto coins / projects should only be seen as infrastructure providers, differentiating emselves with technical properties, and tools (SDK ?), to allow companies to build on top of it. "Revolution" won't come from coins, or chains, but how plugged devs will use and create from tools provided by projects

KMD holding pretty well at these levels, usually we would be back at 7K sats after that spike to 8K last night.

[05-Jan-20 07:19 PM] tolken#2655
anything goes

[05-Jan-20 07:20 PM] tolken#2655
my orders didn‚Äôt fill in the 6k zone, so someone must still like Kmd

[05-Jan-20 07:35 PM] Markus#5464
well 6.8k ish kinda was the last stop for kmd to prove itself, if we would go below 6.8k then we would of seen new lows

[05-Jan-20 07:35 PM] Markus#5464
unless we would of made a double bottom also possible

[05-Jan-20 08:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Triangle at hourly chart seems to be near a resolution point. Hope it breaks upward

[05-Jan-20 08:45 PM] Lanii#8302
@siu - Chainmakers Since you are looking at 1h, even if it was to break up it would be a small pump ;p

[05-Jan-20 08:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not looking for a big pump now, in looking for a bullish outcome to get a impulsive wave from the bottom.

[05-Jan-20 08:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Once we get an impulsive wave formation, we can attest the validity of this move up.

[05-Jan-20 09:10 PM] Lanii#8302
@siu - Chainmakers Gotcha üëç

[05-Jan-20 09:11 PM] Lanii#8302
However if we keep pumping here, we already had our impulsive move to the upside and now also tested it aswell.
