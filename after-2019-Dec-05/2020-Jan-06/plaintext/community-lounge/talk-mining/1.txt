all, I speak on behalf of a large mining pool, may I talk to any miner or team member?

[05-Jan-20 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there are always miners about

[05-Jan-20 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
just say what's up and someone will reply

[05-Jan-20 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@pal

[05-Jan-20 11:14 AM] pal#3989
Well, one of the largest pools will list KMD in a few days, ca333 knows about it, we spoke on wechat, we want to coordinate

[05-Jan-20 11:18 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
coordinate what?

[05-Jan-20 11:25 AM] pal#3989
hash power on that pool when launched

[05-Jan-20 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's been my experience that miners tend to use a set-it-and-forget-it mentality

[05-Jan-20 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I wish you luck, but I'm not sure that you'll get much "out of the gate" momentum without some announced "advantage" over existing pools

[05-Jan-20 11:29 AM] pal#3989
Well, there will be announced advantage

[05-Jan-20 11:30 AM] pal#3989
we are looking for a place where the advantage announcement could reach as many KMD miners as possible

[05-Jan-20 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
here, twitter, and reddit would be my suggestions

[05-Jan-20 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
beyond that, random equihash miner discords, maybe

[05-Jan-20 11:34 AM] pal#3989
well, that is what I am looking for, a partner that can help me to diffuse into such channels

[05-Jan-20 04:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Share it with me or another team member when it gets announced and we can retweet/share etc.

[05-Jan-20 05:05 PM] Tom.T#6920
As the announcement is made on such of social media, more and more miner will be attracted.
