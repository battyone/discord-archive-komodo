So he is one of the Bytecoin sockpuppets that constantly attack Blur because his tech is far superior?
Shame!

The world deserves to know more about the scammy practices!

I don’t have anything against cryptozoidberg

His code doesn’t have a Monero-ey feel to it

[05-Jan-20 09:40 PM] Biz#0842
I’ve read quite a bit of his work

It’s not all the guys at Monero I dislike. Just a couple/few

Zano is definitely pushing the tech forward from what I’ve seen @Jobi

Kinda view them like I view Beam. Similar degrees of novel code
