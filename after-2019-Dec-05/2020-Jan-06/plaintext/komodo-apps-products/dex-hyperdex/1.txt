what is the difference between hyperdex and atomicdex? I thought AtomicDex replaced hypderdex (the old barterdex?) but I think i'm wrong. Can anyone enlighten me?

Network, p2p orderbook and order matching layer.
BarterDEX retired. AtomicDEX API is the replacement.

AtomicDEX app is the app that uses the api.
HyperDEX is an app that originally worked on BarterDEX network & is currently being upgraded to work on the new atomicdex api

Hehe

I'm currently using AtomicDex app on phone along with that oracle orderbook csv download & a custom excel sheet that pulls prices from coingecko api, so i guess hypderdex will simplify all of that quite a bit

What do you wanna see on a screen?

I‚Äôll put up orderbook on web today or tomorrow if I can get mm2 to compile

would be nice to see a list of trades offered, sortable by price and other fields. Ability to filter for specific pairs? Could always get fancier in the future with ability to list trades to auto update based on % over / under exchange prices

Hyperdex discussions üôèüèºüëÜ

hyperDEX is transitioning into a community project. We are looking for people to volunteer for the following positions:

1. Core Dev, helping out with the hyperDEX code base, must have js exp and can understand the code located at https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/
2. QA, helping out to test the hyperDEX code base, have had experience with writing up user stories and doing QA 
3. Support, willing to understand how hyperDEX works and can provide support to users. Would be great to understand the various mm2.0 steps to complete a dex transaction.
4. Marketers, helping to spread the word on social media and to help market hyperDEX in general.

Now i understand that since these are not paid positions, this will only be a viable if we can get enough people that can dedicate enough time to push this forward. Now this could all be a futile effort since the team is building their down Desktop app but the other alternative is to let hyperDEX die. I am hopeful there are still others in the community that would like to help, if that is something that you would like to do, please DM me.
