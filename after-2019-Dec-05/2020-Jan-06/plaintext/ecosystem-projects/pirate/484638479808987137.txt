@balajis @VitalikButerin @lopp @ljxie @dwr In the pre-privacy days of the web, users broadcast unencrypted data to whoever was listening. Then HTTPS happened.

@zooko and @jswihart argue that we're in a similar pre-privacy era of blockchains. And now Zcash is happening. ht...

Great article about z-transactions. The pre-encryption internet (http) as an allegory for the pre-encryption blockchains. z-tx resemble the next evolutionary step, https. The winner of the FIRST "crypto war" was encryption üòé.
Kudos, @zooko! $ZEC $ARRR

[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> zcash deserve a lot of credit for paving the way but it is time for :pirate_p: now to work itself at the top of this discussion.
thank you for all your efforts @JiuCrypto. your work is amazing :pirate: :pirate: :pirate:

[dscrd-prt] <Hember> There are already 58 followers to ARRRchive on LBRY.

[05-Jan-20 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I'm aiming to 500 followers by the end of the month. Thant would make ARRRchive rank60 channel (on today's stats).

[05-Jan-20 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> Just signed up and followed, #59

[05-Jan-20 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Yeah, I noticed.

[05-Jan-20 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> The channel has now 1013.77 LBC staked support.

[05-Jan-20 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> That will already cause it to be seen more often. I hope as the content accumulates the support gets bigger too. I've seen many channels with bigger support and less content. I think it is good to offer good amount of content when the views on the channel start to go up.

[05-Jan-20 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> If any of you have proved your humanness, I suggest you to watch at least one pic/vid a day. That will give you rewards. And I think the ath of LBC has been 1,2 dollars. I once got a 100 reward. But that is the biggest there is and that almost never happens. Still thinking about it, I doesn't cost me anything, and one day that one view may be worth 120 dollars üòÑ

[dscrd-prt] <Hember> (Good moment for anyone to buy LBC now. Price came down quite fast. Possibility to give support for a while and then cash out some gains. If goes down to 0.0000035000, I'll be buying a bunch.. Or I have a buy offer ready there. That'll go to support.)

[05-Jan-20 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jan-20 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763

(as I read it) basically it's nothing more than forcing extra outputs to increase the resources required to track data
it has its benefits, but I'm not sure if it's any better than (and afaik it's weaker than) deadending 1 sat for every tx

Hilarious to hear expert "pirates" talk about Sietch that don't even know how to calculate an anonset or what a nullifier is, who have 0 commits into any kind of important code that is relevant to having a valuable opinion. And yes, I have banned CG from many places because he is a huge asshole with small technical output. Not worth the hassle. And he surely does not grasp what he speaks of above
