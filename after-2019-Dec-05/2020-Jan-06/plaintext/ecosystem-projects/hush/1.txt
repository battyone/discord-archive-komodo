[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> @dukeleto hey man... May I ask why I got blocked on your Twitter? I am a fan of your work and was surprised to see it. Did I say something offensive?

[05-Jan-20 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiuCrypto i have a general policy to mute/block twitter accounts with more than 10K followers because usually they are purchased "influencer accounts" with no idea what they are talking about, or just posting self-serving info. You hit both categories

[05-Jan-20 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But, in the interest of diplomacy, and so you can see my content, I changed you to Muted

[05-Jan-20 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> While people constantly shill online about "anonsets" and "the most privacy", I am actually writing code that Does The Thing

[05-Jan-20 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so I mute and block freely on twitter, it's the only way to make it usable

[05-Jan-20 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I block/mute hundreds of accounts, don't worry, it wasn't personal, just business.

[05-Jan-20 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules thanks, no worries about donations

[05-Jan-20 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiuCrypto if you truly want to be the first "influencer" to talk about something new, tell people about Sietch: https://github.com/myhush/sietch

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiuCrypto ask Pirate what they are doing in response to these metadata attacks

[05-Jan-20 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiuCrypto ask them how is their work on this Zcash metadata bug that has been open for over a year: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3606

[05-Jan-20 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sietch is drastic new tech to fight a new metadata war

[05-Jan-20 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nobody thought it was needed, but it is

[05-Jan-20 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Plain Zcash Protocol is insecure.

[05-Jan-20 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Any coin can choose to add Sietch or something like it, if they don't, they have very little privacy, if any.

[05-Jan-20 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Amazingly, within a few days of me announcing Sietch (after being in the works for months), @denio implemented it in SDL! I had thought SDL could use the Sietch within hushd, but actually it uses raw xtns and needed it's own. Epic thanks to @denio !! If you want to thank somebody for helping the privacy of everybody, it's him. It's still doing final testing, but the next SDL with feature Sietch goodness

[05-Jan-20 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I can't say enough good things about @denio and how much help he has provided as well as doing cool stuff completely on his own.

[05-Jan-20 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> @dukeleto thanks for clarification. Also for clarifucation: my twitter bio explicitly says "not an influencer" as I despise 99% of them and don't want to belong to that category üòÅ

[05-Jan-20 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> @dukeleto also thanks for the technical update and unblocking. It would be a shame to miss out o future developments

[05-Jan-20 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> I am not a cultist of any single coin btw

[05-Jan-20 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> Saying this because you mentioned pirate

[05-Jan-20 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> Yes, I love the project

[05-Jan-20 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> But that doesn't mean I can't respect and hold others as well

[05-Jan-20 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> Does the metadata leak result from z-TX THEMSELVES? Or is it indirectly because of the transparent tx of the ecosystem?

[05-Jan-20 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @JiuCrypto unfurtionally the Meta Data leak is for every Project who use zaddr relevant. In short: every z-transaction can be linked with Metadata, that's why Hush use now Sietch to make it alot harder to do that. Amazing work by @dukeleto

[05-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> @denio that implies it is also affecting z-z only projects?

[05-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> But since Zcash coorperate with analyst companies, I guess they will not try to prevent  the leak

[05-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Z-z more then optional

[05-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> ok

[05-Jan-20 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> It's all about linking data for analyst company's... And Hush makes that now much harder to do that

[05-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> Sounds about right. Has there been any statement by ZCash or ECC on the issues?

[05-Jan-20 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Like I said, Zec works together with such companies (if I remember correct they said this on Twitter). So I don't expect a statement from them. The Github issue Duke posted is a good start point for more research on that in  Zcash world

[05-Jan-20 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> There are more Infos about the so called "ITM Attac" I guess. #deanon is also a good research start point

[05-Jan-20 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiuCrypto> @denio thanks for the info

[05-Jan-20 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just catching up here

[05-Jan-20 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiuCrypto the ITM attack is on z2z transactions themselves

[05-Jan-20 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> any other metadata from taddrs just makes it much worse

[05-Jan-20 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiuCrypto I helped create Pirate, I have more code into Pirate than just about anybody, except jl777. I have respect for them, they were the first z2z coin. Also, we must move forward and cannot sit on our laurels in privacy coin world. Every day presents new attacks, and the ITM attack is probably the worse attack against Zcash Protocol yet known

[05-Jan-20 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ITM came up with it, so the specific attack he described we dubbed "the ITM metadata attack". Yes, naming things is hard.

[05-Jan-20 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Now, in working with him, we realize the attack is an entire new class of attacks and I dubbed that entire new class of attacks "Metaverse metadata attacks"

[05-Jan-20 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> none of it has been publicly described much, because I wanted to have Hush 3.3.0 out with mitigations first üôÇ

[05-Jan-20 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So Hush is the first and currently only coin with protection against these metadata attacks. I assume smart zcash forks will adopt Sietch or something like it, or continue to not care about their anonsets

[05-Jan-20 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, Hush can now measure it's anonset in real-time

[05-Jan-20 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the first Zcash coin to do that as well

[05-Jan-20 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am seeing some issues with our explorer, remember we have this nice one too: https://hush3.komodod.com/

[05-Jan-20 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Here is an example of a Sietch transaction with 8 zouts: https://explorer.myhush.org/tx/86e16623cb1e50830c634c1edff3c6ef1ce15588c994fcfe7210490f299b58a4

[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Hush starting 2020 with a big bang. Nice to read these updates and am awaiting more public disclosure about the metadata attacks. Thank you Duke and denio and anyone esle involved for this gigantic step forward.

[05-Jan-20 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Duke, a lot of respect to you for coding for your legacy and morals. It's more and more clear as each month passes. Seriously, thank you. You can bring forth privacy tools/solutions that few can even dream of.

[05-Jan-20 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eddy O thanks, that means a lot to me!

[05-Jan-20 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jan-20 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We can calculate our anonset in real-time, let's see how long it takes for them to figure it out

[05-Jan-20 11:08 PM] phm87#7395
@dukeleto is it really complicated to copy paste your getchaintxstats code and -zindex into komodo (if not yet there) to execute these rpc calls frequently and display some fancy charts with these numbers on other coins with ztx ?

[05-Jan-20 11:09 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry to ask but how hard is it to add it into zcash itself for the fun ?
