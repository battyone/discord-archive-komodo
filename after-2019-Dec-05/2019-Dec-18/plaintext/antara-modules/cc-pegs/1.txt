@Mihailo i "fixed" the adaptivepow, but i dont think it was a bug exactly. my guess is that you were mining with not so many cores, maybe even just 1. that would make the variance very high and in that case it would make the diff all the way to mindiff, which can be mined pretty fast, even with one core. which makes it look like a big hashrate increase.
so, what i did was make new adaptivepow=N values. using values of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 you can have different levels of sensitivity. the more normal miners you have, the smaller the number can be. so without many miners, then adaptivepow=7 might make sense, but the higher the number the less responsive it will be to hashrate increases.

for a chain without block rewards, that probably isnt a big concern, so i would make a chain with adaptivepow=6 or 7

[17-Dec-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
unfortunately it is a hardforking change, so you will need a new chain to change the adaptivepow= value

oh, wait, i need to fix the commit

[17-Dec-19 02:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, great. Yes I was mining with 1 or 2 cores and only one node to avoid forks in beginning of the chain.

[17-Dec-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
ok fixed

[17-Dec-19 02:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
It will be in FSM?

[17-Dec-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
its there

mine on just one node, with max cores you can without disrupting other things

[17-Dec-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
one node using N cores wont contribute to forking, as it all happens in one node

[17-Dec-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
using adaptivepow=6 should work much smoother (10x) with 6+ cores

[17-Dec-19 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i am still testing on the last chain to make sure my theory is correct. it just was so slow, i went ahead and fixed the problem before i got all the timing results

[17-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
My nodes are with 2 cores so cannot mine with much more

[17-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
But I will mine locally on my machine

[17-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
With 8 cores
