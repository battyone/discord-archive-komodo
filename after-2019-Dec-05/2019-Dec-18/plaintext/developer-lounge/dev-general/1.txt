if you think about it like this it is easier to grok.
1st node is seed node.
2nd node is mining node, use -addnode=ip.of.node.1
3rd node, same
nth node, same

When you make on a single node smart chain, it is the same.  The only difference is -addnode=127.0.0.1 for 2nd node.  3rd node to nth node will use -addnode=external.ip.node.1

Because 1st two nodes are on same host.

@Regnar no deep information provided

@pandaanu73 I don't understand what you mean? I suggested if you were looking to start a business or build something that people's money would rely on working perfectly, it's better to not experiment and to work with those who have a lot of experience in working with Komodo smart chains and code base. If you are just exploring the docs and testing stuff out and building little stuff for fun (like me) then nbd, ask questions and expect to break things.

I heard someone say once "The best docs are the source code. You just have to learn how to read it." If you want deep information, you need to go deep.
