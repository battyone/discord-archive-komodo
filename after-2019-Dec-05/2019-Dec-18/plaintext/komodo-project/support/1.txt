Can you stake KMD in the Agama wallet, or can it only be done in QT?

[17-Dec-19 07:13 AM] Oszy#5734
KMD is not staked. You don't need to run a wallet to accumulate the rewards. 
Claiming is working in Agama native / lite mode, and any other wallet not just in Qt.

If I try to use Ocean I'm getting similar error

[17-Dec-19 07:47 PM] userpike#6501
please help

[17-Dec-19 07:50 PM] userpike#6501
Also if I try to open Verus in Agama in lite mode it says it can't connect to SPV server. I tried to switch it in settings and it won't connect to either of the 2 that is shown in the list

IF it matters I always use Komodo in native mode

[17-Dec-19 07:57 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, my suggestion is to backup your wallet.dat files
then delete the blockchain data and either sync from scratch or use a bootstrap

[17-Dec-19 07:57 PM] gcharang#6833
and make sure you are using the latest ocean qt wallet

[17-Dec-19 07:58 PM] userpike#6501
Did that already twice. I DLed the Ocean from Komodo site

[17-Dec-19 07:58 PM] userpike#6501
it was working a few days ago..

[17-Dec-19 07:58 PM] userpike#6501
well Agama anyway

[17-Dec-19 07:58 PM] gcharang#6833

using multiple versions of different wallets for native mode has a high chance of corrupting your local data

[17-Dec-19 08:00 PM] userpike#6501
I will DL that version of Ocean and see what happens. but i really like the Verus-Agama

[17-Dec-19 08:01 PM] gcharang#6833
the verus agama is very good for lite mode but, I find the ocean wallet works well for native mode

even if you prefer the agama wallet for native mode, delete the blockchain data and use the latest agama version to sync

[17-Dec-19 08:02 PM] userpike#6501
ok I'll give it a try. thanks for the assistance

Noobie here from THC. Can someone please point me in the right direction for instructions on how to update the komodo binaries? I went to Github and saw the komodo 0.5.0 obsidon dragon file, downloaded it, but have no clue what to do from there. I have komodo on a Linux machine, and I also have a windows 7 machine. I don't use the komodo, but needed to start it so I could then run THC on an associated chain, and it all  works fine, but now I am told I have to upgrade komodo before the THC fork Dec 20. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thx.

[17-Dec-19 09:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Just:
1) replace current komodod binary you have with binary from 0.5.0 release archive
restart THC chain:
2) stop THC chain (`./komodo-cli -ac_name=THC stop`)
3) start THC chain with new binary 
`./komodod -ac_name=THC -ac_supply=251253103 -ac_reward=360000000,300000000,240000000,180000000,150000000,90000000,0 -ac_staked=100 -ac_eras=7 -ac_end=500001,1000001,1500001,2000001,2500001,4500001,0 -ac_perc=233333333 -ac_cc=2 -ac_ccenable=229,236,240 -ac_script=2ea22c8020987fad30df055db6fd922c3a57e55d76601229ed3da3b31340112e773df3d0d28103120c008203000401ccb8 -ac_founders=150 -ac_cbmaturity=1 -ac_sapling=1 -addnode=157.230.45.184 -addnode=165.22.52.123 -earlytxid=7e4a76259e99c9379551389e9f757fc5f46c33ae922a8644dc2b187af2a6adc1 &`

Glad to help üëç  Note that on Windows machine you'll need to orient slashes different (`.\komodo-cli` and `.\komodod`)

[17-Dec-19 09:41 PM] gregmcgolf#5997
Great, good point

[17-Dec-19 10:29 PM] gregmcgolf#5997
Ok, this may sound basic, but can't figure out how to replace "komodod binary" and don't know what that file(s) is/are or where to put them? I thought I did it correctly, renamed the komodo folder to komodo old, then put all the new extracted files in a new komodo folder, restarted the daemon and it seeemed to work, but then when I run getinfo, it says the kmd version is 0.4.0a so obviously it is still using the old data

[17-Dec-19 11:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you sure that starting the daemon from not old folder? Do you see `0.4.0a` after update on both Linux and Windows?
