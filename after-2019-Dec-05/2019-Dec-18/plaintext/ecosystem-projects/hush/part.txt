[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They're market makers will be having as much influence, as Bitmex's counter trading desk

[17-Dec-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Market making works both ways

[17-Dec-19 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They can work together to move the price around.

[17-Dec-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If they provide liquidity, they have a huge influence, on what they can do.

[17-Dec-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> it's not like they are constantly acitve

[17-Dec-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> they use the bots so you can always enter or exit a trade

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mixic my russian is quite bad, but it looks like a nice extensive history of the project, with lots of screenshots and links and stuff. That is what we need, to show people we have been around a long time

[17-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush was around before most other coins, and we are still here

[17-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i need to update both whitepapers, and then we can start getting serious about translating them

[17-Dec-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have a Spanish translation of both papers already, that is amazing

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mixic another small thing, the atomicdex links. those are "tracking" links from KMD emails, we probably should give the direct links. You are confusing their metrics, it will show up as all the link clicks via your webpage will show up to KMD as coming from their email üòÖ

[17-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> awesome!

[17-Dec-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mixic how can I, and the Hush community, be more welcoming to non-English speakers, such as people who speak Russian and other languages? I am always taking advice on how to make Hush more accessible

[17-Dec-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the new SDA supports RUB and about 20 currencies, that should help

[17-Dec-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I am working on supporting those same currencies in :SD: in the `market` branch

[17-Dec-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SDL supports about a dozen currencies, too. and SD, SDL, SDA all support Russian, iirc. Our website is not translated to Russian, tho

[17-Dec-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mixic> it's the right thing to do. Power must be present everywhere. Dissemination of information is a great power, and it must be in different languages

[17-Dec-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are, at the core, a decentralized P2P network, and so we must decentralize our users and so, we must support as many spoken languages as we can

[17-Dec-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mixic> of course

[17-Dec-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is meant for all, and those with the least power (most oppression) have the most to gain from Hush tech

[17-Dec-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mixic> added information about New DragonHead Full Node. Great product. It needs to be more widely disseminated
