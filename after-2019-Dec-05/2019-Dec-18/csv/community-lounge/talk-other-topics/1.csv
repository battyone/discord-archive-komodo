1. Robustness against malicious hacking of bitcoin systems.

2. Resisting vitality despite near-cursive criticism from elites and media.

3. Maintaining a dominant position in relation to alternative technologies, including ethereum.

4. CBDC(credit-monetary central banknotes) are inherently difficult to replace.

In particular, as we saw through the example of Libra, most of the projects are in limbo at the stage of the conception, rather than replacing Bitcoin.","",""

By Christine Lagarde, IMF Managing Director
Singapore Fintech Festival, November 14, 2018

c) Privacy
The third benefit of digital currency I would like to highlight lies in the privacy domain.
Cash, of course, allows for anonymous payments. We reach for cash to protect our privacy
for legitimate reasons: to avoid exposure to hacking and customer profiling, for instance.
...
Would central banks jump to the rescue and offer a fully anonymous digital currency?
Certainly not. Doing so would be a bonanza for criminals.
..:
Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls would nevertheless run in the
background. If a suspicion arose it would be possible to lift the veil of anonymity and
investigate.
...
This setup would be good for users, bad for criminals, and better for the state, relative to
cash. Of course, challenges remain. My goal, at this point, is to encourage exploration.
...
The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially
semi-anonymous. As you wanted. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments.","",""
