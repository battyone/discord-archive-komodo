so, what i did was make new adaptivepow=N values. using values of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 you can have different levels of sensitivity. the more normal miners you have, the smaller the number can be. so without many miners, then adaptivepow=7 might make sense, but the higher the number the less responsive it will be to hashrate increases.","",""
