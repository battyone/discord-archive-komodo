Oszy told that the kmdice is not maintained.

Is there any plan to fix it? I see there is huge potential on Kmdice. Its success would greatly show the potential of CC and scalability of Kmd's smartchain.

last time I heard, cc-dice is broken, don't know if it get fixed yet

[12-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
this chain was launched with a very early CC which was essentially *just* a proof of concept

[12-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
the people who launched it were warned not to use it yet

[12-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
It's broken. I can rob the house if I wanted

[12-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Alright#0419
@jorian .....killing it?

[12-Dec-19 09:15 PM] Alright#0419
the CC needs a significant rewrite before it can be used in production

[12-Dec-19 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
rob the house, burn the coins? 😅

[12-Dec-19 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
would that finally get it into people's heads that this chain shouldn't be used?

[12-Dec-19 10:51 PM] jorian#4555
This chain shouldn't be used

[12-Dec-19 10:52 PM] jorian#4555
It was a premature release of something that should've been a test

[12-Dec-19 10:53 PM] Alright#0419

welcome back CG, I thought you're gone, the chat would be so boring w/o you 🤣

[12-Dec-19 10:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not back, but some things can't be overlooked
