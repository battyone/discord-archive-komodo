[12-Dec-19 12:55 AM] daemonfox#6136

@blackjok3r does seem to have an issue in that saveit repo... daemon stops staking or outputting anything to the screen... sending another setgenerate true 0 kicks it back on and I can see a large gap in the displayed block height from the last line.

This... ```2019-12-12 14:44:58 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: inputs already spent
```

[12-Dec-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
kills the PoS miner until command sent again
