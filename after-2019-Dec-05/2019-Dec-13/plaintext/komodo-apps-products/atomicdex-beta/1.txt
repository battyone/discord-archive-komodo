I am not a programmer,not sure if my idea is feasible what about instead of using sound,  use stopwatch, when the apps is running in the backgraound the stopwatch starts counting, then when the apps is active , stop the counting and so forth. That way no annoying sound maybe

I would like to see Kmdice on AtomicDex too along with Chips

KMDice is not maintained, wondering why is anyone mining / trading it

[12-Dec-19 11:51 AM] jkluwu0499#8218
Is there any plan to fix it? I see there is huge potential on Kmdice. Its success would greatly show the potential of CC and scalability of Kmd's smartchain.

Btw, there wasnt any official announcement on kmdice, so I didnt know that there was issue and I personally invested on kmdice.
