It is a docker image with text interface to create a chain.  Other tutorials past that first one then explore token creation

@here 
update your npm and yarn installations (if you have them) to the latest. ASAP!
<https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli> 
if you have built our docs locally or tried development using nodejs,  you most likely have one of either npm or yarn

just uninstall them if you don't need them anymore
or update to the latest

Anybody here who tell me the price of enabling dpow

[12-Dec-19 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@pandaanu73 it's free if you do all the work yourself

[12-Dec-19 03:20 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Yes

[12-Dec-19 03:21 PM] pandaanu73#7907
i will do all work myself but in documentation mention dPow enable fee is 365kmd and 365 smartchain coin

[12-Dec-19 03:21 PM] pandaanu73#7907
is it correct

[12-Dec-19 03:21 PM] Markus#5464
@pandaanu73 you can contact a @Service Provider  like @jorian to get a price

[12-Dec-19 03:22 PM] jorian#4555
@dukeleto that is false

[12-Dec-19 03:22 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Means now i can enable it myself

[12-Dec-19 03:22 PM] jorian#4555
@pandaanu73 if you wish to enable dpow through the Komodo Notaries, you pay a fee

[12-Dec-19 03:22 PM] pandaanu73#7907
ok

[12-Dec-19 03:23 PM] pandaanu73#7907
but if want to do it myself

[12-Dec-19 03:23 PM] pandaanu73#7907
then?

[12-Dec-19 03:23 PM] jorian#4555
what do you want to do yourself?

[12-Dec-19 03:23 PM] pandaanu73#7907
enable dPow

[12-Dec-19 03:23 PM] jorian#4555
do you know what dpow is?

[12-Dec-19 03:23 PM] pandaanu73#7907
delayed proof of work

[12-Dec-19 03:24 PM] jorian#4555
yes, and what is that?

[12-Dec-19 03:24 PM] pandaanu73#7907
don't know in detail

[12-Dec-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian what is false?

[12-Dec-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian plz teach me about dpow fine sir

[12-Dec-19 03:26 PM] jorian#4555
@pandaanu73 if you want to enable dpow yourself, you can create your own notary network that does the same as the Komodo notary network. or just simply write checkpoints in the BTC blockchain.

[12-Dec-19 03:30 PM] pandaanu73#7907
If it done by komodo team then what will be the fee?

[12-Dec-19 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian correct, DPoW is just an idea. Totally free. People do not need to trust or pay KMD anything to use the power of DPoW. It's just that KMD has the most skill in running it in prod, and also probably has more BTC in reserve (25years worth ish) for dpow

[12-Dec-19 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@pandaanu73 price is different for everybody, contact somebody at KMD to start negotiations
