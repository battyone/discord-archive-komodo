Paid service in kmd for other community members to run the lp? If there‚Äôs a way to sign tx without knowing keys? üòÇ

imagine if he got elected as the US President right before that

[26-Dec-19 05:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Guess we'll have a female president after all then

[26-Dec-19 05:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
inb4 'did you just assume his gender based on his genitals???????'

[26-Dec-19 05:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Talked to a banker friend of mine today

[26-Dec-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They forecast 5-8% stock market increase next year

[26-Dec-19 06:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(internal forecast)

[26-Dec-19 06:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
UNLESS one of the more outspoken leftist democrats get elected

[26-Dec-19 06:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
then they see stockmarkets react very badly and BIG correction

[26-Dec-19 06:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think more europeans are probably more democrat than pro-trump, but I also like money...

[26-Dec-19 06:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So yeah, guess captain orange for president a little longer :p

[26-Dec-19 07:01 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I used to hear compared to Europe US politics is whole right wing

[26-Dec-19 07:32 PM] richardt#2807
The stock market has been overdue for a major correction

[26-Dec-19 07:32 PM] richardt#2807
The question is, what's it gonna do to the crypto market when that happens üò¨

[26-Dec-19 07:37 PM] richardt#2807
If people are comparing BTC to gold, then BTC (and possibly other crypto) should go up right?

[26-Dec-19 07:46 PM] crumb#2550
hmm, we're still ways off from BTC being considered 'digital gold' by mom-and-pop investors.
all crypto (including BTC) are considered high-risk assets and will get a heavy hit once major equity markets start going down

[26-Dec-19 07:47 PM] crumb#2550
the inevitable QE that follows will of course turn the tides again for crypto

[26-Dec-19 07:49 PM] crumb#2550
as it becomes clear that holding fiat would be totally pointless as its value will be quantitatively eased into oblivion...

[26-Dec-19 07:53 PM] richardt#2807
So ultimately, a correction or recession will provide an opportunity to buy cheap stuff

[26-Dec-19 07:54 PM] richardt#2807
Those in a good position to buy will benefit the most

[26-Dec-19 07:57 PM] richardt#2807
Embarrassing to say, I was a little too young to fully experience, understand and take advantage of the last recession üòÑ

Might want to see this....actually the patterns are pretty similar

Comparing our current bear market with our previous bear market I think we may crash lower than most people are expecting. If you draw a fib circle and a trend line from the peak down to where we started to push up before our parabolic run up.  You will notice in both 2014 an...

this guy called for the 6k capitulation 2 weeks before it happened

[26-Dec-19 08:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@richardt highly doubt a stockmarket crash will be beneficial to crypto , like even without looking at the correlating pairs and what happens to BTC when they did crash before. Hey economy is crashing , let's buy this highly speculative asset that price is controlled by less then 20 whales and exchanges

[26-Dec-19 08:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Wouldn't be suprised to see 3 digit btc in case of a serious crash in stocks , which is long overdue

[26-Dec-19 08:17 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not suprised at all

[26-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Markus#5464
but a bear market does not necessary mean its bad, u can always short and make money

[26-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Markus#5464
just use risk management and low leverage then u wont get rekt

[26-Dec-19 09:23 PM] richardt#2807
It's possible there will be a big crypto bull run right before the stock market crash.  Around the time of BTC halving, perhaps.

[26-Dec-19 09:24 PM] richardt#2807
A final profit taking event before all goes to shit

[26-Dec-19 09:25 PM] richardt#2807
One thing we have seen with previous market crashes is that gold goes up. Anyone buying gold atm?

[26-Dec-19 09:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sibanye gold corp :p

[26-Dec-19 09:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But they do mostly palladium and some others

[26-Dec-19 11:09 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Bought some silver, but that gets bulky real fast

[26-Dec-19 11:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Would only buy substantial amounts of fysical gold if I had a better secured house

[26-Dec-19 11:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
