[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> The Functionality of Privacy Coins:
We will be hearing from Coin Center, Chainalysis, and Ciphertrace on the functionality of, and challenges presented by, privacy coins.
<https://vimeo.com/379765960/a813511f6a>

If anyone is interested in listening in ^
Basically skip the first 19 minutes. An interesting part about WannaCry and the coin shuffling afterwards at `19:15`
`21:50` shows shapeshift public API showing a random BTC > XMR transaction including IDs, IP addresses, but then loses it with the XMR explorer. No mention of ringCT pool size issues.
`24:27` brings up discussion on Dash and Zcash "Optional Privacy"
`"...who is using TAILS from USB, he will not try to install lightweight operating system, and then DASH core(to send private transactions), after which he will have to download 12GBs of blockchain"` Honestly seems like a good argument for GhostShipOS

[26-Dec-19 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> IMPORTANT `33:05`  `"All of these electronic currencies, bitcoin, ethereum and all the privacy coins, are going to fall under a regulation that FINCEN has had for some years. and that the Financial action task force, which is based in Paris, has proposed for global adoption by mid next year. This is called the Travel Rule. This is a regulation that will enforce virtual assets service providers, so exchanges, hosted wallets, custody providers etc. to not only have KYC info, but to also exchange that when transactions are made between those organizations"`

Financial Action Task Force: <http://www.fatf-gafi.org/> 
Travel Rule Page 3: <https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/aml2007/fincen-advissu7.pdf>

[26-Dec-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> `32% of top 120 exchanges support privacy coins in and out`
`63% of top 120 exchanges have either no KYC or "Porous" KYC`

[26-Dec-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> `20-30% of Dark markets support privacy coins`

[26-Dec-19 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> Monero ViewKeys does not satisfy "Travel Rule"

[26-Dec-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> `43:50` `"zcash does have a mechanism for potentially incorporating Travel rules, CypherTrace and other companies are beginning to work with the Zcash team and Electric coin company on integration of the tools into that blockchain"`

[26-Dec-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> `44:48` FinCEN regulation basically saying if you are a virtual asset provider and you receive coins, you must track those coins through different transactions, but also must implement procedures to obtain the identity of the transmitter or recipient.

[26-Dec-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> "If a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) cannot manage and mitigate the risk...should not be permitted to engage in such activities [of being a wallet or exchange]"

[26-Dec-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> Basically the summary of an hour long meeting of a bunch of law enforcement and blockchain analysis companies on the functionality and role of privacy coins. Thanks for reading my poorly organized notes. 😄

[26-Dec-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> esp if someone is to create one like btc with no controlling "entity"

[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> comply or be shudown

[26-Dec-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> as the waters of blockchain always are...it be murky out there crew

[26-Dec-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> They look to pressure service providers to implement KYC. Even if the wallet is non custodial, they can still try and force those service providers to take KYC on setup of the app. like making you register your KYC info before the wallet even can be used, and when you submit that info it likely submits your public key/address along with it (not the private key, so they can call it "non custodial")

[26-Dec-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> obviously this won't work everywhere.

[26-Dec-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> I actually see this as good news to a degree, it ultimately will be worked around, cat and mouse, but its alway sbeen that way

[26-Dec-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> adoption on the other hand...not great news for

[26-Dec-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> unless the population as a whole decides security and privacy are higher importance, there will always be those who do, getting more people to care....

[26-Dec-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> looking forward to the world where we have decentralized hosting, on decentralized storage, using app built for decentralization...

[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> what they can do is ban legal usage - ban online shops from using it, but currently is not an issue - crypto is used more for gambling then buying

[26-Dec-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝕲𝖎𝖌𝖆𝖒𝖊𝖘𝖍 𝖙𝖍𝖊 𝕻𝖔𝖜𝖉𝖊𝖗 𝕸𝖔𝖓𝖐𝖊𝖞> even tho its  washtrading and  and id never use it if i could avoid it, ive noticed Hotbit has a knack for listing some good coins shortly before bigger listings emerge

[26-Dec-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> every top exchange is good - others will judge Pirate better - kind of snowball effect with listings may happen

[26-Dec-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> I think the argument could be, and will be made that privacy and security do not have to go hand in hand with wallets. They will say they can do KYC before the wallet is created, include the wallet address in that information, but never touch the private keys (but also not let multiple addresses be created) then the VASP will hold a data base of users and their addresses, track user funds and build networks of addresses, without having to hold any keys. That will probably be the proposed tradeoff.

[26-Dec-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> They first go for wallet companies, then for google play/apple store wallets. And maybe even eventually github (though I'm getting pretty extreme here)

[26-Dec-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> Open source, decentralized products will be the last chance for non KYC wallets. But it's possible for custodial wallets to freeze someone's funds if they receive transactions from non KYC wallets, until the user reports on them (be it their friends, family, or customers)

[26-Dec-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Regnar> Again I'm being extreme here

[26-Dec-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> hey it needs to be said outloud 🙂

In the last week, the MetaMask Android client was suspended by the Google Play App Store @googleplaydev. They cited their policy that bans mining on mobile, which we don't. Appeal rejected. #ProtectWeb3.

Any explanation for how piratechain works? No public transactions? How are amounts verified?

@steinsg8 👆🏽

[26-Dec-19 10:24 PM] steinsg8#0288
But isn't piratechain only private transactions? Does that make a difference,?

[26-Dec-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> It makes no difference as far as the zero-knowledge proofs of any given transaction being valid
That PIRATE is z only does, however, make a difference in to ability to secure the privacy of each transaction, though
