I see the options to not play at full volume but still get annoying change sounds coming through. Also, it looks like each time I load atomicdex on phone i have to go in to settings and un-choose 'play at full volume'.","",""

there is no need for the screen to be on (this is what the sounds fix was for)
but the app must be open in the background","",""

I have my phone setup to hibernate quickly after screen goes off, i may have to install this onto my other phone and just keep it on all the time. Are there any user inputs needed on the part of a maker for trades to happen that are already setup to be advertised on orderbook?

And on that subject, if i have the same atomic dex seed running simultaneously on two phones will that cause issues?","",""

yes, there may be issues
the case of same seed running on two devices is undefined. that is , it wasn't considered when atomicDEX was  developed
it is not recommended to do so

> I have my phone setup to hibernate quickly after screen goes off
this will cause the maker to go offline, that is no swaps

>  i may have to install this onto my other phone and just keep it on all the time
good idea

> Are there any user inputs needed on the part of a maker for trades to happen that are already setup to be advertised on orderbook
nothing else is needed. have sufficient balances and place orders. thats it","",""

yes. but transferring funds out while there is an active order may cause swaps to fail","",""
