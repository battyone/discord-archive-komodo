[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ETH is getting attacked via their shitty hardfork code: https://twitter.com/SDLerner/status/1211902701526749185

@ParityTech The attack is simple: you send to a Parity node a block with invalid transactions, but valid header (borrowed from another block)
The node will mark the block header as invalid and ban this block header forever but the header is still valid.
