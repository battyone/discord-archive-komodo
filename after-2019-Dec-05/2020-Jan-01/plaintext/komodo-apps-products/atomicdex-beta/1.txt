What will the fees be when it's ready for launch? https://atomicwallet.io/ currently $7017 for 1 BTC which really sucks.

When will AtomicDex be available on IOS??

[31-Dec-19 05:20 AM] Acura#2748
@CryptoSurfer you can already use it on iOS

[31-Dec-19 05:21 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
@Acura no it‚Äôs still in the beta testnet phase

[31-Dec-19 07:04 AM] Bitfinger#6245
@CryptoSurfer you are correct it is beta, but it is definitely not testnet.

[31-Dec-19 07:14 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
@Bitfinger since it‚Äôs only beta, when Alpha then?

[31-Dec-19 07:14 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Unfortunately that's not something I can answer, sorry  @CryptoSurfer

[31-Dec-19 07:15 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
Can anybody here answer that?

[31-Dec-19 07:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
yes --- Alfa started in  2016

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢   here  we  go again

[31-Dec-19 07:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
If  you are  asking for  official  release  date @CryptoSurfer

[31-Dec-19 07:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
like  RC1

[31-Dec-19 07:27 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
Already got my question answered in ask jl777 chat. I don‚Äôt think u guys understood my question üëç

@kmdkrazy

[31-Dec-19 07:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
just wondering what you require for a release to be  called a  release -- its pretty 
 much released --- but I would say a different date if  you  ask me when mass adoption by end users would be.... I guess JL satisfied your question. Have a great new  year.

[31-Dec-19 08:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Agile,  devOps and the phrase ‚Äúrelease early and often‚Äù may be a better  way of describing the release process here... Isnt this out  of "Beta" on Google Play at least? I think anyone can use the iOS version as well....  "a beta version of software is released to a specific group of users"~Google -  @CryptoSurfer

[31-Dec-19 08:09 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@CryptoSurfer 
Alpha = Before any meaningful testing.
Beta = In testing, but before 1st release.

*traditionally

[31-Dec-19 08:16 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
I'd like to think that we've already *released* a beta version (a "beta release", cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta). And we're making new releases often! There are also concepts of a *stable release* (when we're happy with where we are), *opening the source* and *store release* (when the application is freely available in application store search and can be installed without subscribing to a beta testing).

I agree with James in that we need to improve the order matching before we can consider the AtomicDEX to be stable. And we have a number of other modifications on the way.

[31-Dec-19 08:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Order  matching comes in  Market Maker 2 though correct?

[31-Dec-19 08:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I dont want to confuse the dude ...but

[31-Dec-19 08:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Back to couch -- I dont really need to know

[31-Dec-19 08:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
have good nights

[31-Dec-19 08:26 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
MM is an integral part of order matching, yes, but different layers can participate in it and in different capacity. Right now, for example, the user is essentially selecting a specific order. There is up-matching (an order with a better price can be used automatically), but if I select a best price (with no better prices past it) then I've essentially picked a specific order, which might be in fact unavailable due to a number of reasons.

[31-Dec-19 08:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
oh yeah yeah yeah

[31-Dec-19 08:35 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
Go read the jl777 chat. iOS version is not fully operational yet

[31-Dec-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it is operational

[31-Dec-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
and at normal loads will work just fine

[31-Dec-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it just wont scale up to 100s of simultaneous swaps now

[31-Dec-19 08:51 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
I used the term fully operational because of need of test flight app

[31-Dec-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess "not fully available" makes sense, but it is fully operational

[31-Dec-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
initial version of the decentralized orderbook transport layer tested out better than expected with a limit of about 50,000 orders per hour and 4000 orders in one minute burst limit.
this is with the simplistic internal searching algo. still need to get it validated with much higher number of nodes than the 12 nodes i used, but this is a very good start and the goal of being able to handle much much higher levels of traffic is now within reach.

one of the design goals was to minimize wasted bandwidth transmitting the same data to the same node, but still making it fast enough so orders propagate in a few seconds. in my three hour test of 30,000+ orders, all the nodes were 100% in sync and there was less than 1% of excess bandwidth

[31-Dec-19 01:49 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
also this p2p layer in komodod is a general-purpose technology! (giving us more freedom in how to use it for order matching)

[31-Dec-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, for any usecase where 100% consensus isnt critical, this can be very handy. it is like UDP as opposed to TCP. usually it will be just fine, but if things get overloaded, it will start dropping packets randomly

[31-Dec-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
however, it shouldnt ever end up getting deadlocked and when the load reduces, things will get back in sync again

interesting ux challenge I'm sure has been discussed. I have some KMD but can't trade my way into ETH unless I already have ETH on my wallet to pay for gas

[31-Dec-19 06:17 PM] LeshAft9#0083
So, using the android app. if you create an order, do you need to have the app running when somebody fills it so that you can complete the trade? also, not sure if this is a bug but the app continuously makes the sound of coins clinking after I create an order

[31-Dec-19 06:19 PM] ca333#0118
yes - thats a limitation and affects ETH/ERC swaps only. Technically we likely could redesign the atomic-swap protocol in order to enforce the ETH/ERC side of a swap to cover all gas fees. This is something we might look into at some point.

[31-Dec-19 06:20 PM] LeshAft9#0083
interesting

[31-Dec-19 06:21 PM] ca333#0118
`if you create an order, do you need to have the app running when somebody fills it so that you can complete the trade?` yes the app needs to run (at least in background mode) to execute swaps. There aren't only mobile clients/peers - the network also consists of a set of server/desktop based DEX nodes/peers.

[31-Dec-19 06:22 PM] ca333#0118
the background sound is a new and experimental feature and we are working on improving this - a new version is coming out very soon.

[31-Dec-19 06:23 PM] LeshAft9#0083
haha OK thanks. there is a setting for whether to play at full volume but unfortunately it can't be muted entirely. So I'd have to walk around with my phone making that noise (it plays in the background as well) until somebody filled my order!
