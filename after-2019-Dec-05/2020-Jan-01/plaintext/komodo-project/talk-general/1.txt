is a DEX planned for NFT's?  I think the future market for NFTs will be very big.  will komodo offer a solution, will we have to wait for a third-party solution or will the NFT's only be traded in-game, so that the game developer himself has to provide a place to trade?

@Jimm B. if it is an NFT created on a smartchain using Tokens cc, it can already be traded on chain just like normal tokens

yes, I was just thinking about whether Komodo might offer a solution.  like steam, and every game released on the platform will be available for trading NFT's directly on the marketplace.
